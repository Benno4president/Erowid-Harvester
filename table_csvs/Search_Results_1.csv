94343,Puzzling Out a Recipe and a Magic Experience,Maggie1215,"Mar 6, 2012","Ayahuasca (B. caapi & P. viridis), Magic Mushrooms, Amanita muscaria, & Syrian Rue","This is my account as a first-time ayahuasca brewer and user trying to puzzle out a workable recipe using conflicting information gathered from the internet. I post this in the hope that it may help others in their experimentation. Its quite long and detailed, because I was exploring many questions about optimal preparation and consumption. I focus on these aspects.    First, let me say about myself that I am a PhD student in cognitive psychology, interested in consciousness and the workings of the mind. Ive taken a graduate psychopharmacology class and done lots of reading on the subject. I have been a life-long empiricist and atheist until I was introduced to psychedelics by my boyfriend about 4 months ago, which has spurred a sort of spiritual awakening and exploration. Starting out with small doses of psilocybin mushrooms, which he grew himself, I have worked my way up from mild trips to a full-blown 6-gram (dried weight) experience. I have also used weed a bit (not very often, I have a difficult time smoking), salvia a few times (plain, 5x, 10x and 20x  all of which I found interesting but too short lasting) and amanita muscaria (which was pleasant, contrary to many internet accounts). My typical drug of choice is alcohol, both beer and red wine, rarely liquor, and I drink several times a week. Ive also tired nootropics (piracetam, aniracetam) and antidepressants (Effexor, Celexa, Lexapro, Prozac, St. Johns Wort).    My boyfriend is a very experienced psychedelic user, of at least 20 years duration, but had never tried ayahuasca and had always wanted to. We wanted to use the brew for meaningful spiritual exploration, not simply as a new or more intense high. He also is a near daily user of cannabis, and used some throughout the experience detailed below. I did not.     So we decided to welcome in the year 2012 by brewing some. I tried to find an appropriate recipe online by browsing the internet. This was the first problem, as there is extreme variation in recipes, measures and methods. We wanted to start out with an authentic traditional recipe, just Banisteriopsis caapi (sometimes by itself called ayahuasca) and Psychotria viridis (chacruna), with no other additives. However, I found recipes that called for 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 ratios of caapi to chacruna. Even more confusing, some recipes called for a certain number of chacruna leaves, not a given weight. Leaf size was not specified either. And while some recipes specified fresh chacruna, few mentioned dried. More often, recipes just gave a weight, not mentioning fresh or dried at all. I was left wondering which to use and if there was any difference in potency between the two, suspecting that there must be. As mushroom users know, theres a big difference between the weight of fresh and dried you should use. Likewise, when cooking, you must use much more fresh herb (of any sort, such as basil, etc) than dried. To further confuse the issue, at least three different types of caapi were available  red, white, and yellow  in several different forms  shredded, powdered or whole young vine. Allusions were made to different characteristics of different strains/colors, such as white is hardest to work with, but nothing specific. Most recipes just said caapi. How to decide?    In the spirit of experimentation, I ordered 4 oz (112g) each of white shredded bark, yellow powdered, and young red vine said to be from a strain from T. McKennas plantation. I also ordered 150 g of dried chacruna leaves. The leaves arrived broken into many pieces  there was no way to tell how many leaves there had been originally.  Good thing I decided to go by weight. The leaves were a dark blackish green in color, and slightly dusty smelling. The shredded caapi looked and smelled like rough mulch. My goal was to use a 1:1 ratio of about 200 g of caapi to 200 g of chacruna, and these were the best approximations I could get based on how the items were packaged and sold.     Following is the digest of a lot conflicting recipes and accounts that I read  at least 50 from both websites and academic journals (Journal of Psychoactive Drugs is a good one, as is Psychopharmacology; good researchers are Callaway and Riba. I will give specific references at the end of this account). I found several recurring themes.     1) Some accounts suggested that a smaller proportion of caapi to chacruna resulted in less stomach upset  we were quite cognizant of the fact that we might vomit or have diarrhea, and wanted to minimize it. So I settled on a using close to a 1:1 ratio of caapi to chacruna. I ended up using the white shredded bark and red young vines, for a total of 224 grams of caapi, and the whole bag of 150 g of chacruna. (So if you want to get technical, its a ratio of about 1.5:1). See Note 1 at the end of this account for more info about the appropriate/tolerable amount of caapi.    2) Some recipes advised throwing everything in a big pot together and boiling for 10-12 hours. Others said to prepare each plant separately and to do multiple washes/extractions, then to either combine them at the end or to drink separately.  The timing varied from boiling each wash from 5 minutes to 2-3 hours! It seemed from reading many accounts that the most stomach upset/vomiting occurred from the throw everything together and boil vigorously for 10-12 hour recipes, while the do several washes, simmer and strain recipes led to less vomiting and nausea.     3) Some recipes said to add a teaspoon of so of lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar, to each wash, though they didnt say why. Later reading suggested that acidifying the water speeded up the extraction process  thus, requiring a shorter amount of time simmering. Perhaps that was why some recipes said to boil for as little as 5 minutes per wash. A few recipes called for using grapefruit, orange or pineapple juice to make the resulting liquid sweeter  however, in their results, the brewers who used these methods often complained the ayahuasca didnt work, so I steered away from using these juices, which arent as acidic as lemon or lime or vinegar. (In reading technical accounts in academic journals, I found that most analyses of authentic ayahuasca found it to have a pH of about 3.5, eg Callaway 2005.) A few accounts said to use anywhere from 250-1000 mg citric acid, presumably dumped out of a capsule or a dissolved dietary supplement. One recipe used muratic acid, which I assumed meant muriatic acid, which is liquid hydrochloric acid (HCl), a corrosive acid used in swimming pools and for cleaning masonry and doesnt seem at all a good idea for something youre going to drink! That recipe produced vomiting, according to its author.    4) Some recipes said to boil; others said never to boil, only to simmer. I mostly simmered, even though that meant it took longer to reduce the liquid. Later I read that simmering rather than boiling resulted in a sweeter (or at least less bitter) brew, due to no carmelization of the plant material (according to the author) at below boiling temperatures. My brew was bitter, but not too bad. (One discussion thread I found online said not to boil, as you would destroy (vaporize, they said) the DMT by doing so. However, no other accounts said anything about this. Nonetheless, I tried to mostly simmer the liquids, as I certainly didnt want to lose any DMT, though I think it must vaporize at a higher temperature than boiling.)    5) Most recipes were quite clear against using aluminum pots, saying toxic aluminum salts could result, especially with an acidifying agent.  I made sure my pans were non-aluminum. Pyrex (glass) is a good idea.    6) Most recipes advised using distilled water to avoid any added chemicals, such as chlorine. I did so, about 4.5 gallons altogether (which was reduced by simmering over 6 hours to about 4 cups total).    7) Many experienced users recommended brewing 2 doses per person, in case one was lost to vomiting. Of course, defining a dose was quite confusing due to all the conflicting recipes. I defined a dose as approximately 50 g of caapi and 50 g of dried chacruna. Though the proportions I ended up using were slightly different (I ended up consuming extract from about 60 g caapi and 40 g chacruna.)     8) Some recipes said to drink the caapi about 30 minutes prior to the chacruna. Others said to mix together and drink at the same time. We decided to keep ours separate and 30 minutes apart, thinking that way the MAOI in the caapi would have time to work before the DMT-containing chacruna. (Naturally occurring MAOs in the digestive tract break down oral DMT  the MAO inhibitor in the caapi prevents this. It seemed logical that we should give the MAOI a little bit of time to start inhibiting the MAO before we consumed the DMT so as to reduce breakdown and optimize absorption.)     9) Many recipes advised straining/filtering several times and/or letting the sediment naturally settle over time, suggesting the sediment caused gagging and triggered vomiting. So we did so.    The brew preparation    T 9.00.  At 9:30 am, I added 112 g of white shredded caapi bark, 112 grams of young red caapi vine, 2/3 gallon of distilled water, and a big squirt of lemon and lime juices (probably about a teaspoons worth) to a saucepan and brought it to a boil. I then simmered and stirred it for an hour. The liquid turned a dark reddish-brown immediately. I had tried to further grind the young red vine in my coffee grinder, but had no luck, it kept getting caught and wouldnt really grind, so I just broke it into smaller pieces and threw it in the pot. In retrospect, I wish I had pounded it or crushed it or tried harder to break open the red vine, because I feel like the resulting extract was weak.     At the same time, I put the 150 grams of dried, broken up chacruna leaves in a different pot with 2/3 gallon of water and a squirt of lemon and lime juices and brought it to a boil.  I then simmered it for 2 hours, stirring quite often. At first the liquid was dark greenish-brown, but over several hours it became black. (It looked like black bean soup.)    T 8.00.  At 10:30 am, I took the caapi liquid out, filtered it through a wire mesh strainer, and put it in a smaller saucepan to reduce. I added another 2/3 gallon of water plus more lemon and lime juices to the original caapi vine/bark and simmered it for another hour or so. (The instructions I found online had suggested simmering each wash for anywhere from 5 minutes to 2-3 hours; I compromised on 1-2 hours.) Now I had 3 pans going: the original caapi and chacruna, and one more caapi liquid only.    T 7.00.  At 11:30 am, I strained the chacruna (it seemed to take longer to steep than the caapi  the leaves floated on the surface, and I kept the heat lower so they wouldnt float over the top). Now I had 4 pans going, the 2 original brews and 2 liquids to reduce. I returned the chacruna to the pot, added more distilled water (enough to cover, still about 2/3 gallon) and more lemon and lime juices and brought to a boil, then simmer, again.     T -6.00 through T -3.00. I repeated this process 1 more time each with the caapi and chacruna, so that each gave 3 washes total. By 3:30 I had only the 2 pots with liquid reducing on the stove and was done with the vine and leaves, which I composted.     At various times, I strained each liquid, first using a small mesh wire strainer, like one of those permanent coffee filters, then later trying to use a paper coffee filter. The sediment clogged the paper coffee filter, and I gave up on that method.     T -2.00. I kept filtering, simmering and reducing the liquids until I had slightly less than 2 cups of each. This took until about 4:30 pm.  At this point, I poured each out into a large glass container so that further sediment could settle to the bottom.     Some side notes on the cooking process:  For at least the first few hours, my kitchen smelled strongly of dirt and mulch. At first it was a very acrid, pungent smell, and it spread throughout the house. However, the smell mellowed very much over time, and after a few hours was non-objectionable.     Also, quite a lot of steam was produced throughout this entire process  I had the kitchen exhaust fan going for hours and a window cracked open even though it was snowing outside. Windows throughout the house fogged over. We felt as though we were actually in a steamy rainforest.     Personal preparation and consumption    Knowing that the caapi is a MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), we abstained from tyramine rich foods all day (no aged cheeses, meats, alcohol, etc.), but didnt entirely fast. (Many ayahuasca drinkers describe fasting for a day or two before imbibing, but we felt ok just abstaining from problem foods). I had coffee with nonfat milk at about 8 am (T 10.5), but no food. My boyfriend had black coffee and a piece of dry toast with strawberry jelly at noon (T 6.5), as well as a clementine in the late afternoon.  I had 2-3 cups of peppermint tea (100% peppermint leaf) throughout the afternoon, and 3 saltine crackers. I hoped the peppermint might help reduce nausea.    T 0.  At 6:15 pm, we were ready. We had slightly less than 2 cups total of each liquid, which I had calculated to be 4 doses. I scooped out about \xbd c. of caapi for each of us, trying to leave most of the sediment in the bottom. At this point, the liquid was no longer a dark reddish-brown, but a light yellowish-brown. After offering a prayer, we sipped our drinks over about 15-20 minutes. We had read that sipping it slowly over time helped reduce nausea. It was bitter, but not as bad as Id been expecting.     T +0.5.  After a \xbd hour, I scooped out about \xbd. c. of the chacruna liquid for each of us. This was dark black, like black bean soup, and had a lot of sediment. Both of us felt fine before drinking the chacruna, no nausea at all. Once again, we sipped slowly over about 15-20 minutes. It was very bitter and chalky, much worse tasting and grittier than the caapi, but not awful. As my boyfriend neared the end of his, he noted that it contained a lot of sediment. As soon as he said that, he said he was going to lose it and ran to the bathroom. He spent about the next 10 minutes vomiting up everything. I continued to sip mine slowly, avoiding the sediment. At one point when I neared the sediment, I nearly gagged, but was able to stop it. Also, he had consumed a Clementine right before the caapi, (plus the toast and coffee earlier) while I hadnt eaten anything but the 3 saltines around noon and the peppermint tea. Wikipedia, citing Ott (1994), says that traditionally caffeine and citrus are avoided prior to ayahausca consumption, though recent researchers are casting doubt on whether these dietary restrictions are necessary. (See note #2 below.)     [Erowid Note:  Combining MAOIs with other psychoactive drugs carries serious medical risks and can result in extremely unpleasant side effects, overheating, nausea, confusion, heart problems, and even death. Please see <a href=\'/chemicals/maois/maois.shtml\'>Erowid\'s MAOI Vault]      T +1.00. I feel fine, no nausea.  My boyfriend feels better after purging, but doesnt want to try any more ayahuasca. We sit back to wait, watching some videos. Id read that onset of effects could take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours, and more toward the longer end if you sipped it slowly rather than chugging it all at once, so Im trying to be patient.     T +1.50.  I examine myself for signs of effects. I feel slightly warm and flushed, a feeling I associate with serotonin (as from taking a migraine pill), maybe a bit of tightness around my eyes like I get with mushroom onset, but no CEV or other effects. We close our eyes and perhaps imagine that we are seeing the slightest flashes of color. I am impatient. My boyfriend smokes a bowl.     T +2.00.  Still nothing. I conclude the brew didnt work. I pull out a bag of Syrian rue and chew up about a grams worth of seeds, thinking maybe I didnt make the caapi strong enough or drink enough for the MAOI to work. I pour myself an additional \xbc c. each of both caapi and chacruna and start sipping. I also eat about 10 saltines, figuring its a lost cause. Im feeling good, chatty, energized, bubbly, which I attribute to the MAOI effects of the caapi (MAOIs are used as antidepressants; caapi on its own is also said to be a stimulant, eg Rodd 2008), but feel nothing else.     In the meantime, my boyfriend is feeling better and decides to try to salvage the evening by brewing a psilocybin mushroom tea. It is New Years Eve after all, and we are afraid to drink alcohol due to the MAOI. We have a small amount of shrooms, about 1-2 g (unfortunately, we didnt weight them), estimated at enough for one person to have a very mild experience. In a what the heck, why not? mode, we toss the mushrooms in a pan along with about 1 gram of crushed Syrian rue (also an MAOI, we hope it might potentiate and stretch the mushrooms), then also add 25 g of amanita muscaria weve been meaning to try (hes never had any, but I had tested myself on 5 grams brewed into a tea a few weeks ago. I found them to have a very mild effect, similar to drinking a glass of wine, and no nausea; these are a mixture of grade A large 3 Latvian caps and grade A+ small 1 Washington caps ordered from the internet). We also add a slice of fresh ginger and herbal peppermint-based tea (not 100% peppermint leaf  this is Candy Cane Lane Xmas decaf green tea, and also contains milk thistle  recommended by several online accounts to go with the amanita  vanilla, and other flavors).    T +2.25. We drink our tea over about 15-20 minutes, wary of nausea from the amanitas. We experience none. We are listening to Icaros of the Shipibo people culled from the internet to get us in the proper spiritual frame of mind.    T +2.50 or so. Onset is rapid. Something has finally worked in a major way. I dont know if it was the extra MAOI from the additional caapi or Syrian rue, or the shrooms, or simply time. At this point I lose all sense of time. The rest of the night is sheer magic for me, though not quite as strong for my boyfriend since he lost most or all of his ayahuasca, and I had an additional gram of Syrian rue. Let me just say the experience was everything I had read about and hoped for, totally cosmic, spiritual, out of body. I am full of love and gratitude and feel a sense of timelessness and eternity and oneness with the universe, I feel my boyfriend and I are dreaming its creation. I feel whole and complete and perfect. I feel accepting of every part of myself, even the parts I dislike and try to hide. I feel healed. I have wonderful OEV and CEV. I want this moment to last forever. I feel suspended in time. Spirits walk with us and we commune with them. My boyfriend sees the Mayan calendar unraveled in his mind, and speaks with ancient shamans.     In contrast to my previous experiences with mushrooms, which were more autobiographical in tone (eg, working out conflict with my mother and my brother, reliving childhood, reuniting with my dead father), this one is strictly about myself and my relation to the cosmos.    My experience lasts roughly from 10 pm til 4:30 am, when I start to come out of the bliss phase but am still seeing splashes of color with my eyes open. My boyfriends experience, while nearly as intense, ended about 1 \xbd hours previously. (He said it was close to, but not the most, intense experience hed ever had.) Throughout this roughly 6 hours, he also smoked a bit, estimating that in total he consumed 2 bowls of what he called high grade weed.     T +10.  Aftermath: We feel a little twitchy, and my muscles feel as if I worked out my upper body with weights and did a bit of light running or biking. My whole body feels stiff when I stand up to go to the bathroom, and walking feels strange. Mentally, I feel centered, energized, blissful  just really, really good. We have a bit of trouble falling asleep (have some great sex  body sensations are definitely heightened!), and stay awake for another hour or so. Finally fall asleep by about 6 am and sleep til about 10 am. We awake ravenous and have the best food we have ever tasted in our lives. He feels tired and heavy and unmotivated all day, which he partially attributes to the weed, but I continue to feel great, with only a bit of a headache and jaw clench (both of which I tend to get from too much serotonin  analyses of blood plasma levels in ayahuasca drinkers have shown elevated serotonin levels for 1-2 days afterward, eg Calloway 1999, and I subjectively feel as if my serotonin levels are high).    T +40. The next morning, (this is now 2 days later) I start to feel a bit shaky, sweaty, and light-headed, a feeling I get when tapering off antidepressants too quickly (Im not taking any currently or wouldnt have messed around with an MAOI). I pop a 100 mg 5-HTP capsule (a serotonin precursor) and quickly feel better. Except the headache/jaw clench returns, but its not too bad, overall I still feel great and energized.     Both of us rated this as one of the most spiritual experiences we have ever had. I dont know what single element or combination of elements finally worked, but it was simply magic. Were looking forward to trying a slightly different version, made with Syrian rue and mimosa, and will definitely try the mushroom/Syrian rue combo on its own again, as well as amanitas on their own or maybe with Syrian rue. But a word of warning: make sure you know what youre dealing with, especially as regards the MAOI. Look it up online, make sure you eat correctly. And be prepared for vomiting or diarrhea. I was lucky  I had no nausea at all, but I tend to have a strong stomach. I believe the low proportion of caapi to chacruna, the slow sipping, and the filtering out of the majority of sediment all helped to reduce the nausea/vomiting experience.     Admittedly, in scientific terms this was not a clean experiment  too many variables. However, I think the differences between our 2 experiences, the fact that mine lasted nearly 2 hours longer and was so blissful, was due to the additional MAOI and DMT I consumed. Since my boyfriend vomited so early, we assume he lost all of his DMT and most of the MAOI from the caapi. And as an experienced mushroom user, he said he got much more of an effect out of the paltry 0.5-1 g of mushrooms he consumed than he would have expected, which we attribute to the MAOI in the Syrian rue. (Like all psychedelics, mushrooms increase levels of serotonin; the MAOI allows this serotonin to last longer rather than being broken down right away, thus potentiating or intensifying the mushrooms effects. In other online accounts I read, it seems as if adding a MAOI effectively doubles the dose of mushrooms.)     Note to point #1, about proportion of caapi and vomiting: Calloway (2005) suggested that the effective dose of caapi in terms of MAOI is near the point of emesis (vomiting, that is). He believes vomiting is a natural reflex against an overdose of the harmala alkaloids in the caapi that function as the MAOI. Thus, he believes it is impossible to take a fatal dose. The point here is that the effective dose hovers right around the amount that makes you vomit. The MAOI also increases intestinal motility (by increasing gut serotonin levels) according to Calloway  too much motility leads to explosive expulsion of the contents of your gut, from the other end.     Note #2, about dietary restrictions. Conventional wisdom on the internet says that since the harmala alkaloids in the caapi (and Syrian rue) function as MAOIs, all tyramine containing foods should be avoided before and after use. However, it appears that these alkaloids are reversible MAOIs (the irreversible MAOIs, such as drugs used as antidepressants,  take up to 2 weeks to recover from) and furthermore only act on the MAO-A system, leaving the MAO-B system intact and working, thus dietary restrictions might be unnecessary. However, in the lack of definitive research, I figure better safe than sorry!  Additionally, recent and seemingly little publicized research on coffee found it to inhibit both the MAO-A and MAO-B systems (Herraiz, 2006). Thus, perhaps my boyfriend had more MAO inhibition going on at the time of drinking the chacruna than I did, which may have caused his vomiting, since as Callaway (2005) found, the effective vs. vomiting-inducing doses are quite close.     Another note: In several analyses of ayahuasca ingredients, Calloway et al. (2005) found wide variation in the levels of active components. For instance, 32 samples of caapi varied from containing 0.31 mg/g to 8.43 mg/g of harmaline alkaloids, while 36 samples of chacruna varied between containing 0.0 mg/g  (yes, 0) of DMT to 7.5 mg/g. Furthermore, levels of DMT in chacruna leaves taken from the same plant at different times over the course of a day could vary in strength. This natural variation only makes it more difficult to estimate proper amounts of the plants to use in tea making. Thus, I believe you should brew at least 2 doses per person and be patient (wait at least 2 hours) before taking more. Leftovers can be frozen for future use, according to internet accounts. I have one leftover dose frozen, and will see how it works in a future encounter.     I also have 4 oz (112 g) of the yellow powdered caapi left to experiment with. Powdered bark was said to be hard to work with by many online accounts  after dealing with the sediment and its filter-clogging and gag-triggering effects, I now understand why. If I use it in the future, I may try to construct some kind of giant tea bag filter, maybe sewing 2 coffee filters together around it or finding some very fine cheesecloth to bag it in.

81421,Juxtaposition of All Selves into Singularity,FantomeCiel,"Mar 23, 2010",Mushrooms,"I always assumed that those legendary bad trips I heard about in anti-drug literature, and from my parents, didnt actually happen. Well, they do happen, and the cause of mine was a combination of a familiar dose, with an unfamiliar batch, filtered through some philosophical misconceptions I had. However, I will hold the experience as one of the most important, defining moments in my life. It was the moment I came closest to both complete ego-death, as well as actual, physical death, and I offer my experience to anyone who is interested in psychedelics, to be warned and prepared for the type of tests you must sometimes face if you ever accidentally hit that ceiling of consciousness.    It was early July, and me and my true love, who will henceforth be referred to as V., were going to again take a trip to that dazzling psychedelic mushroom-land in celebration of her birthday. We had tripped several times before together, and we have a very loving fulfilling, relationship. So I was expecting the best, and I was in a very happy, excited mood.     But first, some information about my drug history. Ive taken probably more than 75 total DXM trips, which has created a continuum of mental activity, leading eventually into an unpleasant, cramped mental box. DXM was my first outlet to different realms of consciousness, but it is a very small path, one without any real spiritual knowledge. For me, DXM caused acne, depression, high blood pressure, and different pupil sizes for days after trips.     I had used Salvia probably 20 times, and never had a bad trip. Once, a party was held by some mischievous entity, who informed me that I was The most fucked up anyone has ever been, and so I got to see the truth. Banners advertising Reality Is An Illusion! flew, streamers, confetti. My friends got up and celebrated with kazoos. Since this experience, I feel like any further experimentation with Salvia would be interpreted as insolence by that mysterious consciousness which inhabits the soul of the plant.     Ive done mushrooms and acid probably a combined 20 times, (I lose track of which experiences belong to which drug, they are very similar to me) and once even induced a bad trip by listening to Wolf Eyes, (a horror-noise band) as a test, and out of curiosity. Every time Ive done mushrooms I have taken the same dose, (3.5 grams) as I did this time, and it goes to show you that you should always take a preliminary dose with a new batch to ensure that you are prepared.  Indeed, the mushrooms we had were supposed to be very strong; their stems were marked with purple and blue spirals, which I assume indicates a high presence of hallucinogenic potency. A friend of ours, having taken the same dosage, had become lost in a Columbus park, mistaking his environment for Egypt. I figured that it wouldnt be an issue for someone with the aforementioned Salvia experience under my belt, so I took the full 3.5 grams in one sitting, slathering them in peanut butter.     (+0:30) Me and V. went outside, to the lot behind my apartment. Both of us are artists connected to our inner child, so we were planning to go draw with sidewalk chalk. I had taken a book on Michelangelo, and I was hoping to reproduce one of his drawings in chalk. When we actually got out there however, I got lost in a haze of artistic anxiety and indecision. I simply could not settle on anything. Every line was hesitant, my spatial distortions were completely off and I had almost forgotten that it could be due to coming up on mushrooms, since I was not actually getting any other changes in perception. I would second guess myself, and then judge each single line like a monument to some huge personal failure. We were listening to The Fiery Furnaces, which made my mind jump around frantically. There was a lyric which haunted me: I thought I was thinking, but apparently not. I kept lingering on that line. How can such a contradiction exist? It felt like I had forgotten how to think.     I told V. that we should go in, and she agreed. She was not getting good work done due to similar mental circumstances. Inside, I started to realize that I was might face something really big, and I wanted to have a full stomach so that the mushrooms alone werent the only thing in my stomach. I prepared a sandwich, took one bite, and couldnt take another. I wanted to drink something, but all the cups were dirty. We decided to try to watch a movie, and within 10 seconds I realized I would be unable to follow it. I put on a blanket because I was cold, then I realized I was hot. All of this was adding up to a state of nervous contradiction and negation.     I started to become just really irritated, and borderline angry. I decided I should just try to sleep, so I threw off my clothes, and took out my contacts which were itching badly. I tried to induce vomiting because I felt sick, but couldnt. I told V. to find and put on Godspeed You! Black Emperor, but she was unable to find the CD. (Later on I realized this might have been a subconscious desire to have an appropriate soundtrack for the end of the world)    At this point, my thoughts were racing: Want To Draw, But feel blocked. Want to eat, but not hungry. Want to drink, but no clean cups. Want to watch a movie, but cant follow it. Feel like vomiting, but cant. Want to listen to Godspeed, but cant find it. Got ready for sleep, but cant because Im losing my fucking mind.  I am in bed with my face into the pillow, pulling my hair. V. Comes in and lies next to me.     Me: This is awful.  V: I know.  Me: I need to forget all of this. (I start to cry)   V: We poisoned ourselves, we just need to sleep, and when we wake up, itll be like nothing ever happened.     She goes to clean a cup, so I can have a drink of water. With my eyes closed, I see what I can only describe as a slot machine, infinitely long and tall, that adjusts in perspective according to my heads actual position. On the face of each is a picture of myself in a different emotion or physical state. Whichever picture is located in the center of my range of vision is the emotion I feel fully, but the slot machine is cycling at such an alarming rate that I am feeling what I estimate to be 10 emotions every second. My facial muscles work to accommodate each emotion, and I essentially lose control of my face. I feel extreme pain, followed by extreme euphoria for a millisecond each. I feel, essentially, everything at once. Finally, the slot machine rests on a single face: Madness. It is a picture of myself in green, clawing at my eyes. I realize what is going to happen: When the machine adds the sum total of all Ive been, I will be defined, and I will die.       Some scientists speculate that since the universe exploded from an infinitely powerful singularity, the gravitational field may one day become too weak to sustain this expansion, and the universe will start to gravitate inwards, and collide into another singularity, possibly to restart the entire process anew. I see every human consciousness as analogous to the big bang. Throughout our experience as humans, we become more and more complex and organized from our embryonic states, to the point that we grow up and start integrating concepts into patterns of thought, behavior, emotion, just as the universe organized into clusters of planets and stars, comets, black holes, etc., As I am running from the bedroom to the living room to find V., all the concepts and truths I accept, regarding nature, matter, humanity, sociology, biology, philosophy, art, start to rapidly compute into analogies, which physically connect to one another.     Everything subjective, everything regarding the self (my emotions, dreams, etc.,) become the earth, and all my perceptions regarding the external world are the stars. And the entire universe is folding in on itself, and I am simply not ready for whatever happens after it.  I feel like I will have completed life, solved the puzzle. It was as if I have seen every part, or almost every part, through my observations, and how they fit together, so I was worthy to view the gestalt, the whole form, one singularity. And I thought: No one would be allowed back from seeing that, because you must be outside of that form in order to view it. I thought of what V. said, It would be like nothing ever happened. I thought I would die, for sure, but I also thought I might be reincarnated, (maybe due to her statement when you wake up) or simply exhiled somewhere away from this world that I know and love. I didnt think a living person is allowed to see whats on the other side of the end of the universe.    Near this time in my life, I was extremely immersed in Ayn Rands novels, and objectivism as a practical philosophy. For those that dont know, her philosophy revolves around the love of the ego, and the virtue of selfishness, (or at least rational self interest). Being an artist, the Fountainhead greatly influenced my drive to work hard at learning my craft, rather than just sit around and wait for inspiration. However, worshiping my ego, and reveling in the separation between me and my environment will not allow me to sit complacently as it dissolves. I mistook my ego for my actual life, which I believe was not actually at risk.     I tell her: I am going to die. Call 911, right now. She refuses on the grounds that I am just having a bad trip, so I run to my neighbors apartment right across the hall. I am frantically trying to get them to call, but they demand to know the situation, and I dont think I can even take the time to explain without dying first. I feel like I am being tested. If I am able to go out, into the world, in my underwear, at the risk of public humiliation, legal trouble, hospital bills, potentially losing my job, (I worked in a movie theater, located in the outdoor mall area right next to my apartment complex), having my parents and the world see me for what I was, exposed and scared and on drugs, then I would have earned my right to live.     As I attempt to run out of the building, V. and a neighbor attempt to stop me. The neighbor is about twice my size, and both of them are grabbing me as hard as they can. I am pulling on the door frame with all my might. I feel their hands as a thousand corpses hands, trying to hold me into my coffin. Gradually they let go, and I fly head first off the concrete steps, flat on my face, fracturing my nasal bone, bloodying my face. I dont even register the pain, it feels like I just fell through a huge number of patterned-walls.     I take off running as fast as Ive ever run. I dont have contacts or glasses on, and since I am legally blind without correction, I can barely discern forms from blurry blocks of color. The sun is setting, and I run towards the exit of the apartment complex. I get a car to stop, and tell the driver, as calmly as I can under the circumstances, that I have poisoned myself with mushrooms and need help. He says Nah man I got kids in here. I look and do not see kids. I assume that he was basically the universes analogy for this cokehead idiot I know, who inexplicably always wanted to hang out, even though I made it consistently clear how little I respected him. I always made these half-assed, transparent excuses not to hang out, and now there was some universal equity.     Next, I turn towards my place of employment. I get to the back of the building, and successfully stop a car, with a man driving and a woman in the passengers seat. I try to the best of my ability to explain to them that I am going to die, and I jump into the back of their car and demand that they take me to the hospital. The guy gets out, comes to me, and starts hitting my legs and trying to pull me out of the car. He is yelling: \'Get the fuck out!\' I associate the door he is trying to drag me out of with death, and so the opposite door, the passengers side, must be my chance at life. I scramble across the seats, onto the womans lap, and then out her door. I run as fast as I can into the parking lot. My brain is in a whirl, and I figure out that the Security Guard for the theater, who shall be referred to as X., can help me.  Ive known him for several years and I figure he would understand I was on drugs and needed help, and I trusted him. At this point he represented the concepts of security and life, a trusted friend and rational problem solver.     Once an hour, he will take a walk around the building on patrol, so I start to scream for X., but he is not outside. I get to the intersection that is formed by the street the movie theater is at, and another perpendicular street. For some reason, probably a sense of embarrassment, I decide to take the perpendicular street. I love my job, and I was glad to be able to keep it after this incident, but if I had simply obeyed the rules of the game, clearly internally defined at the outset, I wouldnt have faced the trouble I am about to explain to you.     As soon as I reach the other side, I am standing outside an ice cream store. There are probably close to 20 people eating outside, and loitering around. I cannot see, so everybody there appears as faceless, non-specific people. I ask them all to help, and everyone keeps turning away from me. Looking back and realizing how scared people must have been, I understand, but still wish someone had acknowledged me. In this entire experience, all that it would have taken was one single person assuring me: Calm down, Im going to call 911 right now.      So to try and get some attention for my cause, I attempt to run full speed into the glass door, with my head, to shatter it. I had passed up my work, and without any real direction now, I was confused and grasping for straws. I smash into the glass, fall backwards, hear a scream\x85    Apparently I blacked out, got up, and ran another 2 blocks, because thats where my next memory starts. Im staring diagonally into the intersection in front of the shopping center. On one side is a security guard employed by the shopping center, and on the other, a police officer. I think to myself that I can turn myself over to the security guard, but since its not X., I dont want to settle. And I could turn myself over to the cops, but I have a problem with authority, and he may take me straight to jail instead of the hospital. So, I decide to take my chances by running between them, into the intersection\x85 I dont know what I was thinking at this point, because I seemed to forget my original intention of getting help, and almost be putting myself into the way of death.     I think perhaps this experience was a call-back to another mushrooms trip I had, where me and V. took a walk in the city at sunset, and life unfolded as a perfectly-created game, where everything we saw was conceptualized and represented conceptual trends, rather than just isolated events. We almost followed a group of people into a crosswalk on a Dont Walk sign. The first people in the group almost got hit, and returned back to the side they came from. I look at V., and say That represents group-think, and group-mistake. I saw the intersection as a microcosm for life, and I think this time I was submitting myself to the mercy of life, to chance. Or maybe it was just because the whole event felt like the last 5 minutes of a movie, and I needed a climax worthy of what preceded it. Or maybe I was just confused and crazy, with a serious head injury. Most likely, it was a combination of all 3.     The cop grabs my arm, and I yank it away from him. As I approach the geometrical center of the intersection, a millisecond-timer hits 0:00:00, and then it starts into a positive counter. That number, later, I think represented what could have been a timer for the end of my life, and when I got there, there was a coin-flip to see if I lived or died. I get to the other side of the intersection and I feel my muscles lock up, and see everything fading to black\x85    When I come to, I am in an ambulance. I am told that I was tazed by the cop as soon as I got to the other side of the intersection. At the hospital, I am diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage, a fractured nasal bone, a bruised rib, and tons of lacerations all over my feet and body. For 2 days I am in the ICU, and spend another 4 altogether. They were extremely close to having to drill into my head to relieve the pressure, but thankfully they never did, and I survive without any enduring injuries.     My stepdads military insurance thankfully covers the medical bills, so I have no expenses besides the court costs. I get $700 in fees, 2 years probation, and 5 years where any alcohol or drug charges will cost me 7 months in jail. And as I leave the courtroom I feel such an immense happiness and love for all things. I am extremely fortunate for the way everything turned out. I feel like Dostoevsky, facing the firing squad, only to be pardoned at the very last second. This event gave him inspiration, (most of his books reflect this theme of near-death experience), and it also gave him the drive to finish some of his greatest novels, being completely aware of the fact that he would one day die. This event has effected me in very much the same way. This will be one of the most defining moments in my life, and one I will revisit often in art.    During the first month or so after this experience, I had very little recollection of what it was that had caused this madness, and I was sure that I would never, ever take psychedelics again. My mind blocked out a number of details that slowly, little by little, came back to me. It seemed like everything that had happened in the peak of the trip was too much for my brain to comprehend, and so it buried them under waves of mental noise. When, almost 3 months after the experience, I had decoded the last of the information, I started to realize that the trip is concurrent with a lot of Buddhist ideals, and with the concept of ego-death in general. It was not, as I first assumed, that I had seen something as meaningless as a giant refrigerator monster chasing me down, trying to eat me. I had viewed the truth at the end of all things: Everything is one. As Phil Elverum sings: The world is in me, and I am in the world. Altogether, it was not the trip that was bad, it was my attitude towards it, it was the worship of ego I had adopted. I consider it a failing of myself, and not of psilocybin, which truly caused this experience.     I have been researching Terence Mckenna recently, and although Im too much of a rationalist to agree with all things hes said, it would appear based on my experience, that psilocybin lets me contact something which is pure information.  I like to call this thing the Logos, (My definition lies somewhere between McKennas and Aristotles). It is the entire logic and balance of the universe, the thing which binds matter together, and also the process of organization into hierarchies. The Logos, at least, has complete knowledge of the individual which is communicating with it, perhaps of the entire history of genetic information, and even moreso, perhaps even over the entire history of the universe and beyond. In the future, we will master these realms, to apply engineering and science to these inner worlds, which are truly the most mysterious thing we are capable of currently exploring, (probably more so than the local areas of space which we can explore while still dependant on combustible fuel).     Will I ever do psychedelics again? Yes, and I do not answer this question lightly. I genuinely feel, as someone receptive to these experiences, (I usually trip roughly twice as hard as everyone I know under equivalent doses), and as someone with a rational, adventurous mind, I have almost an obligation to the future of mankind to report, through my art, those truths behind this world that we know. I am taking a 5-year break, (enough to wear off that suspended jail-sentence), but after that, I eagerly await the worlds to find on the other side of ego-death."
