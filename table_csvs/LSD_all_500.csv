77890,Retrospective: The Memorable Moments,Mujo Lila,"Dec 9, 2010",H.B. Woodrose & Various,"This is a record of my experiences with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. I am a 23 year old male, about 150 lbs, tall thin body type. My Hawaiian Baby Woodrose experiences include several combinations and take place over the course of 4 years. In the interest of time, I am reducing these experiences to their most memorable components. Beyond the HBWR accounts below, I have had, over the course of the past three years, about 30 experiences with lsd, half that number with mushrooms, and a handful of trials with 2c-b, 2c-e, 4-aco-dmt, 5-meo-mipt, mdma, salvia, and so on (god bless you, private college). I am on no prescribed medication, but perform yoga and smoke marijuana regularly.     All of these LSA extractions were performed in the same way: I grind up the seeds in a coffee grinder, soak them in tap water or tonic water for about 2-4 hours (or until water turns brown), then filter out the seed material through a t-shirt repeatedly (until water lightens to green) and drink the water without sediment. Although I\'m curious to try different methods, the other HBWR experiences in the vaults take away the appeal of the alternatives.     Experience 1:     My dose: Approx 8-10 seeds    Extracted with water. Taken with two friends who supplemented their doses with small (< 2 gram) doses of mushrooms. The three of us went to a bonfire by the forest edge with another group of friends. Come up was long and surprisingly silent; I felt nothing until over two hours into the trip at which point I felt a sudden rush of confidence, energy, and happiness. Another tripping friend and I anthropomorphosized rolls of toilet paper, pretending they were our children. At the time, this was very uncharacteristic of my behavior. Social inhibitions dropped a significant degree, I still had my clothes on but I had no problem having a toilet paper war in the lobby of my dorm building. Visuals were mild: at one point, a friend standing by a bonfire and playing a prank on drunken freshmen took on the appearance of a malicious jester in the flickering shadows. Other than that, I noticed nothing outside of lights appearing brighter than normal. As the trip intensified, I felt less inclined to be outside among a crowd of people, and headed back to my dorm. The other two joined me shortly afterwards.     Attempting to write my thoughts down was pointless. The best I could do were strange, pretentious phrases like the hydra-headed mask of the ego written without any supplementary information or even using complete sentences. Eating fruit was exceptionally enjoyable, and while I was incoherent on paper, I was capable of holding long and interesting conversations with my two fellow trippers. We all noted that we could listen and speak more or less simultaneously without missing either half of our conversations. We were also able to open up emotionally to each other with ease. The three of us had not known each other well at the time, and were naturally introverted anyway, so the empathy was remarkable to me. The peak hit at about this time (much later than a mushroom or lsd peak), accompanied with the weird sensation that things in the center of my visual field were getting closer without actually moving. Pot had minimal effect on the trip that I could see, and the comedown was not particularly notable.    Experience 2:    My dose: Approx 8-10 seeds    Extracted with water, over night. I took the same amount of seeds as I had the last time, so I was surprised by the underwhelming effects. I chalk the weakness in potency up to the over night filtration, since subsequent extractions of shorter duration have all yielded effective doses from similar seeds. Difference in alkaloid concentration within the batch of seeds is also possible. About 8-10 seeds, taken with a friend (D) new to tripping at the time. Neither of us noticed anything until smoking a joint outside in the snow, at which point I felt heavily sedated with very mild open eye visuals (unnaturally rippling blanket on wall) while my friend experienced impressive synaesthetic CEVs. He seemed to be off in his own world, and would change subjects in mid-conversation without stopping to explain the connection between the current topic and the previous one. We both felt it necessary to spend the next several hours comfortably beneath blankets.     Experience 3:    My dose: Approx 8-10 seeds, one hit of moderately strong blotter acid    Seeds were crushed and extracted in water for three hours. I was with two friends who took approx. the same dose that I did, and we all drank our seeds about thirty minutes before eating the tabs of acid. As we began to come up, we went to see another friend perform at the campus theater. I had intense open-eye visuals before the show: the dusty footprints tracked on the stage began bounding off of the ground and into the air in looping ribbons. I felt comfortable in my seat, and didn\'t feel restless during the show or nervous in the company of so many strangers. As I usually feel/behave awkwardly in social settings when on acid, feeling reasonably calm in public was a nice change.     I enjoyed the play, and afterwards, my tripping friends and I went to a zen garden on campus and sat by the tiny pond inside it, smoking a bowl. I noticed that my friends seemed to have an easier time conversing than I did, but they have had a lot more experience tripping than I\'ve had. They were talking about whether or not beauty was something biologically programmed into our brains. I could think of nothing to say and instead watched the strange visuals play out across the landscape. A nearby building began to groove and sway to music I must\'ve been imagining, vibrating warm purple/magenta/orange waves. Looking at the pond, I see the plants by the edge growing continuously larger and yet never actually moving an inch, a weird visual paradox. It reminded me of the sensation of perpetual approach I felt when staring at objects during the peak my first HBWR trip.     The trip began to mellow out considerably after the four hour mark, but the acid kept us awake for the entire night (my least favorite thing about acid... just too damn long..). I still felt unable to communicate verbally some 7 hours after dosing, and decided instead to take some of my notebook doodlings and bring them up a notch. While drawing under the influence, I was able to visualize and project my thoughts onto the page as I drew. This is something that happens frequently to me on lsd, even lower doses. This was the first time I noticed that effect, however, and was very pleased with the results, even if completely exhausted by that time.     Experience 4:    My dose: approx 8-10 HBWR seeds and about \xbe gram of mushrooms    I was with a friend who was new to HBWR seeds but no stranger to mushrooms. He assured me they were potent, and that we wouldn\'t need many. We did the extraction in tonic water this time, at a friend\'s suggestion, and let it sit for about an hour. After drinking our extraction, we waited for the gastrointestinal weight to subside and then ate a few small mushrooms each from the bag. We went for a walk, waiting for the effects to come on. We ended up in a nearby park, and played on the swingsets a bit until my friend threw up from the combined nauseas of swinging, shrooming, and seeding. I noticed gentle patterns of colored light sweeping across the playground, and felt a very nice synergy beginning between the two substances. I felt very calm and at home under the stars in that field... But suddenly I felt a strong desire to be in the nearby forest. My friend and I wandered in, and sat in the dark in the roots of the trees and enjoyed some closed eye visuals.     After grooving on that for a while, and laughing incoherently about this and that, we wandered back out into the field, lay on our backs, and watched the stars. It felt like the longer we looked the deeper we could go and the more we could see. I should\'ve stayed there for another hour or more, but instead I decided to go back home and listen to music. In retrospect, it seemed like a deliberate attempt to steer a trip that did not want to be steered. On the way back, I tried to explain some weird thoughts on the nature of consciousness that I was having to my friend, but I couldn\'t make any sense out of them at the time. I ended up frustrated, and did not enjoy any of the music we listened to and had trouble drawing. I finally retreated to my bedroom to listen to the music in my head and relax. My mistake was trying to control the trip with a familiar setting in a familiar room with familiar music, when the psychedelics were urging me to explore outside.     Although I did not enjoy that trip as much as I could have, I think a higher dosage of mushrooms and a better mindset might have made for a more productive evening. However the best synergy I encountered came from the next trip:    Experience 5:     My dose: approx 10 HBWR seeds and 15 mg of 4-HO-DiPT    My friend and I, taking equal doses, took the seed extract first and followed with the 4-HO-DiPT about 45 minutes later. We began feeling a lot of spastic leg tension (like being possessed by MC Hammer), probably due to the tryptamine analogue, and decided we ought to get up and wander around. We both felt very giggly and self confident, much like a roll. We wandered over to an apartment where some friends lived and proceeded to smoke a lot of pot with them. Many of these people I normally felt very self-conscious around, but in that state I felt totally comfortable making small talk. After hanging with that group for a while, I went upstairs to visit two other friends of mine, who were discussing their dreams. Again, I typically felt intimidated by these friends, but after listening to them describe their dreams to me and telling them about mine, I\'ve yet to feel anxious around them again.     I met up with my fellow tripper again, and, about 3.5 hours after dosing, we found ourselves coming down in an all night diner with chocolate milkshakes.    Wow... did you feel that?    I did.    That was the first thought I\'ve had in three hours.    Yeah, same here, and it was true, I had had no internal dialogue whatsoever for most of the night. I had very slight visuals and no mind expansion, but a really wonderful sense of empathy and comfort. I would have loved to experiment more with 4-HO-DiPT, but our source sold out quickly, and understandably so.     Experiment 6:    My dose: 14 HBWR seeds    Using tonic water, we extracted our seeds for 2 hours. My friends (D and L) took ten seeds each and I took fourteen. I felt nauseous shortly after ingestion, and laid down for the next hour or so. One of my friends (D) felt nauseous as well, and threw up after an hour. He throws up at the beginning of most of his trips, but this was the first time I had ever gotten ill from ingesting the HBWR seeds. After that first hour, we both felt fine, although I had no desire to exert myself in any way for the duration of the trip.     About two and a half hours of sitting around and giggling later, my tripping partners and I noticed enhanced visual acuity. The fuzz in the carpet and wood grain on the doors and windowsills appeared exceptionally interesting. Stretching felt incredible, as did rolling on the carpet. This was the first time I had noticed an entactogenic quality to LSA. D and I had no problem communicating, but L, new to HBWR, seemed anxious and quiet. I suggested we watch nature documentaries, and he reported reduced anxiety shortly thereafter. He remarked that our inactivity had made him anxious, which I thought interesting given that I had felt compelled to be as inactive as possible.     Four and a half hours after dosing, we all gave into our laziness as deeply and utterly as possible. We agreed in retrospect that this was probably the peak, and it felt very late in the trip for a peak to me. I put on some emotive guitar rock (Explosions In The Sky) and we covered ourselves in blankets and got as comfortable as possible on the floor. I noticed subtle synaesthesia thoughts with the music, hearing it as shimmering blue and magenta. I felt a strong but pleasant pressure on my sacrum and meditated on that spot for a while. Near the end of the album I noticed a new pressure at the crown of my head and experienced a brief but sharp memory recall (too personal to describe, but a special enough moment for me to be grateful), texture, smell, flavor.     L and I both noted later that we had felt perpetually ready to doze off for almost an hour without ever actually falling asleep. This was very comfortable, more like meditation than insomnia. D felt comfortable enough to drive home about seven hours after dosing, but L and I continued to feel the effects until about nine hours after the dose. I felt very much at peace with the world even into the next day.     Summary:    My experiences have been spiritually soothing and empathic at best, confusing and uninteresting at worst. Using the simple extraction described above, I\'ve never become sick enough to vomit even when mixing LSA with other substances. Given the contrast between the most consistent primary effects I\'ve noticed  calm euphoria, confident mindset, enhanced vision and taste  and the wide range of effects I\'ve noticed browsing the internet, I wonder if there are other plant alkaloids within the seeds that may not be water soluble. I also wonder if this extracation method is sloppy and not getting the most amount of LSA possible from the seeds.    Although mild in comparison to the majority of my psychedelic experience, I have still enjoyed my LSA experiences and am grateful to have had them."
75871,Clarity & Cubism,Sofiowka,"Mar 20, 2009","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Tobacco","It was late into the first semester of my freshman year of college. Due to some problems, I had screwed up my semester and had to drop most of my classes to save my GPA and my scholarship, so I was only taking one class, and it was an art class. Now, this is a small liberal arts school in just about the middle of nowhere, and I don\'t have a car, so there\'s just about nothing to do. I always find something to do, but there\'s nothing to do. If I find myself in a situation where I\'m not busy, getting high starts to look like the only thing to do.    Contemplating dinner, a friend, F, and I decided it was a good time to smoke some weed. We\'d been smoking a lot on our friend J\'s vaporizer, which had the advantage of being really efficient and being indoors, and although we were more in the mood to smoke with something else, it was damn cold outside, so we went to his room. When we got there, J was on his way out with Z, another friend, but they were happy to smoke some more with us. As we sat down, J told us that they had just taken woodrose seeds. Z had taken three -- a low dose, because he has a history of schizophrenia and didn\'t want to trigger anything -- and J had taken six. They\'d taken them a bit before we got there, at around 6:00. And they had more. J had a bunch of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and me and F bought ten from him, then had a nice session on the vaporizer. Once we were high we went to dinner and planned out our night. We were going to read up about LSA online for a while, go to the studio hours for the art class we were both in, stay until 10:00, then eat the seeds. It was a Thursday night, which meant the start of the weekend, because neither of us had any classes on Fridays. As time wore on we became disenchanted with the idea of going to studio at all, so we decided not to bother and took the seeds at 8:30.    When we bought the seeds, J had explained to us a little about them. He said that the light brown stuff on the outside of them was poison, and that we should scrape it off before eating them, and he said that when we ate them we should just pop them in our mouths and chew them up. He told us they would take about an hour to kick in, and that we would probably throw up when they did, and then the trip would start. He also said we\'d be more comfortable in baggy clothes, but I ignored that. I was wearing tights, a short skirt, and this tight sweater made of a material that feels kind of strange on my skin, but interesting. I loved that outfit, I didn\'t want to change it. After we scraped the poison off, we decided not to chew them up after all. It seemed like it would work a lot better if we ground them up and then ate the power, so we stuck them in F\'s coffee grinder. We ate five seeds each -- I put mine on a chunk of chocolate, but a lot of it fell off and I had to pick it up off my skirt and scarf, and it was kind of unpleasant to eat the whole chunk of chocolate at once.    After eating them, we went up to the Student Union to wait. I chilled on a couch in the formal lounge and talked to a few friends about the trip I was about to have. After about half an hour there, I started to get a really wonderful sensation. Mentally I felt entirely normal, but physically, I was in ecstasy. Everything felt good, incredibly good. Every movement was intense pleasure, and so was sitting still. And the pleasure kept increasing. I was lying on a couch talking to a guy who started scratching my leg through my tights. It felt incredible, almost overwhelmingly so. It seemed conceivable that I could actually have an orgasm just from that if it went on long enough.    At some point F came into the room, and she was feeling the same was I was. She\'s done E a few times, and she said she felt like she was on it again. I walked around the building a bit, touching walls -- everything felt different than it usually does, and it all felt really, really good. Just about any physical sensation I felt was a semi-sexual, or in some cases entirely sexual, pleasure. I wondered whether if I felt pain, it would be a heightened experience of pain, or if it would be pleasure, too. I mentioned this and F pinched me on the leg with her fingernails. I said, \'Ow, fuck. I don\'t like that.... oh, wait, I REALLY like that!\' Which is my normal reaction to being pinched, except that it felt a little bit more intense. A friend of mine, watching my behavior and how I was talking, told me there were definitely mental effects even if I didn\'t think I was feeling different mentally. I knew what he was talking about, though, and I knew that the way I was acting was only indirectly caused by the LSA. The direct cause was the pleasure.    At some point, we tried to eat, but found it incredibly difficult. It wasn\'t that I wasn\'t hungry, because I was quite hungry. It was just that picking the food up, putting it into my mouth, chewing, swallowing... it was an incredibly, incredibly deliberate process, and it wasn\'t easy to do. I eventually gave up entirely, because it wasn\'t rewarding.    F and I decided it was time to go outside, go somewhere else. I wanted to feel the air and touch different things and walk. I also wanted a cigarette. We took the elevator down to the basement where we ran into J. He said Z was upstairs getting food, and then went with us. On the way, I noticed that I wasn\'t aware of \'myself\' in terms of the context and details of my life. Things like my name, what classes I was taking, my life story were completely away from my consciousness. I couldn\'t remember them off the top of my head, but I didn\'t care. I was pretty sure that if I thought about it, I\'d be able to remember. It was freeing. I felt innocent, and like a child in my lack of backstory and context.    Somewhere in between the Student Union and the smoking area behind the Lecture Center, F wasn\'t around anymore. I don\'t quite remember where she went or why, but I was definitely sitting and smoking alone with J for a while. Or, I think we were smoking. I know I didn\'t have any cigarettes -- I may have gone up to my room first and grabbed one of the stale cigarettes I like to save for emergencies. I must have gone to my room, because I was sick of the clothes I was wearing. I changed into black leggings and a tight blue t-shirt when I was up there. It was the best thing I\'d ever put on. I felt empowered. It occurred to me that it might be too cold for that getup, but it felt really, really good, and I had the feeling that the cold wouldn\'t bother me, which it didn\'t. I think we talked about what we were experiencing, but I don\'t remember clearly.     At some point, F was around again, and we all decided we needed to go find Z, because it didn\'t seem good to leave him alone. We went back up to the SU, and he wasn\'t there anymore. It seems like we must have checked his room, but I don\'t remember doing that. Since we\'d by then been to all of the normal places he might be (it\'s a small, small campus), I suggested we take a walk around the lake, because there\'s a bridge there that Z likes to go to to think and be and smoke and write. And even if he wasn\'t there, it was a damn gorgeous walk.    We walked, and I felt very, very happy. I had the sense that we were all on the same level, and I was really happy we were around each other and not people who were on a different level. I was glad we\'d left all the sober people in the Student Union, I knew I would be getting a really bad vibe if I were still up there. When we got most of the way to the bridge, we could see that Z wasn\'t there, and J wanted to go back the way we came to look for him elsewhere. F really, really wanted to go the rest of the way around the lake. I was torn -- I wanted to find Z and see how he was doing, but I also really wanted to do the full lake walk. I decided to stay with F, thinking that she and I were going to be on the same wavelength all night, so we should stay together. J took off back where we came from, and me and F went to the bridge.    Someone once told me that when doing the walk around the lake, you have to stop at the bridge and have a conversation. I liked that idea a lot, so I\'ve always stuck to it, and made sure everyone I walked with did, too. So tonight, too, we stopped there. The lake was mostly frozen and the water was rushing under the bridge loudly. Eventually we sat with our legs hanging over the edge and just looked at the water (the water was incredible, but I can\'t remember why), and the trees beyond it, and the lights beyond the trees, and all the buildings and places we knew laid out in front of us. I was so happy to live there, to go to this school, to exist somewhere so beautiful. The landscape was beautiful, but more than that, the people we knew were beautiful. We talked about them, how everyone was so interesting, so unique, so pretty, like something out of a story. And our lives, too, were story-like, and wonderful. I wanted to go see if Z had been located, so we got up. As we finished the lake walk, I looked at the frozen edge of it.     \'It\'s incredible, when things are frozen like this,\' one of us said.     F said, \'It\'s so still.\'    \'It feels magical. I think... I think that it is special, when water is frozen like this, because to us water is such an inexorable force. It can\'t be stopped... it is as inexorable as time. They are the same kinds of forces, to us. To see water frozen still is like seeing time frozen.\' I remember saying that very, very clearly.    Emerging from the lake area, marveling at our surroundings, the lights were so bright, things still seemed still. I think we intended to go to Dolliver, the boys\' dorm, but approaching the dining hall, we saw the chime tree. There\'s a big old tree outside of the dining hall with lots of wind chimes hung from it -- over ten I bet -- that\'s pretty easy to climb up into. I got up onto the lowest branch, a really wide branch, comfortable for sitting on. F didn\'t try to get into the tree at all, she sat and stood in some different places at the bottom. Climbing into the tree was easier than it usually is these days. It felt natural, easy; I didn\'t have to strategize or try intellectually to figure out how to get up. I just did it, like when I was a kid and climbing trees was one of the most important things in life. This sparked a long conversation, but I don\'t remember who said what, exactly. It\'s not important who said what, though -- what I remember is the whole of what came from both of us.    \'When you\'re a kid, you totally get it, about trees. You know exactly how to climb them, and it\'s easy. And if you tell another kid about a tree, they know what you\'re talking about. They get what it means to find a good tree. Kids just know what trees mean. I remember what it\'s like to know, but now that I\'m older I don\'t really know anymore. I think I know right now. I feel like a kid again in a lot of ways. Light, free. We are free. The world is light. We were right when we were kids, when we were always outside, when it didn\'t matter how cold it was, when things were so cool, when fantasy was no less important than reality. I feel that way now. Being a kid, it\'s just like tripping all the time. Or tripping is like being a kid.    I think-- I think it\'s a glimpse of what the ultimate reality is. Of the after-- or, no, of... of the time between death and birth. And the experience of life is the comedown from that. From the ultimate trip, kind of. As a child you\'re closest to the trip. You\'re just off-peak. And all of life is coming down, getting farther away from it, and eventually, when the comedown ends, that\'s when the trip starts again. And stuff like this, it\'s a way of seeing what the other part of experience is. And we need it, to try to understand what\'s happening to us. It\'s a re-enactment of the life cycle of the universe, it\'s a form of worship. And sex, and weed, they\'re smaller forms. Tripping, you can\'t do that a lot, because that\'s abuse, that\'s not -- you have to experience what this life is, it\'s part of everything, the whole experience. Weed, you can do that more, it\'s not a complete removal from this experience, it just makes it easier, and that\'s okay.\'    This revelation came with great excitement. I could barely contain myself, I was so excited, so happy. It was incredible. We wanted to go tell the boys, so we went to Dolliver, and they were there, in the lounge. But when we got in there, it was a huge bummer. The room seemed awful, empty. Spaces in it seemed so large and soulless, the lights were all wrong. I sat with Z and F sat somewhere, and we told them what we\'d figured out. They seemed to get it, but not really. They talked about what they\'d been up to, which was basically coming down, but I didn\'t like the way they talked about it. It seemed wrong. We left, and F agreed with me that those two were a major bummer. I was starting to get cold, and I wanted to be dressed more warmly, so we went into our building, to our respective rooms.     When I got up to my room, I put on some really loose, warm clothes, and put some music on. I think it was Radiohead, but whatever it was, it was terrible. Everything was terrible. Not in an overwhelming, specific way -- everything just sucked. And it was scary, kind of. Not terrifying, but unnerving. I was extremely uncomfortable. I grabbed what weed I had left and went down to F\'s room. She was having a crappy time, too. We adjusted the lights in her room a few times, but everything still seemed wrong, off. The proportions of the room seemed abnormal and bad, the shape of everything was unpleasant. For a while I spaced out at her desk, in my own little world of emotional discomfort, and then I told her, \'Okay... we can fix this. I have an idea. Let\'s smoke some weed.\' She was enthused about this idea, so we decided to go up to the Gazebo -- a cigarette smoking area where, late at night (because it was around 3 AM by now), you\'re pretty safe from security, because it\'s right on the edge of lower campus, but you don\'t have to go out into the woods, and there\'s enough light to see, and you can sit down -- and stop off at the SU first to see if there was anyone there who would make us feel comfortable.    I was pretty sure I didn\'t want to see most people. I didn\'t think I could handle them. A lot of the people I usually hang out with in the Student Union are pretty straight edge, or at least dismissive of drug experiences, and they would be really harsh on us in the state we were in. And we talked to some of them for a few minutes, and it was just how I thought. And the rooms, the rooms felt terrible. We needed something to smoke from, so I grabbed a Red Bull can from the recycling and we crushed it in the middle, found a push pin and a pen, and did our thing with them. I\'d never used a can of that shape and size and composition before, and it had a funny kind of feel to it, unusually angular.    We headed up to the gazebo, and when we got there we ran into some friends who we had sort of interesting relationships to. We weren\'t digging their vibe very much but we shared some weed with them anyway, and they gave us a couple of American Spirits. I smoked one right away and we saved the other for later. I think we told them we were tripping and told them a bit of what we\'d been experiencing, and eventually they took off, which was a relief. We smoked more and more weed. We smoked a lot of weed -- I don\'t know how much, exactly. I had maybe half of a 20 bag, F had probably about a 20 bag\'s worth, but I don\'t remember how that weed had been priced. We smoked a little over half of what I had and maybe about half of what she had. I was taking incredible hits, and sometimes hit after hit after hit without any air. I couldn\'t get enough of it. In between heaps of weed, we smoked the cigarette. It was the best cigarette of my life. It was delicious, so delicious, and I was taking big pulls and holding them in. I didn\'t want to let it go, because there was so little. F was enjoying it as much as I was. It was a glorious, wondrous cigarette. It was hard to deal with the prospect of not having it anymore, of there being no way to get another. We smoked some of the filter, but didn\'t care. \'THAT is what is going to give me cancer. Right there.\'     We worked cigarettes into our earlier revelation, saw them as a way to deal with this great comedown, a way to get by, a little boost. We talked more about the idea, too, about how cigarettes are killing you. \'That\'s a part of why they feel so good. It\'s bringing you closer.\' F questioned whether that was \'cheating\' and I said that it wasn\'t, because it\'s not about dying, it\'s about feeling good. She brought up a statistic about how many teens become addicted to cigarettes every year, and said that it would be amazing if all of those people were brought into one place, how many love affairs would spark over a cigarette, how incredible and interesting it would be. And that it should last for only two and a half weeks -- long enough to get to know people, to form attachments, to start to care, to get comfortable, but not long enough for anything to wear off, to get old, to end on its own. It would happen, and then it would end, bittersweet, it would be only what it was. After the cigarette, we heaped a bunch more weed on the can.    After a while, every time I would take a hit of weed I would completely lose all grip on reality for a few moments. I sometimes wouldn\'t be able to see anything, but I\'d have strange visual experiences. Once, all I could see was this very industrial-seeming pattern of rectangles. At other times I could see, but things were extremely distorted. I saw a lot of weird stuff when looking at my friend. I saw a fragment of her face reflected as if in a strange mirror onto another part of her face. I thought for a few seconds that she looked like an old Native American man, and even after she turned and broke the illusion, it was hard to shake the impression for a little while. I tried to explain to her what I was seeing, but I couldn\'t convey it. What did seem to make sense to her, though, was when I tried to explain about the can. The can, you see, it was both a Cubist representation of the can, and a sort of realization, a physical representation of the idea of Cubism. This seemed very strange -- I never had any particular interest in Cubism, had never looked at much of it -- but also quite natural. It was extremely significant and important, but in an abstract, large, indescribable way.    I was a little bit paranoid about security, because they were doing their rounds and driving up, and I didn\'t want to have to deal with them. It wasn\'t the consequences of getting caught that I was worried about, in the moment, it was that we would have to deal with them. We\'d have to sit in their little shack and have interactions with them, try to \'explain\', they\'d never let us relax. It would have been a serious bummer. They never came, but I was always very alert when a car moved. A car turned on and odd but beautiful music echoed through the night. The car pulled out of its space and moved into another space a few feet away, making crazy shadows with its headlights on the big flat wall of the Student Union. It was an incredible moment, we were both struck by it. We watched the cleaning people (one of whom always seems a bit like a mythical creature) walking into the building, and over the distance and through the lights and past the different three-dimensional protrusions, it looked like they were in a separate world.     It wasn\'t a purely visual experience up there, however. I was now very aware of my life and circumstances, but disconnected from them. I felt that I had an outsider\'s perspective on my life, I could see myself as an objective other would see me rather than from behind all of my emotions and confusion and thought patterns and strange ideas. Thinking about my life, I saw that I was living out a beautiful story, that everything that I was doing in my life was very pretty. Even things that I thought were un-pretty, inelegant, unrewarding experiences were actually just as wonderful as everything else, just as valuable, just as much fascinating stories. I felt extremely lucky to be living this life, such a wonderful life, but at the same time, I couldn\'t imagine any life that wouldn\'t be infinitely valuable and beautiful, as long as it was lived genuinely and with honesty.    I think F was feeling the same way. We talked about it at length, about the beauty of everything. I felt elevated, above the world, like I was at the top of a mountain. It reminded me of a recurring dream I have of being both old and young at once in a ski cabin at the top of a mountain on an incredibly clear day, looking down, looking around, knowing everything I saw. This was the same feeling from that dream, but instead of knowing all I could see, I knew all my mind could think of. We both felt that having found this place of clarity and enlightenment would leave us changed in the best of ways, that we would be able to remember it in hard times and feel more at peace. Neither of us felt compelled to do it frequently, because this was satisfying, and that would be too much. F said that \'just knowing this is here is enough.\'    It was a very cold night, and we\'d been outside for well over an hour, and we were fucking cold. We tossed the can and went into the Student Union. I looked at my hands and they were swollen and red from the cold. As we started to warm up I realized how cold I had actually been and began to develop a headache. We went to the bathroom and ran our hands under warm water. We stood like that for an inassessable length of time, the water feeling strange and fascinating to my numbed hands, the color of the light and the colors and shadows of the counter and the sink and my hands seeming strange and off in an intangibly exciting way. I looked in the mirror for a while, looking at what I looked like. I was able to see what I looked like without my vision being clouded by my knowledge of myself from inside. When I stopped washing my hands, they felt re-born. I wanted very much to take a shower but I didn\'t remember that until I was on the verge of sleep.    When we were done in there, we went into the formal lounge. In spite of the late hour, there were two people in there talking. They were people with extremely large personalities, people who always seem to be putting on sort of a show, and it was very strange to see them talking to each other without being in a larger group. The two of us sat by the fire and just watched them. \'They\'re such trippy people,\' I said. One of them was even very strange and trippy looking. \'It\'s like watching two competing television shows.\' They thought we were odd, and mostly dismissed us because we were tripping. I just watched them, very entertained, for quite a while. The trippy looking one was going to go have a cigarette, and we asked if we could bum one. He said yeah, but he had to go back to his room and get them. We waited for a very short time, and then we forgot that we were waiting and went back to my room. I made a playlist of everything by The Doors (The real stuff by The Doors, not the shit churned out under the band\'s name after Jim Morrison died) and we got into my bed and listened to it, and fell asleep.    I woke up the next day before noon and wandered around doing different things, marveling at the world. I felt like a new person, and I felt very quiet, impressionable, and happy, all day. I was also confused and foggy and hungry for most of the day, and lights were still significantly brighter than usual. It eventually occurred to me that it was like being stoned all day, except with a rawness that came from the intensity of my experience the night before. This feeling lasted all day, and Z felt the same, and even F felt it, which surprised me, because it wasn\'t her first time tripping like it was ours. We all fell asleep pretty early that night. The next day was still happy, but sleepy and lethargic for most of the day, and that night I got drunk and smoked a lot of weed. After that, I was back to normal perceptually (not experientially, because I had about three weeks where every single night was somehow weird), but significantly changed.    I regard this as an incredibly positive experience. I definitely intend to do it again, but eating more seeds next time and maybe smoking weed earlier in the trip and more repeatedly. (And making sure I have a supply of cigarettes beforehand!) I\'d recommend it to just about anyone; the only experience I think one ought to have before LSA is with weed. This was my first trip and I didn\'t have any problems, but I don\'t think you\'d know what to do with the way you were feeling if you weren\'t familiar with marijuana, and it\'s a really good way to ease the comedown. LSA was a wonderful, beautiful, trip for me. And to make it even sweeter, it\'s legal!     Since the trip, smoking marijuana has had a different effect on me. A much, much better effect. I get far more ideas and am far more creative and talkative and awake, and I can access that enlightened, happy feeling that makes me feel like everything is right in my life much more easily."
64932,Approaching the Other Dimension,Suave,"Aug 15, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Age: 22  Experience type: First time  Previous experience: Alcohol, magic mushrooms, weed, speed, MDMA powder, ecstasy, herbal ecstasy (Trip-E), salvia  Years of experience with psychoactives: 8    I had bought a total of 30 Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds off the internet, and because I tend to enjoy exploring the creative and introspective aspects of drugs without any interference, especially the first time I take them, I decided to try some on my own in my studio flat. I was in a good mood and looking forward to the experience.  For anyone who does not want to read the entire account, I want to say that I highly recommend HBSs  it was without doubt one of the most stunning experiences Ive ever had  however I urge caution to people sensitive to psychedelics: the effect was incredible but surprisingly potent, and a considerably more thorough preparation than the one I undertook is suggested. I would also like to recommend putting up notices around the room with messages such as Dont panic! and Its just a drug  you will get out of it! in case the trip turns out to be a bit overpowering. I used to do this as a magic mushroom novice and I will be doing the same the next time I take HBSs.    I did not prepare for the trip in any way, except for reading about the general effects. I had eaten about two hours before the trip, which with hindsight was something of a mistake. I have previously tried herbal ecstasy  which, whilst stronger than I had been led to believe, is far weaker than most other drugs Ive taken  and as the particular type I took contained Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, I anticipated a similar effect from the seeds themselves.     At a quarter past eight in the evening I ingested five seeds by chewing them and keeping them in my mouth for about thirty seconds. Having read a few articles about HBSs, I knew that the best way to take them was to crush them and let them soak in a glass of distilled warm water until the water had cooled to room temperature, but I did not have the patience to do this! The seeds tasted quite bitter but went down without a fuss. Almost immediately, however, I started to feel nauseous and after about 20 minutes I had to vomit, this means that my total dose, including the additional two seeds I took a few hours into the trip, probably amounted to about four to five seeds rather than seven.     At about T=\xbd-1h, I was starting to come up. \x91Groundhog Day was showing on TV and I was extremely fascinated with how two-dimensional everything looked, as though each object and character in the film was a cardboard cut-out suspended a centimetre or so over an equally flat background. The theme of the film intrigued me, and I was deeply impressed with the script, the actors and pretty much everything else.     Two hours after the first dose I was tripping wildly and felt unable to sit still. I kept switching between sitting by the computer and lying in my bed whilst giggling constantly at the film, the commercials showing in between (although one, featuring two elderly ladies who looked like some sort of two-dimensional, gnome-like monsters, did disconcert me slightly) and the random thoughts that kept popping up in my head. As I was lying on the bed I realised that I was behaving rather like an animal, or a young child: rolling around, kicking and playing with my arms and legs, rocking back and forth whilst grinning like a loon, and stroking and poking at my skin. My body temperature had increased significantly  note that I was a bit ill and may have had a mild fever, although as I understand it some increase in body temperature is to be expected  and I felt compelled to remove all my clothes. Soon after I went over to my hallway mirror and stood there and admired myself for a minute or two, normally I dont find myself to be especially pretty, but at the time I thought myself to be a pure miracle of beauty.     Following that, I sat down in front of the computer to ponder the mental shifts I was experiencing. As soon as I turned my attention inwards, an incredibly profound sense of dissociation descended upon me, it felt, quite literally, as though I was physically standing on the brink of another existence. I was also able to travel back to old memories and relive them with amazing clarity. It was at this point, at around T=2\xbd-3h, that I decided to write down what I was experiencing. Its not an extensive account as my vision and mind were both too dazzled to focus properly on the computer screen, but it captures fairly accurately what I was feeling at the time:    I know I won\'t be able to remember this when I wake up, but it\'s like I\'m just on the cusp of another existence. It\'s just out of my grasp... like if I could reach out just a little bit further, I\'d be in a completely new realm of existence. I can see it. It seems impossible to explain, but I\'m familiar with the feeling. It\'s sharp, and seems to have a light texture to it. It\'s clear and direct... Really, I can\'t capture it but it\'s so familiar somehow. I can barely remember what life is like outside of this. I\'m glad I\'m not talking to anyone at the moment, I don\'t think I could cope.    Wow... Memories are so clear. I am actually at <a place of personal significance>. Wait, let me go back to the coffeeshop in Amsterdam... It\'s so clear, I can\'t believe it.     I wonder if the memory I have is from another drug experience... Mushrooms? Weed? I don\'t know. Man, this is so amazing, I just can\'t believe it.    I want to capture this feeling but I just cant. I know Ill read this tomorrow and think What the **** was I on? but I swear, this is special.    Every single word I read seems to be full of meaning. This is just so absurd... I cant make any sense of it at all. Flipping heck... I hope Ill recover from this!    Im behaving like an animal and I love it. It does make me reflect on the fact that words come so automatically to me, even when Im feeling so primitive. Im struggling to identify the language Im writing in, but semantically speaking I know its English.    Im sorry. I want to capture this, I want to keep this feeling but I cant.    About 4\xbd hours into the trip, I could feel myself starting to come down slightly. Being who I am, I instantly decided to take some more. I had been wanting to do something creative ever since the onset of the trip but hadnt been able to bring myself to, so I took an additional two seeds hoping it would bring me back up to the peak. The trip continued in the same vein as it had previously for about two or three hours after that: the walls were breathing, my room seemed to be alive, colours seemed unusually distinct and sharp and everything appeared oddly two-dimensional.     A couple of hours after the second dose, things started to go overboard. I felt sick and wanted to go to sleep but couldnt. Probably because I had eaten a small buttered bun soon after taking the second dose I was also suffering from terrible heartburn, and my mind would not rest, I kept having closed- and open-eye visuals, my thoughts were disorganised and confused and I was very hot. At one point, as I was lying on my stomach at the foot of the bed, I seriously considered whether I was suffering from an actual drug-induced psychosis and whether I might have to seek help. Fortunately  in a manner of speaking!  I started to feel very nauseous indeed and decided to go to the bathroom to throw up. I did so, violently, and whilst the resulting aftertaste was unbearably foul I immediately felt better. I ate some strawberries, drank some water and then went to bed and read for a couple of hours. At this point I started to experience mild nystagmus (rhythmic involuntary eye movements), and the open-eye visuals that had become extremely overpowering before I was sick were now milder and more benign.     Ten hours after taking the first five seeds I was able to get some rest. I enjoyed eight hours of dreamless sleep, and in spite of the frightening severity of the later stages of the trip I did not suffer from any notable hangover the following day, except for a slight sense of absent-mindedness.    Im intending to take HBSs soon again, perhaps next weekend, and this time I will not eat anything for at least six hours before. Ill keep the dose at between five and seven seeds and Ill definitely make sure to pick up a pen and paper as well as listen to some music  Im already looking forward to it! Ive never taken LSD so this trip was unquestionably up there among the strongest Ive had, if not the strongest."
16628,SynchedUp\x96Hot to Go!! Thru Psychedelic Lemonade,l1ghtware,"Dec 23, 2003","H.B. Woodrose, Ephedra & Nitrous Oxide","Substance:  HBW seeds.  Steeped in bottles of cool mineral water.  3 Bottles.  14 seeds each.  Seed shells removed before being ground up in small plastic bags with a hammer and then poured into the water.  Bottles sat for 5 days in cool dark closet to prevent loss of alkaloids.  First bottle completed before the others, then after observing the change in color of the water and being convinced of an effective water-only extraction I proceeded with two more bottles similarly.  The final concoction that was consumed was filtered of some of the larger chunks of observable plant matter compared to the prior experience related.    Prior:  My younger brother is a pretty adventurous person.  Upon discovering that I had purchased the seeds and that they were now in my possession, he enthusiastically decided he would like to try them that night.  I ground up 6 seeds (losing a little material in the process, so going with 6 instead of the suggested 4 for aprox. Threshold exp.), let them sit in cold tap water for an hour mixed with lemon juice to aid extraction (only remembering about the chlorine until later), then added sugar and let my brother drink.  To summarize, he complained of nausea and then tiredness before feeling slight but interesting effects.    Date of experience:  August 5, 2002    I thought this would be a good introductory psychedelic substance for myself.  Somewhat cheap, legal to purchase and get my hands on, with much more subtle if any visual effects, it seemed like a good choice -- although I was extremely wary of the other trips to be found in Difficult Exp. / Bad Trips / Health Problems, etc.  After having delved into a substantial experience with this substance I would wager a guess that the problems with many of these trips were witnessed due to not clearing off the shells on the seeds, consuming them by simply chewing them, or not approaching the substances cautiously in terms of dosage, although doubtlessly there were a few genuinely bad experiences due to unique reactions to the active substances.    7:30 PM  I added the lemon juice and sugar before I drank it.  Voila!  Psychedelic lemonade.  I should also note that to combat the tiredness that my younger brother complained of I consumed two pills of ephedra 30 minute before drinking the concoction, and also drank a glass of coffee minutes before as well.  Only drank 3/5 worth of the one bottle for about 6-9 seeds worth of alkaloids all things considered.    8:00 PM  Only 30 minutes in Im trying to see if I can sense it coming as early as possible.  Think I sense something maybe slightly.  Slight tiredness, a little listless, and also \x85 cant put my finger on it until 30 minutes later.    8:30 PM  Now noticing an increase of effects described above.  Could be because of other substances consumed as well.  Definitely am noting much more tiredness and somewhat dreamy quality, realizing it as what I couldnt define earlier.  Moderate level of nausea.    9:00 PM  Nausea has increased.  Dreaminess has increased, hard to pinpoint where this may mildly result from the tiredness or is of a substantial level to be an effect in and of itself.  Pretty sure abnormal dreaminess is occurring.  Easy but tired movement, but with a little energy behind it.  Think the ephedra is kicking in.  Starting to get highly disappointed in the results Im seeing.  Am convinced that it wont get much better than this, and that nausea still has a ways before it will even get better.  Decide to drink the remaining 2/5s.    9:30 PM  Still not noticing much, not seeing much interesting or beneficial to offset the amount of nausea Im feeling.    10:00 PM  My disappointment has peaked in part because the description from my younger brother left much to be desired and he did not see to find it very rewarding, and also considering how much Ive drank and feeling that this tiredness/dreaminess may be the primary effect and the extent of effects to be found, I decide (much too early) to go ahead and dump the other two bottles and call this a wasted venture.    10:30 PM  Only a little more of the same described above.  Fatigue, nausea with a little energy coming up behind it.  Invite my older brother to come upstairs and share some nitrous with me, it being his first time.  He says maybe in a bit.  I dont think he will be coming up.  Back to reading _American Gods_.    11:00 PM  Older brother knocks on the door and comes in.  Lament over only having one balloon left because our dog chewed up the other one.  I go first, do one cartridge.      Ill note that my first experience with nitrous put me off and left a lot to be desired.  I became pretty sure this wasnt that pleasant of an experience as I had wanted or expected.  I feel like Im kind of reneging on a little promise with myself to stay in the area of phenethylamines and tryptamines after reading PiHKAL and TiHKAL consecutively in the last week.  However my third attempt with nitrous is not nearly as bad, trying a method of rebreathing back into the balloon so as to be less wasteful and more effective.  I think theres a threshold with nitrous where I can make it to a mild buzzing discomfort that isnt that pleasant, but a little past that and it doesnt seem nearly as bothersome and the anesthetic disassociative headspace is interesting, but I remind myself not to get caught up in it and to do too much.  Ive come to conclusion that at least for myself and a couple friends that cannabis only dulls the experience of nitrous and should not be done in conjunction as it was our first time.    My brother goes second.  He likes it but maybe is a little put off as well.  I do another, now its better further in.  I close my eyes looking for a synergy between the LSA and the nitrous, maybe visuals as some described.  All I get is intense star clusters like the normal kind I get when I close my eyes real tight, but much more intense and substantial this time.  I tell my brother, All I see is lots of stars, in different clusters and starbursts.  Kinda feel like I have the universe inside.    He does his second and is quite pleased.  The lip of the balloon is dead and rebreathing using it is impossible now.  The comedown is full of lots of giggles and happiness.  Definitely high.  Wish I could do more and go a little further, but remember an incident where a friend got caught up in the experience to the point where he wanted to continue to do more and more to see how far he could go.  You can get caught up sort of in seeking to escape into the void-space this high provides.  Its not like I am seeking to null my thoughts out or anything quite so mundane, but it is like I find the switch to turn down all the outside noise and tune into the internal static inside myself and watch what thoughts and shapes it takes form into.  I withdraw from my environment but still minimally capable of interacting with it to the point of being able to inhale more, and may continue to do so until nearly unconscious OR I (unlikely but not impossible) or a friend stop me from doing more.  Or resources run dry.  It is also called hippie crack for a reason.      I will try to limit my use of this substance to a booster to help see if I can bring up the effects of other drugs.  And I have a nagging conviction that I should drop it all together. On the plus side it has removed much of my nausea from my mind for the time being.    11:30 PM  Still quite happy and goofy.  Beginning to wonder why I havent come down all the way off the nitrous yet.  Start to realize the nitrous may only be affecting me minimally now, and that something else is going on.    12:00 PM  Much of the nausea is down but not gone.  After the nitrous I had much energy, still do now but it is tempered by a bit of listless tiredness.  Yawns are erupting.  Another important note:  I have TMJ, a problem with my jaw hinge where if I leave my mouth open too wide too long it will get stuck.  I have ended up in the ER twice because of this.  The first time it was new and I discovered why it happened after visiting a doctor later (probably grinding my teeth at night  I have a problem with anxiety and tension).  The second time it was visiting friends at University in a college town and I got more drunk than I ever have before by finishing off close to a half of a bottle of Baccardi 151 by myself.  Reckless, I know.  What happens is the human jaw jumps out of its hinge to open up past a certain point, and to close it slides back down against some cartilage back into its hinge.  Wear down the cartilage and it can get stuck.  Trying to close your mouth can only make it worse if unsuccessful getting the muscles more tense and the joint more inflamed.  Kind of like one of those Chinese finer traps you play with as a kid.    For this reason these yawns are alarming me, and I focus on keeping lucid and aware despite my tiredness.  Start getting into philosophical debate with my brother, normally I dont agree much with what he is discussing or can see what hes saying on some levels but not agree, and then not understand what hes getting at on some deeper levels.  Well I realize something very interesting is going.  Its like the tiredness has started to peak, Im still quite euphoric, and theres some new energy level and thats started to infuse into the whole tired/dreaminess experience.  Philosophical discussion gets intense.  However, I understand very easily what my brother is talking about.  Continuing discussion begins to get intensely fun.    My brother leaves to go mellow out for it a bit.  I try to find him in a few minutes and find out why.  He says hes starting to feel high just talking to me.  All the effects Im experiencing very much seem to coincide with our philosophical debate, our very discussion of the universe.  The illusion of time.    I had read the electric Kool-Aid Acid Test a few days before, and I find it quite joyful and fascinating to see how my brothers discussion synchs with many of the things relayed and described through the book, and the feelings of the heads, the essential acid experience, and the relations to eastern philosophies and traditions, religions.  The illusion of time.  My brother describes it through Gnostic concepts.  There is some discussion of Jung, of some Buddhist beliefs, and it is interesting how the understanding of the universe in many of these so easily coincides.    Im utterly convinced of it now.    Jung called it synchronicity.  My older brother said Gnostics call it correspondence.    And I become convinced of the very magic of my being.    12:30 PM  Im pretty sure Im peaking now.  Surprised it has taken so long to reach this point.  Sad that I threw away the other two bottles.  No OEVs, other than the feeling of how illusory the world outside me has become, how convinced of this because of how very synched up I am.  The world has become more than just dream like now, it is as if I am seeing out of the bubble I have created and everything feels somewhat hollow around me, but all the more magical because of it.      When I close my eyes I realize I am getting some kind of visual.  Its funny because it is very stereotypically psychedelic.  I always imagined the old 70s colorful swirly shapes and contours surrounding each other could only be a poor misrepresentation of what a lot of people must really see.  In this case, it was in fact not!  If I began to pay attention I saw that I was seeing rivers of color with no clear beginning or end, no place where the peripheries began or ended, just the area I was focusing on where the river swirled with little curls and eddies and tide pools stemming off in different directions with many different colors with shapes inside of shapes.  Like a thick line of one bright color (bright blue, orange, red, green, doesnt matter) surrounded by a very similar shape of a different color with little distortions of the original shape it surrounded.  Much like some art that I have seen.    1:30 AM  My brother confided that he needed to get some sleep as much as he would like to stay up with me.  He goes off to bed in a bit after a little more discussion.  I dont want to quit talking with him about all these new profound ideas.  Not so much new things that I am hearing or discovering for the first time, but rather that I am finding a reason and validity in many of them that just did not present itself before.  Like I have attained some sort of empathy for the natural workings of the universe.  But of course I have, it emanates from me.  My illusions are shared with the illusions of others.    2:00 AM  I resign to go to bed.  I have no desire to stay up beside myself, seeing that Im coming down now and that I see no value in experiencing this alone.  Im ready for asleep.    The next day.  I am happier than ever I remember being in my entire life.  Full of energy.  No psychedelic side-effects, but every bit of much as the euphoria as before.  Singing to songs, beaming, clapping my hands.  Rapping!  Words tumble out in a stream.  I realize that I can best describe my feeling with English words as: SynchedUpHot to Go!!  It IS as if I am seeing the world for the first time.  As with a childs eyes.  When reading this description about mescaline from a few authors including Shulgin, I was wary to start with any other substance than mescaline for a first time.  Well I am exceedingly happy that this experience must have come close if not in a completely parallel trajectory.    Not only am I more happy than I ever remember being before throughout the entire day, I charge around the entire day with more natural happy-energy than I remember ever experiencing.  I have every desire to share it, to smile at strangers, wave at passerbys, sing songs.  Me and my older brother had come to the agreement that there are just some people Who Know.  People Who Know to some substantial extent.  And I begin to feel like I can ascertain Who Knows within moments of meeting them.  Somehow, through whatever method, they have come to similar basic realizations.  Whether they be acid heads, born-again Christians, monks, people happy with living simple lives, teachers, or philosophers.    I listen to The Chemical Brothers Come With Us album before heading to school for work.  Yeah, they know too.    Two days later  Much of the same feeling is with me although admittedly and sadly to a lesser extent.  I was absolutely ecstatic yesterday.  I feel glad knowing the realizations that I know now and that they will never leave me, although without exercise and concentration, that if I take them for granted these realizations and the feelings that come from them will leave me with time.  I need to learn how to practice different forms of meditation.  I commit myself to treating my acne by disciplining myself in regards to exercise and diet.  And mood.    I want to label that night a ++++ experience, but Im hesitant to do so with so few experiences to compare it to.  But thinking about it I know I will remember that night and the following day for the rest of my life.  Ill call it a +4, you call it what you will."
6333,Heroically Parading,Maidens_Wattle,"Apr 19, 2001","Huasca Brew (B. caapi, Syrian Rue, P. viridis, M. tenuiflora), A. nervosa, & Mushrooms - P. cubensis","Day 1:   I ground 5 gm of Peganum harmala seeds, 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, & approx. 25 cm of Cielo Banisteriopsis caapi vine bark into powder. I then added 5000 mg of vitamin C & boiled in a non-aluminum pot (aluminum does not react well with ayahuasca) for approx. 7 hrs. The liquid was first strained through a fine metal screen, & then through a coffee filter. I set the liquid aside, & re-boiled the leftovers for an additional 2 hrs. The same straining procedure was followed, & the liquids were combined. I then boiled the combined liquids until it reached a volume of approx. 1/2cup. This was then refrigerated.    Day 2:   I ground 17 g of Mimosa hostilis root bark into powder. I then minced 60 dried Psychotria viridis leaves & 13 fresh Psilocybe cubensis mushroom caps. All materials were placed into a relatively larger non-aluminum pot, with the addition of 5000 mg more of vitamin C. This was then boiled for roughly the same amount of time as the brew from Day 1...the same straining & re-boiling methods were followed as well. The liquids were then combined & boiled down to a volume of approx. 1cup. This also was refrigerated.    Day 3:   I fasted all day, as well as the 2 previous preparation days. I spent my waking hrs. reading & meditating through the creation of music on various instruments. When the feeling came upon me to ingest the forbidden liquids, it was already 9:00 pm. I decided that such a combination of psycho-active plants wasn\'t anything to toy with, so I gathered up the mandatory tools for a long night in the woods. (tent,water,cannabis,etc.) Before I left for my journey, I drank the extremely bitter MOAI/LSA tea. I figured that by the time I reached my destination, the effects would have begun to take hold.   Half way into the thorn infested woods of the Natchez Trace, I began to feel nauseating, yet calming air of the brew. By the time I reached a spot in which I was happy with, about 30 min. had passed. I now felt that it was time to start out on the true journey, for which I had waited so long. The DMT/psilocybin tea was then removed from my bag & swiftly ingested to avoid prolonged interaction with this nasty shit.     About 30 min. later, the brew was beginning to taint my existance with CEV\'s, & before I knew it, vomit was upon me. I ventured off a good 30 ft. for the hacking in order to avoid smelling, stepping in, or interaction in any way with the fowl mess. The release of the brews was extremely satisfying & welcomed...I\'m always game for a good puke session.    After the vomiting, I smoked a few bowls of cannabis, & then everything was different. Within the next 20 min., all recollection myself, & the past events were gone. I was\'nt able to see trees or plants any longer. Everything took on a new shape. There were even walls of patterns & light that appeared in front of me.(keep in mind that this was all open eye)There were images of life, light,& sound EVERYWHERE, but I was\'nt able progress toward them. Every time I attempted get closer, the walls & beings would keep their same distance. I was able to hear 2 different dialogues - one of which I was able to understand, but the other was a combination of sounds so unlike anything I had ever heard that I almost want to say that it was\'nt a voice at all, but the patternized walls making making visual sylables.     I had thousands of rational thoughts going on, with which I was explaining to myself what was happening in front of me, but none of them make very much sense to me now.     After I came to the realization that a human was\'nt able to move about through this dimention, I laid down on the bare ground, closed my eyes, & was then able to watch the walls unfold before me. A great feeling energy came over me once I understood that to exist here, you don\'t need a phisical self, only the idea of one.     I must have wandered through those walls for an eternity...I was even able to make them shift & re-shape upon will. The entire time that this was going on, the ever-so-loud dialogue in which I understood was assuring me that this place would exist forever, & that I would meet with it much more in the future. This calmed me to no extent.     After lying on the ground in a timeless state, I regained the knowledge of where my physical self was, I realized that the multiple eternities in which I just experienced was only 5 hrs.!     I spent the rest of the night reflecting on EVERYTHING...not just my hallucinogenic state, but everything that ever happened to everyone. I felt as if all knowledge was handed to me for a short period of time, & it I felt very rewarded.      While reflecting, I did my best on setting up my tent, & building a fire. I sat smoking cannabis & watching the fire from my tent until morning - all of the time sorting through the overwhelming amount of knowledge I was given...or should I say loaned."
115590,Mind Blowing and Incomprehensibly Beautiful,Ivan ,"Jul 28, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Zopiclone,"This one\'s going to be long and detailed so be aware of that if you don\'t feel like a long read. However I thought I would get everything down as it was so different for me compared to the other experiences I read about.     This was my first time getting high in any form and it\'s not what I expected even after reading obsessively accounts of other people\'s experiences. I\'m allergic to marijuana so all three times I tried that, I was crestfallen that it didn\'t meet my expectations (an understatement). But I badly wanted to see something, and feel something new I badly wanted to see something, and feel something new so I decided to try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.     I\'m 5ft10 and approximately 75kg. I live in chronic pain and suffer from depression and PTSD. I knew it was a risk to do this but it seemed worth it to me. I\'m lucky that it didn\'t trigger something bad because that\'s a reckless way of thinking.     I ordered a pack of 25 seeds off of a well known auction site and the first batch arrived old and stale. I cut them in half and only 5 appeared to have any contents. I decided to chew some and save the others for a cold extraction, as I wasn\'t sure that being old meant they were useless or not. This try failed. The ones I chewed (I chewed about 6) worked for about 3 minutes. I had a banging headache and the sensation of one massive cramp in the stomach, followed by a couple of minutes of seeing stripes. The striped looked like the sort you\'d see if you\'d been staring at window blinds on a sunny day too long and looked away. That was it... Awful headache that lasted 2 days.     I messaged the seller and mentioned that the seeds were old. They sent me for free, 25 super fresh ones for no charge at all.    Two days go by and I see the envelope in the letterbox and I immediately go to look at these seeds. These really were fresh! All looked completely different and no hollow old ones. I was excited and couldn\'t wait to see what they would do.     Now here\'s my warning... I went behind my wife\'s back and when I was bombed out of my tiny little box I truly upset her. She was upset that I didn\'t tell her and that I\'d gone behind her back. She felt I lied to her and treated her like a fool. She was right... I was so so wrong. Have a sitter who knows what you\'re going to do as you don\'t know how you\'re going to react or act when these hit you. And if something goes wrong, they wouldn\'t know what\'s wrong with you. And seriously, don\'t lie to your spouse or not tell them. The disappointment and anger she reacted with upon finding out totally ruined the trip for me.    That aside, here\'s what happened. I decided not to do a cold water extraction and just chew these up. I chewed 4. Nothing happened. An hour goes by and nothing at all. I chewed 4 more, again... Nothing happened for another hour. I got a mild headache again but nothing like the first time. So being impatient and dumb, I chewed the rest. I consumed 25 seeds in total and didn\'t realise that they\'d not just hit me later... But hit me damn hard.     40 minutes in I start having tears running down my face. Not from crying, but like when you\'ve got an allergy or you\'re withdrawing from painkillers and there\'s no itch. However the lacrimation is intense and my nose is slightly runny.    An hour goes by and I start to feel queasy. It\'s not unbearable and it\'s not too bad. I have a strong stomach so I figured that\'s as bad as it gets. 15 minutes go by and my stomach feels like I\'m going to chunder. My head starts spinning a little and I have trouble balancing. Not so much that it\'s too noticeable, I just look clumsy and a bit like when I\'ve just woken up and gone straight on my feet without brain engaging. My limbs feel heavy and I think I must be getting sleepy. The kind of sleepy I\'ve got after travelling where I\'d just like to faceplant on a hotel bed and forget all about wakefulness and all my thoughts and problems.     I puke into the toilet. It was bad! I felt absolutely dire. My stomach was rejecting its contents with violence here. I felt truly sick and I went to lie down in the lounge where my wife watched TV. My throat starts jumping around like I\'m about to heave again but it\'s not too bad. However I ask my wife for a zopiclone to put me out of my misery and sleep this off. I couldn\'t face a night of feeling this bad and at some point I remember wondering if I had made a terrible mistake. I felt so sick I panicked and thought perhaps if it gets worse I might die. Sounds dramatic now but it felt that bad. I really felt like I\'d been poisoned in every sense of the word.     Here I notice my breathing feels shallow. This worries me and I start thinking about telling my wife about what I\'d done as I felt like breathing was slow. It was like someone had a weight on my chest and it wasn\'t fun. The nausea really eased off fast after the zopiclone but sleepy is the opposite of what I felt. I asked my wife to put on the star projector we have in the lounge while I try to chill out enough to nap. She was watching a film and pretty sleepy herself so she didn\'t really notice me being weird. I just said I was feeling a bit sick and sore and needed to lie down to sleep. Being in chronic pain all the time, this wasn\'t unusual for me. I popped a propranolol to stop the vasoconstriction I was feeling and that I read about. My head felt tight and my ears rung a little. And smell... My god the smells of anything got overpowering. It was like I went from smelling nothing to smelling everything in distilled and extra strength. Even nice smells were painfully overpowering.    All of a sudden, I felt this cold sensation like a slowly creeping stream all the way down my body from head to toe. It was like every single muscle, bone and sore patch of skin was evaporating the pain. The pain was absolutely gone and replaced with this floaty and cool feeling, not unlike getting into a  cold pool or stream on a hot day.     I tried to roll a cigarette but was having trouble coordinating my movements. And then I noticed my vision start to change. The colours from the projector are insane! I\'d never seen anything so vivid and beautiful in my life! The colours from the whole room looked like they were running or melting off the wall but they looked like multicoloured smoke. The green laser dots from the projector looked like fairies. They were still green but they were not dots so much as moving fireflies with wings and the dots on the ceiling were much less bright than they should be, but there were more of them. It was like looking at moving stars on a really dark sky away from the lights of a city. If you\'ve ever been somewhere really remote at night, far from an urban area, you\'ll know what I mean when I say the stars are numerous and look nothing like they do anywhere else. It was like there was a moving galaxy of stars on that ceiling and they twinkled beautifully from green to aqua blue and cyan non stop.     The colours on the projector that are meant to simulate clouds were like bright red and orange smoke. It looked like a twister or coloured smoke and I don\'t know how to compare it to anything in real life. It isn\'t like psychedelic art or anything I\'d seen in pictures inspired by LSD or shrooms or weed. This was so loving and so beautiful. It was like someone had given me a warm hug and the room was absolutely awe-inspiringly beautiful.     I stumbled to the bathroom to look in the mirror. My eyes weren\'t at all dilated. I took a picture of myself to check in the morning in case my eyes were playing tricks on me. They weren\'t dilated at all. Nothing had changed in my appearance. The only thing I observed was my vision kept shifting from making every detail, every pore, and every capillary on my face from super vivid (I looked like I was ageing at a rapid pace) to soft and light like a filter you can use on social media on selfies.     I went to the kitchen to look in the big mirror. The light kept brightening and intensifying and then simmering back down again and so on. Like someone was turning the contrast up and down. When the light brightened, it felt like it was coming from a different source or from an alien place. I stroked my cats and the fur felt like it was the softest thing I\'d ever touched. As I stroked the cat I felt like time had slowed down. I was watching and doing things in slow motion. His fur felt like a kitten\'s fur but even softer. My black cat appeared inky blue now as if he was out in the moonlight in the woods instead of in a dimly lit room at home. I tried making a peanut butter sandwich and it felt more difficult than usual. Eating was not fun. It was like I\'d slowed down time so much that I could feel every component of that peanut butter and bread as I chewed and it was like chewing dirt. It didn\'t help that my mouth was also incredibly dry - bone dry.     I went back into the lounge and my wife noticed I was acting strangely. I couldn\'t answer a question she asked and looked drunk. The answer totally slipped my mind and I couldn\'t retrieve it. I just stood there confused and trying to concentrate. I asked if I could have something to eat that was sweet and she asked if ""I\'d got the munchies"". I mistook this turn of phrase for being busted as having taken something and laughed a little too hard. She asked why I was acting oddly and I thought it wouldn\'t be a big deal to tell her. I was wrong...    She was furious that I\'d not told her and that I went behind her back doing this. She felt let down and like I was treating her like a fool. It wasn\'t me getting high she was mad at. She was mad I made her feel excluded, like a fool and in the dark. She asked me over the last couple of weeks what my fascination was with psychoactive plants that I was reading about and I told her I was just interested in the nature of them. She felt I had lied to her face right then when she found me out that night. She said it was going to be a long time until she trusted me again. Then and there it was like I lost everything. I told her why I\'d done it. That I didn\'t think she\'d understand. Her reply was that she wasn\'t given the option to understand or the chance to. I told her I thought maybe it\'d reset my brain somehow if it worked. That maybe the pain would go away, that it\'d help the PTSD and insomnia. I told her I thought maybe it\'d reset my brain somehow if it worked. That maybe the pain would go away, that it\'d help the PTSD and insomnia. She sniped back that all I got was a handful of magic beans and lost something far more precious... Her trust.     I honestly thought then and there I had ruined everything and lost her. She has a thing about people lying to her and she never expected it from me. To her not telling her something is the same thing as lying too. I tried to smoke a cigarette and it kept going out and the lighter wouldn\'t spark. She told me to put the cigarette out and go to sleep. We\'ll deal with this bullshit in the morning. She was so angry she formed a first around her sandwich that she was eating and crushed the whole thing. Shortly after she put her sleeping mask on and went to sleep.    I felt so utterly foolish and hurt. Yet I couldn\'t escape the fact I\'d done this and I couldn\'t blame anyone or anything but myself for it. I felt then and there I had ruined everything and it\'d never be the same again. What had I done? I wished this was all a nightmare but I knew I wasn\'t dreaming it. And that hurt like nothing had hurt ever before.     The colours kept streaming and being beautiful. My pain was still gone and I felt like I was observing my emotions from a distance and couldn\'t cry or do anything about them physically. It was like I was in my body feeling them all, but not quite attached to them. Yet the gravity of it all was more intense somehow. I can\'t explain it very well but it was like feelings were a completely new experience being felt for the first time with pure clarity.     I kept watching the projector and the streaming smoke like colours on the walls. The stars with wings. It was undeniably beautiful even in a moment like this despite how I felt emotionally. It made me feel even worse as I didn\'t feel like it was right to enjoy anything right now. On an even less pleasant note, my muscles were so relaxed that I felt like if I needed to go to the toilet all of a sudden, I probably wouldn\'t make it without soiling myself. Luckily that didn\'t happen.     Eventually I drifted off to sleep and had no dreams at all. When I woke up my pain was mostly my headache and back but not all encompassing like usual. I felt fresher somehow and more awake but then it hit me that we had a fight and it was time to face the music. Long story short I gave my word that I would never do something like that behind her back again and she explained how she felt. I\'m still in the shit and I know it but at least I have a chance to make it right. In short, I\'m an idiot and I deserve to be in the doghouse honestly.     As for the trip itself, had it not been for the argument - hell yeah! But don\'t scoff at the nausea. It is violently bad and I still felt pukey the next day. My vision went back to normal apart from when I closed my eyes, I can still see bright colours like an afterglow of the night before. I was also not as sharp with simple tasks without dropping things or answering questions until a good 12 hours after waking up at least.     If I could compare the visuals to anything it would be the scenes from the movie Dredd (the newest one) when a character uses the drug slo-mo. The colours, the sparkling and the smoke-like quality of the colours running was very similar but not the same. It was incredibly beautiful and for me, totally unexpected. My experience was very visual and touching things magnified the pleasant feelings and minimised any coarseness or discomfort upon contact. My pain was gone and I felt like I was brand new but time was slowed down to molasses pace. It was nothing like what I expected and I don\'t know whether zopiclone had something to do with it. So yeah... 25 seeds, chewed and swallowed and a zopiclone after puking my guts out and feeling like I was going to die... The parts after that, not including the argument, was absolutely heavenly. But I wasn\'t normal the next day or capable of driving, or doing complex tasks of any sort. It feels like a hangover in many ways and I wasn\'t 100% functional for much other than staying home and doing ordinary chores or making coffee etc. The headache on the latter end was intense, too."
108047,Ego Stripping,Fleuriel,"May 2, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Before I explain my experience I want to state that I\'ve never been drunk, or smoked cigarettes, I had smoked weed, eaten edibles and taken MDMA twice in my life before this experience and had very little knowledge of psychedelics at that time. I had a great deal of trust for the person that I experienced this with who has had experience with psychedelics. This was my first time with anything psychedelic.     We were in his apartment and had talked throughout the day about the HBW seeds. He offered me the opportunity to experience this with him and though I was quite shy about it I gathered the confidence I needed to take the next step in my human experience. I was ready. Also I did eat a meal sometime before this and said a little prayer and asked my guides to support me through this experience.    After I felt I understood what I was getting into I took 7 seeds. He had taken 14; about 10 at first, then 4 more later. He said he felt nothing for a while, saying it was very subtle. I was relaxing, paying attention to my body\'s subtle cues and allowing myself to relax and welcome this new experience.  I was relaxing, paying attention to my body\'s subtle cues and allowing myself to relax and welcome this new experience. I felt I had to sit down because I felt I was getting heavier. Not necessarily my body, my energy felt heavy with weight. I sat for a while and then decided I needed to lay down, as I was feeling a bit tired. So I laid down for what seemed like an hour or so. The experience was equally steady that whole time. I felt weird energies within me but they were not extreme. At one point when I did close my eyes I saw these images of my partner dancing around naked and silly, his bobbing and bouncing without a body in my mind. I decided not to close my eyes after that xD.     Suddenly this wave of energies I never felt before hit me like a tidal wave, flowing within me with strength like the ocean. It\'s hard to explain, but it made me feel like I jut wanted to close my eyes and wait \'til it was over. I was feeling very nauseous, my head was very heavy, and my body even heavier and quite ungraceful. My partner was laying with me during this time and I had this very clear knowing that I needed to throw up.     \'I needed to throw up but I don\'t want to\', I said.  \'Do what you need to do, don\'t hold it in\', he assured me.    When I got up to move I realized how trying a task it was. I didn\'t want to exert the energy to move 10 feet to the bathroom but it was a destination I knew would be a worthwhile journey. I hung over the mattress just hoping I could throw up there, seeing the long and arduous quest ahead of me. My partner encouraged me to move to the bathroom and it gave me the ambition to push myself in that direction. Every foot that hit the floor was the stomp of a giant, my body flinging around trying to avoid the walls that separated me from my salvation.    I threw myself at the mercy of the porcelain god, my head heavy, smacked down on the alter rim. I started creating affirmations in my mind, that I was safe and the pain felt good. The pain I felt was that of nausea and my body working hard to convert my food into vomit. Not long after I puked and it was glorious. The pain turned into comfort and I started feeling a lot better. (Blessed all the days I practiced my affirmations).    The journey just began. I didn\'t throw up much before I took shelter on the bathroom floor. I felt very safe in that bathroom. It was my partner\'s turn to vomit, which it took him some time to do. He had a hard time \'letting go\'. I asked my guide to help him and shortly after he was able to release.    Now we were at the same point in our journey. I was pretty balanced and feeling a bit nauseous but only a little every so often, not enough to through up but enough to make me want to stay on that floor, breathing deeply and freshly, filling my body with healing.     Now I need to explain my partner\'s intentions which were personal but I feel I need to share the point of this experience. He had something he needed to tell me but had a lot holding him back. Likewise, we were at a point in the relationship where transparency was lacking and it was harming us on a spiritual level. So this experience became an ego-stripping event.     The rest of the time we spent in that bathroom was admitting, confessing, and releasing all unbalanced thoughts and emotions that we had held back; were afraid to express, no matter how insignificant the other thought it was. At this point we had relieved ourselves of our clothing and he took the role of shower-messiah and washed away our sins.     Despite my creative writing I had not experienced hallucinations; visual or else (except that short moment when I closed my eyes at the beginning). My experience was strictly on a physical level and maybe something else I can\'t explain. While we were letting go of our emotional set-backs, I had no feelings or emotions during that time. I don\'t know if it was the physical discomforts that prevented me from connecting to my emotions or if it was indeed the seeds. Either way, I did not feel any remorse, guilt, sadness, or fear of any kind, likewise I felt no joy or ecstasy. Only the nausea, heaviness of the body, and the spiritual/emotional muscles of holding things back. At one point I realized I wasn\'t feeling physical pain. Looking down at my wrist/elbow which was pressing into the hard floor I realized I should take the weight off because even though I didn\'t feel the pain I knew that it was under stress. I made sure to be conscious of my position so not wake up the next day with bruises and aches.    It\'s also important to note that after we both threw up the first time he told me that the nausea is something that we are holding back and need to release. I don\'t know if that was true or, if him telling me that, made it true to me I don\'t know if that was true or, if him telling me that, made it true to me, but I felt better after I confessed things, things that surfaced to my mind, and felt nauseous when I held them back.     This went on for time I can\'t comprehend. Then it finally was coming to an end. I felt the experience slowing, wearing away and good thing too because I was done confessing for some time. Near the end I started thinking of other people that I held stuff back with. One was my grandma, who smoked a lot when I was young. Knowing at a young age that it was harmful to the body I threw my grandmas large box of cigarette packs into the garbage. She found out and yelled at me. I held that memory with me, feeling extreme sadness that she valued her addiction more than she loved me. So after letting go of all the things before that, I knew now how harmful it was to hold onto these things. So I opened up and pushed myself to let go of those feelings that I held onto. Then in a brief moment I felt my grandma take a deep breath and I thought she died. Only later did I realize that me holding onto those thoughts not only afflicted me but actually afflicted her too, and the breath I felt her take was one of relief. That I had freed her somehow, by freeing myself from those stuck emotions; an experience we both shared.    Finally it was over. I didn\'t want to leave the bathroom. I was so happy there but we had soaked in that shower long enough. He had retired to the mattress and I was still very happy on the floor. It took a while but eventually I made it to the bed. Laying there and enjoying the relief of not being nauseous anymore. It took me a while to fall asleep so we spent sometime relaxing and talking. At one point I saw this dark blob of energy up in the corner above the bed with red or yellow eyes. The room was dimly lit. I was not afraid and didn\'t focus on it and it didn\'t bother us.    This experience brought to me the realization that when we hold onto baggage, and thoughts and feelings we feel we should share, we are not only hurting ourselves but are weighing down all those involved, and that freeing ourselves will indefinitely free the world.     With Love,  Fleuriel"
113835,My Sense of Time Went Out the Window,Ben,"Dec 19, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"On LSA Time    This is a report about my most recent LSA experience about a month and a half ago. I had taken LSA seeds a few times before. The first time I tried to make a tea extract, but it was very weak and left me disappointed. The second time I decided I would eat the seeds and so I ate 5 seeds and this time experienced something more profound, but certainly not very intense. It was similar to a slight marijuana buzz, but nothing more. I then had subsequent experiences eating 8 seeds and 10 seeds and at that dosage, what I experienced was way more intense than 5 seeds. I was surprised at how big of a difference there was in experience between 5 and 8 leading me to think that the strengths of the seeds increase logarithmically. I think this is a little known idea with LSA seeds that people should keep in mind with their dosage.     As for the experience, it was a Sunday afternoon and my friend K, who had not even had alcohol yet despite being a senior in college, surprised me by expressing interest in trying the HBWR seeds I had bought online. I was excited by the prospect of trying the seeds with another person since I had only tried them alone before. Strangely enough, the strength of this 8 seed experience was much stronger than my previous 8 seed experience  the strength of this 8 seed experience was much stronger than my previous 8 seed experience, leading me to realize that potency does vary a lot with these seeds (even within the same batch). I should also say that physically, I probably made a bad decision in taking these seeds when I did because that same weekend I had ran a 5k race and drank Saturday night. By Sunday, my body was not ready for something as physically hard on the body as Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds are. I think it was my friends enthusiasm that made me make this bad decision and I think my physical state definitely effected my experience. My previous experiences had been largely positive, but this one was very up and down.    Around 2 pm, we ate 8 seeds. The LSA hit me more slowly than my friend. We were sitting in my room and he was enjoying the physical sensation of bobbing his upper body up and down. I thought he looked strange doing this and became concerned for him. I worried that maybe I had given him too much, especially for someone with very little drug experience. With LSA, it amplifies whatever emotions I feel by like a 1000, so I started out in a very anxious, nervous state and went through all sorts of negative thought loops about what I might have done to my friend and the consequences legally for me. This part of the experience was unenjoyable, luckily it would have been worse if I felt this way while peaking (I was still in the come up). Later he began writing something on his phone saying over and over what did I write and this also put me in a very negative state as I thought the LSA had caught him in some terrible thought pattern as well. However he later showed me what he wrote and it was a beautiful poem. It was at this point that the first negative thought loop ended and we both entered a sort of euphoric state.    As the LSA ramped up more and more in my brain it amplified all my emotions by what felt like 10,000 times. This amplification of emotion mixed with the beautiful feeling of relief that my friend hadnt gone completely psychotic made us both feel absolutely euphoric. At this point as we talked about his poem I felt, for perhaps the first time in my life, like my emotional state was completely melded with another persons. The LSA made us so emotional we were both crying over his poem uncontrollably. We listened to our favorite songs and I perceived them as being so beautiful I was moved to tears. This is what LSA is all about. It is not particularly visual, I actually think of it more as an emotional stimulant or amplifier. I felt that my emotional state was completely connected to Ks. I marveled at how connected I could feel with others during this experience.     After awhile though, our euphoria subsided and a wave of negativity came back to me. Since this drug amplified whatever emotion I feel, this turn towards negativity proved to be quite distressing. As the reality of my bodys physical state from a weekend of running, partying and now LSA became apparent, I began to become very paranoid about my health. In this paranoid state, I began peaking. This was a terrible time to be feeling negative. I tried to get up and move but found the sedative effects of the seeds to make it difficult. I became scared of lying still and scared of moving and began overthinking everything. Whenever I tried to walk around to a new room or consider going outside to walk and calm down, the flood of sensory information made me feel anxious and paranoid. What was even worse was that it was in this emotional state that my sense of time suddenly went out the window.    I felt suddenly like I was in some sort of limbo world in between life and death that simply happened to resemble my apartment. I felt like I had been on LSA forever and would be on LSA forever. I was trapped in a timeless void where nothing changed or advanced or evolved. Normally I would be enjoying the slight visuals of LSA at this point in the experience, but I was too anxious to pay any attention to them. Me and K tried to go outside, but I could only stare at the ground because the visuals were now overwhelming. I remember looking at the trees and the leaves had all turned into geometric, vibrantly colored shapes. Normally I would have loved the beauty of it, but for some reason I just felt paranoid. Normally I would have loved the beauty of it, but for some reason I just felt paranoid.    Eventually time did come back and we realized that we were very slowly starting to come down. We reminded ourselves of time passing by looking at the clock every few minutes and telling each other the time. At this point I calmed down a lot and a feeling of extreme calm washed over me. I was so relieved and happy to have come out of the void of infinite time and somewhat back down to earth. During my experience, K had been mostly wandering around the house or in the bathroom feeling sick. He told me he never threw up and that he enjoyed the beginning of the experience when he wrote the poem, but that after that he just wanted it to end.     My appraisal of this HBWR experience the day after was that the beautiful and euphoric parts of the experience roughly canceled out the anxious, paranoid, negative parts. Although I did focus mostly on the negative in this report, the majority of my experiences with LSA had been extremely spiritual, euphoric and wonderfully introspective. I think what had made my experience difficult at parts was the fact that my body needed recovery at the very moment that I put it through hbwr, which is very hard on the body and cardiovascular system. If I had been healthy, well rested and less spontaneous, I would have probably had a good experience like my other LSA trips. Tripping with K also made my emotional experience dependent on his. If he felt bad, I felt bad, if he felt euphoric I would feel euphoric. However, the euphoria I felt with a euphoric friend was definitely stronger than the euphoria of LSA alone. If one is considering LSA, I would recommend being well rested, mentally prepared and tripping with a friend that one knows will be a positive influence."
112715,A Sublime Journey,Earth Traveler,"Jan 4, 2019",Amanitas - A. muscaria & H.B. Woodrose,"A Sublime Journey    Amanita muscaria mushrooms have been used for centuries to alter consciousness by shamans in Siberia and other cultures. Occasionally Ive found beautiful specimens among the pines in the back yard of my Wyoming mountain home, before theyre harvested by squirrels. This springs weather conditions produced an unprecedented huge crop of large ones, some the size of tea saucers. They appeared just as I had begun reading Michael Pollans fascinating study of psychedelics history and ongoing research, How to Change Your Mind. The synchronicity was my green light suggesting it was finally time to experiment again. So I gathered and dried a batch.    In the early \x9160s I took a couple of trips with morning glory seeds. The first time I prepared well, had a good guide, and had a transcendent perience. My second trip was awful because I wasnt careful enough about set and setting, and took the drug out of curiosity rather than as a sacrament. The last of my six LSD trips was in the early 70s. Aside from cannabis, that was the extent of my drug experimentation. For the last several years Id been feeling a growing urge to once again try an entheogen  a drug that causes one to become inspired or to experience feelings of inspiration, often in a religious or spiritual manner.    Ive studied taiji for over 45 years and have faithfully practiced meditation (mostly Buddhist insight meditation) for over 40 years. Id been feeling stuck in my meditation practice for a while, and hoped a mushroom journey would help me find a way through that. Although the &#64258;uidity of the sense of self is familiar territory to me by now, I believed the mushroom would also make that more clear. And it did.     In order to be a better guide for me, the trusted friend who agreed to be my anchor read Pollans book and took a mushroom journey by himself a couple weeks before mine. He lives in a gorgeous rural setting, far from neighbors, with a river running through the back yard, a perfect retreat space. Around 9:30 AM on September 12, 2018, I carefully chewed up a medium-size mushroom (one medium cap of amanita) and four Hawaiian baby wild rose seeds (chemically similar to morning glory seeds). I included the seeds because my friend had taken them on his mushroom trip and had a powerful positive experience. The mushroom tasted earthy and unique. The seeds had little taste. I started experiencing a perceptual shift within minutes.    So much happened during my mushroom journey that the following day I thought I could write an extremely long story or a short novel about it. Instead Ive had difficulty writing anything at all. The experience was so profound that words can barely hint at the reality. The day was sublime and magnificent, and I spent much of it in awe. Recalling it continues to inspire awe. Because of my meditation practice I encountered nothing unfamiliar.  Recalling it continues to inspire awe. Because of my meditation practice I encountered nothing unfamiliar. Yet like looking at things through a microscope or telescope, the ordinary was transformed into the extraordinary.    My primary goal was to ask the mushrooms help in exploring some habitual physical knots, in particular one calf muscle Ive been trying to loosen for years with little success. When my friend massaged it, his touch released a stream of childhood memories involving my large, close, extended family. I was transported to a family farm and searched through memories and feelings until settling on a painful incident involving a cousins betrayal. The accompanying humiliation was apparently the source of my leg discomfort. I have yet to understand the connection, and there has been no noticeable change in the muscle.     Touch on the other knee brought up memories of its own physical injury, which also happened around that time, involving another cousin. I was surprised to discover many tight muscles in that calf as well. Ive been exploring that injurys physical consequences since the memory came up in taiji years ago, but Id paid little attention before to the emotional aspects of the memory. I now recalled humiliation, growing up in Wyoming with great pressure to cowboy up, tough it out, be a man, and above all dont be a sissy and cry. While exploring my calf muscles a few days later, I remembered the phrase to cut someone off at the knees, de&#64257;ned as to squelch or humiliate suddenly and thoroughly. This made perfect sense.    I spent much of the day thinking about my many cousins and countless other people I love. Each person I thought of seemed quite present, in a state where time and space were far more elastic. As I lay on my back on the grass under a favorite tree, listening to the river, watching the blue sky and clouds through shimmering leaves, each falling leaf seemed like a jolly little reminder to wake up. I felt profound love for the tree, which had provided me welcome shade on many summer days, and opportunities to watch nesting birds. I realized that everything in nature can be a teacher if we slow down enough to truly pay attention to the natural world, including the body.    Many insights came while thinking about my taiji students and how I might teach them more effectively. I realized that we contract our neck muscles in reaction to thoughts of both superiority and inferiority. When we feel inferior or unworthy, the mid-back bends forward, the shoulders round in submission and defensiveness, and the neck pinches. When we feel superior, we tighten the mid-back, pull the shoulders back, and tilt the head back in conceit, pinching the neck. In addition to molding customary posture, this dynamic also happens at subtle levels from moment to moment as our thoughts constantly swing from one pole to the other, coming to rest only when the ego is silent.    I came to regard the mushroom as a wise, benevolent guide and helper. It reminded me frequently to notice the tensions in my belly as well. Although I never actually felt nauseated, throughout the day I felt countless gentle upchuck-impulse signals to slow down, pay attention, and relax the abdominal muscles. (The closest I came to nausea was in response to my friends suggestion that I take a later booster dose of mushroom, which I declined.) The subtle nausea signals continued to a lesser degree three weeks later, repeatedly showing me how habitually I hold unnecessary belly tensions. Over and over I was reminded to let go of any resistance as soon as I noticed it.    I was pleasantly surprised by how functional I was throughout the day, and the experience bolstered my confidence in my ability to deal with whatever may come my way. My friend said later that I was unusually gregarious and extroverted. I was unusually gregarious and extroverted. I became very talkative, and was aware that my unusual behavior was sometimes unsettling to him. I got plenty of practice watching my impulse to apologize.    Years ago at a three-week meditation retreat, a new group of people joined us halfway through. Their much faster energy felt like being in a swarm of bees or a herd of buffalo. Similarly, during my mushroom journey my friends pace seemed like sitting next to a busy freeway. When I went to bed at eleven that night, my mind was still so active that I didnt fall asleep for a couple more hours, well past my usual bedtime.    In the course of my mushroom journey I offered up two prayers: May I be a clear channel for this love, and May this understanding continue. The increased level of sensitivity and body awareness does continue. Whenever I slow down enough, I can easily find my way back to that awareness. When I step outdoors, nature clears my mind more easily than before. After a lifetime of soap opera drama and angst, much of my time in recent years is spent in peaceful bliss. My mushroom  experience taught me a different way of seeing, making that state easier to access.    Id like to take another journey in solitude, perhaps next spring, to see how that changes the experience. Next time Ill skip the Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds. Wondering whether a dried mushroom quali&#64257;es as a living being, I recall the Buddhas encouragement to avoid holding on to the idea that a self, a person, a living being, or a lifespan exists. Nonetheless, I imagine the mushroom as a friend living under the soil in the back yard, now asleep for the winter."
111204,Overall It Wasn\'t Pleasant,Psychexplorer,"May 15, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Unpleasant First Experience    Previous experience: Low doses of LSD    So I had heard of HBWR seeds while researching legal psychedelics online. I was very interested in these seeds after reading trip reports of amazing and intense experiences. I had been waiting for the seeds to arrive for about 10 days, so I was very excited when they finally arrived. I decided I would try them the next day. When I woke up the next day, I was eager to try the seeds. My dad was the only one home and he was going to be leaving for a few hours so it was a good opportunity to try them. I should mention that no other drugs were used this day.    10:40 AM   I had decided to use the sublingual method in order to hopefully eliminate all nausea. This method simply consists of chewing the seeds for 15-30 mins and then spitting out the seeds. I decided on a small dose of 3 seeds. Since I had ordered Hawaiian strain seeds which had a lot of good reviews, I figured they would be high potency and that I should be cautious. I began my preparation by scraping off what small amount of the fuzzy tan colored husk remained on the seeds, and then proceeded to crush the three seeds in a plastic bag. The reason for crushing them was to increase surface area in my mouth and therefore increase absorption of the LSA. After crushing the seeds, I poured the powder into my mouth and began to chew and swish it around. It didn\'t taste terrible but it also wasn\'t pleasant.    11:10 AM  I had been swishing the seeds in my mouth for the past half hour and a lot of saliva had built up, it was hard not to swallow. I was definitely ready to spit out the seeds. I spat them out and rinsed my mouth out with water, which was a relief. I also took a 1200mg turmeric capsule in an attempt to combat any vasoconstriction that might take place. There were no effects at this point but I figured it would probably take a good hour to notice anything.     Note: Some of the following times are estimations as I did not go into this experience with the intention of writing a trip report.    12:00 PM  Still no effects. I\'m starting to loose hope that these seeds will actually do anything, so I decide to chew another seed. I pop it in my mouth without crushing it and chew it, but only for 15 minutes. I figured 15 minutes would still be plenty and I was too impatient to chew it for 30 minutes as before. I decide to go outside and shoot a few baskets while I chew the seed since I\'m bored. While chewing I swallow a little of the seed infused saliva in hopes that it will kick start the experience. I quickly grow tired of shooting baskets and the ball is somewhat flat so I head back inside.    12:20 PM   I hadn\'t been doing much for the past 20 minutes except for going on my phone and walking around the house trying to see if I noticed anything. I was quickly loosing all hope of the seeds working, and I wasn\'t in a great mood considering I spent good money on the seeds and had waited so long for them to arrive. At this point I decided to take another seed. I chew it as I did previously for 15 minutes and without crushing it, but at this point I\'m desperate to get some sort of result so I just swallow it instead of spitting it out. I decide to play a little Xbox to pass the time.     12:45 PM  I\'m in a somewhat bad mood and the video games don\'t seem very fun. My dad also gets back at this point, and I turn off the Xbox. I decide to eat another seed. I figure that maybe the sublingual method doesn\'t work and by eating another I will have eaten 2 whole seeds which might be enough for some mild effects at least. After eating the seed I decide that I won\'t have any more and that I\'m just going to stop worrying about it and see if I notice any effects later on. At this point I have had a total of 6 seeds, 4 of them with the sublingual method and 2 seeds eaten.     1:00 PM  At this point my dad is having lunch and I go to have lunch with him. Before going to the table I check my pupils, they appear to be slightly larger but not enough for him to notice. As I\'m eating lunch, I think I notice a slight soreness or tightness in my neck and eating food feels slightly different as well. I think I notice a slight soreness or tightness in my neck and eating food feels slightly different as well. Both of these symptoms I experience on LSD so I know that they are an effect of the seeds. I\'m somewhat excited that the seeds are at least having some effect. It\'s also worth noting that I don\'t have any nausea, which is usually an issue with these seeds. Maybe there would be nausea if I had eaten more.    2:00 PM   After eating lunch I had begun to feel somewhat tired. This feeling had now progressed into a lethargic drowsy feeling, which was not pleasant at all. There was no euphoria or other positive effects I just felt really tired and not that good in general.     2:20 PM I felt even more sluggish and drowsy at this point and I decided that taking a nap would probably make me feel better. I told my dad I was going to take a nap and went upstairs. Before I got in my bed I set my alarm for 3:20 since I didn\'t want to sleep all day which I felt was possible based on how tired I felt. I got in bed without undressing and tried to get comfortable. Once I felt fairly comfortable I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep. I began to notice something odd. Every 20 seconds or so I felt a wave of mental sound, if you could call it that. I have very mild tinnitus and it sounded like that, except that it was in my brain and it was loud and uncomfortable. A burst of it would occur every 20 seconds or so. The first time it happened I flinched because it surprised me and I opened my eyes. I noticed it only happened when I closed my eyes which was very odd. I tried to fall asleep but when I closed my eyes I would anticipate the next wave of sound and when it hit I had to open my eyes. I don\'t remember how I fell asleep, but surprisingly I fell asleep pretty quickly. Maybe the sound stopped and that allowed me to fall asleep.     3:00 PM  I woke up before my alarm went off. The first thing I noticed was that my limbs felt very weak, and they also felt tingly as if they were about to fall asleep. This wasn\'t a pleasant feeling, since I kept moving my arms and legs to try to get the sleeping feeling to go away but it made no difference. I tried to make a fist and squeeze but my grip felt extremely weak. I lay in my bed for a couple minutes before I decided to get up and use the bathroom. I stood up and felt weak but I could walk fine. I went in to the bathroom and tried to pee. I stood there for around 30 seconds trying to pee when suddenly my head felt different, sort of like a slight pressure. At about the same moment my vision started to get grainy with lots of tiny black pinpricks and they began to fill up my vision. I quickly rushed out of the bathroom and headed for my room, which was luckily very close. My vision rapidly covered over in a matter of seconds and as I entered my room I couldn\'t see at all. Despite my eyes being open it was totally black except for a sort of fuzzy indistinct kaleidoscopic pattern covering the blackness. I stumbled into my bed and layed down.     Immediately I noticed something else.  My tinnitus which is normally very mild, was increasing in loudness and pitch. This was the scariest part, I still couldn\'t see anything except for the pattern in the blackness, and the tinnitus rapidly got louder and louder. I was shocked that this was happening and I wondered if I had made a big mistake in taking the seeds. The sound got to an almost unbearable pitch and I was freaking out but trying to stay calm by thinking to myself that no matter what happened it would end eventually. Fortunately my vision quickly began to come back and shortly after the tinnitus began to get less loud. In a minute I was okay and I layed there in relief.     4:00 PM  I had been laying in bed for the past hour watching YouTube videos, trying to pass the time and distract myself from what had happened. I hadn\'t gotten out of bed thus far since I was scared that it would happen again, but I decided to try. I sat up and felt okay, and then proceeded to stand by my bed for a minute to make sure I was good. I felt alright so I went to go to the bathroom. This time I had no trouble going to the bathroom and I felt okay, albeit still tired and somewhat tingly. I went downstairs and went on my phone for a while.    For the rest of the day I felt tired and slightly depressed, but nothing terrible. I fell asleep easily enough that night and felt better in the morning.    Overall it wasn\'t a pleasant experience but definitely could have been worse. The one really bad moment didn\'t last long, and other than that it was just an annoyance to feel bad all day. The one good thing about it was I didn\'t get any nausea and I learned to be careful with dosing because effects can hit much later. From what I could tell the sublingual method was relatively ineffective, considering I didn\'t notice any effects until I ate the 2 seeds. My theory is that the sublingual method didn\'t work, so I pretty much had 2 seeds. Maybe 2 seeds was enough to cause some negative effects but not enough to actually trip. If that were the case, then the negative effects would have essentially outweighed the positive, since the positive were virtually nonexistent. I don\'t want to jump to any conclusions however, so I\'ll probably try the sublingual method on it\'s own with more seeds. I might also try eating more seeds, but I can\'t say for sure after what happened with just eating 2. <!--If you do try HBWR please be careful and definitely don\'t try too many for your first time.    Thanks for reading and have a great day!-->"
111802,Pleasure and Terror Mixed,PathFinder,"Apr 27, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I had chosen to try Argyreia nervosa seeds after seeing them on sale on a website where I had previously bought San Pedro cactus. I had spent some days researching about it and thought it would be a good idea to try it with a friend. We were somewhat frustrated by our previous experience with San Pedro cactus, so we wanted to have an intense experience with argyreia nervosa seeds.    Preparation:    We ordered 50 seeds online. We prepared a cold water extraction. We ground the seeds in a blender, put them in a bottle shielded from light and added water with a little of natural lemon juice mixed. We had boiled the water before adding it. We left the bottle resting in the fridge overnight, shaking it vigorously from time to time.     In the following day we had a cinnamon tea before drinking the extract, we thought it would be a good idea to help with the vasoconstriction effects. We strained the extract, threw away the ground seeds and added a little of cinnamon tea to the extract (I had previously read about a theoretical LSA to LSH conversion with cinnamon, so I thought it would be a good idea).    Setting:    I was in my friends house, our girlfriends were there to sit us. The setting was very comfortable, I had already tripped there before with Nbome and it was nice. We left some trance music playing.     My friend felt nausea while drinking the extract. I kept the sips in my mouth for some minutes before swallowing them, believing it would be absorbed sublingually. I kept the sips in my mouth for some minutes before swallowing them, believing it would be absorbed sublingually.    Onset (about 30 minutes to 1 hour):    After some minutes, I started to feel stimulated, I was speaking a lot, but saying nothing. My friend lay on the bed and couldnt move anymore, the sedative effects were taking place. He could speak to me and said he was seeing a lot of geometric colorful visuals with his eyes closed.    After a while, my friend could move again. I started feeling vasoconstriction and I also felt my body very heavy. Here my terror was starting to take place. I went to the kitchen and called my friend. I started preparing some cinnamon tea, believing it would relieve the vasoconstriction effects, we were feeling heavy. My friend wanted to go back to the bedroom but I insisted he stayed with me to have some tea, believing things would get worse if we didnt have it.     Peak (3 to 4 hours):    Suddenly, I had nausea and rushed to the bathroom. There, I vomited and felt a little better. I went to the bedroom, where my friend was lying. I lay on the bed too and then I couldnt move. I talked to my friend and my girlfriend while I was lying there and suddenly I started seeing geometrical and colorful patterns. After some minutes, I think, I couldnt even speak anymore. They were laughing, talking, thinking I was having a nice trip, when I was actually feeling terrorized. For some minutes I simply existed, I think I have experienced what they call ego death. I couldnt speak, move, for some seconds I forgot everything, I had some auditory hallucinations, some kind of a metallic robotic sound. I was completely taken by terror, like I would collapse there. During this time I had intense geometrical visuals.     While this happened, my friend left the room while I tried to ask him not to, mumbling some sound, but I couldnt speak. I wanted everyone to stay there with me. I wanted everyone to stay there with me.    Suddenly I had an urge to vomit. I got up, rushed to the window and expurgated everything. While I vomited I thought I would suffocate to death. I felt totally wasted.    My friend heard the vomiting and asked me to go to the bathroom and take a shower. I walked to the bathroom with my girlfriends help. There, I had a very deep introspective experience. I was sitting on the floor wearing only my underwear while my girlfriend was there helping me getting up and going to the shower. I felt ridiculed, helpless and depressed. I started talking about life, about work, college, family... everything. It was like all my life had compressed upon me at that moment. I told my girlfriend I was already feeling ok, that she could talk as usual with me, that she shouldnt assure me that I was having a good trip (I felt that the peak had already passed and I was going to be ok from that moment on). I said something about my colleagues at work and my girlfriend asked about a girl who had recently started working with me (she was suspecting we had something between us). I felt I was being manipulated by her, she started crying and then I started saying a lot of things, telling my girlfriend that I had never been so sure that I wanted to stay with her only, that this girl at work was nothing to me. I started crying at this moment. I started telling her that I felt overwhelmed by everything in life, that people placed too many expectations upon me, I felt I couldnt handle them and at this moment it felt I had expurgated everything bad I had inside me. It was a catharsis! We hugged and cried.     I tried to get up and take a shower, but I couldnt, I was afraid of the water. The vasoconstriction was making me feel very bad. I didnt want to drink water either, thinking I would throw it up.     My friend wanted to use the bathroom, so I got dressed, and when I opened the door he was there, lying on the floor telling me the floor had never felt so nice to him. At this moment I felt great, I told him the experience was being wonderful. I felt relieved after crying. I asked my girlfriend to keep the bedroom door open because I was afraid my friend would vomit and suffocate as he was lying on the floor.     Me and my girlfriend laid on the bed. For some minutes I felt very well, I had a nice experience, we were exchanging lovely words. But suddenly I felt the terror again. I kept for some hours breathing heavy, feeling I was gonna die, that I would have a heart attack or stop breathing. My girlfriend kept all night telling me I was ok, that the trip was coming down, that my breathing was ok, trying to relax me. During these moments I heard my friend vomiting in the bathroom.    When the sun rose, I started feeling a strong vasoconstriction, I felt all my body numb, even the head. I sat on the bed, I felt I was gonna die. I couldnt move my hand and legs properly, the vasoconstriction was really unbearable. I thought I would have to amputate my fingers or feet. My friends got worried. I panicked, I told them it was better to call an ambulance. They called the emergency, but they didnt take us seriously, they said they couldnt answer that kind of emergency. Then they called a taxi to take me to the hospital. I tried walking to the taxi with their help.     Come down (3 to 4 hours):    As we arrived at the hospital, I started to feel better. I drank some water, walked, and the vasoconstriction was coming down. There was no doctor to assist us (the doctor had left before the time he was due) and we had to wait for the next doctor to work that morning. We waited for half an hour. I had some mild visuals in the waiting room, seeing face patterns on the floor and geometrical patterns on the cup of water I was holding. I was called to the doctors room. I explained the situation and she asked me to check my glucose levels before doing something else.    I thought they were just going to put me on IV to rehydrate my body and I didnt want to stay there. Fortunately, it wasnt anything serious, I had just panicked. Fortunately, it wasnt anything serious, I had just panicked. I felt pissed off by the hospital staff and by the waiting time and left to the street with my girlfriend.  We stopped by a snack bar and I tried to eat something and rehydrate. During this time I had a deep talk with my girlfriend about what had happened before.     I felt really tired and we walked home. I tried to sleep, but I couldnt, every time I felt asleep I would suddenly wake up again feeling scared. I went to the computer to pass some time and then I went back to bed and could finally sleep.     *\t*\t*\t*    We underestimated Argyreia nervosa. It was a tough experience. We should have had a lower dosage. But after all, we achieved our objective of having an intense trip, it just wasnt the trip we expected to have. Although I was completely taken by terror during most of the trip, the introspective experiences were worth it. Maybe I will try it again in the future, but with a lower dosage, of course."
94234,Effective Overdose,Senior ,"Nov 30, 2017",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue Extract,"HBWR Effective Overdose    Background experience:   In the late 1970\'s and 80\'s, I experienced LSD numerous times (lost track - perhaps 30-40 times), often combined with marijuana.  Innocent curiosity and a desire for consciousness expansion was the motivation for taking it the first time.  I was so blown away and utterly amazed by the power of something so small.      But later I started abusing this sacred substance by pleasure seeking too often, like going to concerts and movies, music listening, cruising, hiking in Yosemite, and soon became burnt out; the pleasure seeking became elusive the more I chased after it, some were bad trips, and my senses became jaded.  I had no mature perspective, became solipsistic, lonely, and depressed.     But my LSD experience and insights, of ego death and ecstasy, of seeing the Perfect Intelligence underlying all things, still remains the greatest, most beautiful, most clear and undeniably real experience of my life. So that\'s the extent of my psychoactive experience.     In the 90\'s, I cleaned up, became a vegetarian, became a friend of ISKON (Krishna Consciousness), chanted, exercised a lot, got into bodybuilding, got a job, later got married, dropped the vegetarian diet, worked lots of OT to pay for house mortgage, private schooling for the kids. . . now they are in college as I write this report. Around 2010 I felt (I don\'t know why) the need to connect again with Cosmic Intelligence, but had no resources. I researched on the Internet and learned about psychoactive plants, ayahuasca, pharmahuasca, and Shulgin\'s designer drugs, McKenna, and the advances in the field.     I obtained 2C-I and had two experiences with it so far (2ci is not an entheogen in my opinion; it is psychoactive, opened up and melted my heart, revealed subconscious material with realizations, and made me cry a lot or on the edge of tears - but an entheogen it is not). I am more mature now, and intend to use these materials sparingly as sacraments to connect with higher consciousness, and not abuse the power they bring. When we were kids the thrill of the roller coaster was fun; dizzy was fun.  But dizzy makes seniors sick.  Now as a senior I am after clean clarity, insights and intelligence, to continue my psychonaut exploration from my early twenties in a safe and responsible manner Now as a senior I am after clean clarity, insights and intelligence, to continue my psychonaut exploration from my early twenties in a safe and responsible manner, to train hard at the gym, eat healthy, take bodybuilding and nootropic supplements, fulfill all my secular responsibilities and continue to work for the prosperity of my family. I believe my desire for expansion and transcendence beyond the mundane material world is natural and not perverse. When I go on vacation, my brain goes with me, filtering so much. I feel the need for a real vacation away from myself and my brain and all its filtering.  I feel the need to connect with Supreme Intelligence, to sunbathe in that light and bliss and refresh the soul, and to connect with the prime motive for the big bang.  I don\'t want to wait for death in order to connect.  Plants can help to heal and balance us.  That is my intention. This is my background.    So now it\'s Dec 2011. I am on vacation. I have done more reading on entheogens and have ordered materials. The first material to come in the mail is Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Later I receive harmala extract. More materials are on the way.  But I am excited and can hardly wait to get started. Spontaneously I decide to go for it.  From my reading, I know HBWR has a heavy body load. The harmaline\'s MAOI will potentiate the LSA, perhaps turn it more akin to a LSD experience, I am hoping. I make powder out of 8 HBWR seeds; massage the powder into a teaspoon of butter, molding it into a suppository.  I stick the homemade suppository in the freezer and take the harmala extract.     T-0: I take 100mg harmala extract.  T-30: I insert the butter suppository rectally.  T-60: I feel signs. I go for a light jog around the block.  T-1.5hr At home now, I hang upside down and stretch out on an inversion table.  T-2hr coming on stronger now, equilibrium is out of whack, feel dizzy and drunk, stumbling around, starting to wish I hadn\'t done this    T-2.5hr growing stronger now. Feeling drunk.  My legs and arms are heavy. I look in the mirror.  My eyes are half open, like I\'m on some sort of sedative (in contrast to LSD which makes my eyes wide open and big, like ultra awake). It feels like the tail end of an LSD trip, when I am landing and coming down, tired and spent and wanting to sleep.     T-3hr I try to listen to music but find it annoying. This stuff is unrelenting, growing stronger by the minute. I am beginning to feel really uncomfortable.  I observed a MAOI restrictive diet, and during the past several days I also have been dosing piracetam and choline nootropic.  I still start to feel hypertension and a vague weight on my chest. I place a hand over my heart and feel my wrist trying to gauge my pulse.  It\'s not racing, but time is starting to distort. I regret taking HBWR and wish I could back out of it.    T-3.5 Unrelenting and growing stronger, I am on the edge of panic. But I am my own sitter, and try to remain calm and in control.  The idea occurs to me: MAOIs potentiate by x2 or more, so it\'s like I plugged 16 seeds (3-6 seeds are typical). I sit in the lotus position, breathe long and deep, and with each exhalation repeat \'relax, let go\'. I remind myself this will pass; it\'s only temporary, everything is fine, everything is alright. But the hypertension is still growing; I am feeling a vague tightness and weight on my chest, and tension around my neck. If it were not for this hypertension, I might be able to explore and enjoy this altered state. Oh well, just chalk this one up; I just want out of it, but there was no escaping it.  I was shivering, so I lay down and threw on a blanket, still remembering to breathe deep, reassuring myself everything is okay.    T-4 I can\'t believe it. It\'s still growing stronger. Perhaps that\'s a property of rectal administration, longer lasting.  I looked at the clock.  Only a few minutes had passed but seemed like hours. Not much in the way of CEVs or OEVs. But as I laid quietly in the dark under the blanket trying for sleep, I heard weird noises, not out there as brought in by the eardrums so that you can locate the source, but noises \'heard\' inside: an often repeated long \'vvvooom\' sound, and weird science fiction space sounds, like being on a home PC with a Science Fiction\' theme. Then I heard techno music as from a rave, growing louder and clearer, interspersed with horns that came in at surprising times, so that it had a jazzy feel. But all along that blasted oppressive hypertension feeling hung over me.  I want to be rid of it.    T-5 I called my sister on my iPhone. I told her what I did. We talked and my anxiety lessened. After about half an hour, I felt sleepy, so I assured her I am fine and we ended our conversation.    T-6 Couldn\'t sleep, hypertension still upon me. I kept hearing weird science fiction noises. I imagined what would happen if on the next breath my heart would seize up in a massive heart attack. I thought of Michael Jackson. I am not ready for death yet. The thought got me more anxious. I called my sister back. She was concerned. I told her I drank 5 bottles of water but my mouth remained so dry and still felt thirsty, but I felt nauseous when drinking water so had to take it down slow with sips over time. I told her I wish this stuff to be out of my body.  She said I need an IV (my sister is a retired RN). She convinced me to go to the hospital emergency, speak privately with the doctor, and get an IV. I woke up my son, and he drove me to the hospital. As we drove, something in me started to well up. Tears started to pour silently down my eyes. I tried to hold it back but could not contain it anymore. So I broke down and let it out. I connected with a primal uncontrollable cry.  My son rubbed my shoulder and said you\'re going to be okay, dad. My son rubbed my shoulder and said you\'re going to be okay, dad.  I said I am so sorry son I have not been a good dad to you. He said you\'re alright dad, I love you. I love you son, I responded. Walking to the hospital emergency entrance, surprisingly I felt the anxiety and weight had lifted off of me in route.  I believe my primal cry dispelled the anxiety.  But since we made the trip, I still checked in and got an IV as instructed by my sister. After taking in all the fluid of the IV bag, I got released and we went home.  My sister followed us home and visited briefly. Soon after I went to sleep and slept soundly for 6 hours. My wife returned home from work. My wife, daughter and I went out to eat.  I am still feeling an afterglow.    Evaluation: I overdosed with 8 seeds potentiated by harmaline. Previously I was on a fast which made my body even more sensitive. I don\'t think I can fairly evaluate HBWR because of the way I administered it. But my first impression is that it\'s not a clean and clear high that springs forth insights. I don\'t like sedation, dullness, delirium, drunkenness, cold shivers, dizziness, spinning, and hypertension. The body must remain safe and sound and transparent as much as possible as one explores the astral world. I want clean and low body loads. I want clarity and profound insights.  I want to be in the flash zone.  I want light.      Perhaps subconscious repressions add to anxiety.  Because of working a lot of overtime, I didnt give and share a lot of time with my children as they grew up. The years just flew by so fast so now my son is already 21 years old and in college.  I didnt know that weighed on me.  I had other realizations too, but this was the most significant one.  So it was not a totally negative experience.  Remember MAOIs potentiate by at least a factor of x2, so adjust dosage accordingly. Also for me, I will adjust the harmaline extract dosage down to 30mg.  I think its better to take things orally rather than plug them.  At least I can cause yourself to puke way easier than shit to purge myself.  Dont assume because you have prior experience you can handle.  Respect the power of all psychoactive substances.  Start with lighter dose.  More can be taken a few hours later.  Or in the next trip you can adjust accordingly.  Dont be impatient.  There is always next time.  No experience is a waste.  Also rid the body of tensions beforehand, through exercise, yoga, time on the beach, and massage. Set and setting are so important.  Adhere to a MAOI restrictive diet before and after using MAOIs. I believe when under the influence one is susceptible to suggestion and the body feels sometimes a little alien besides, so that body tensions can be misconstrued as MAOI hypertension.     I am going to add to my tool kit one of those gizmos that monitors your heart rate (useful when working out too).  Then I have an objective measure. Or I just wont take any MAOI, just take more shrooms or whatever.  But Ayahuasca requires MAOI.  I will need to research what substances are useful to counteract MAOI hypertension, and keep this on hand."
78842,Constant State of Arrival,Shadowmesh,"Oct 10, 2017","H.B. Woodrose, Meclizine & Cannabis","[Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    Before going into detail about my recent experience, I should first make known my history with lysergic acid amides. During my teen years I used to chase down and consume LSD with reckless abandon, ranging between 1 to 10 doses at a time, and quite frequently. As such, I\'m well acquainted with the way my mind reacts to the stuff, if not too well. Whether the LSD was responsible for exacerbating the mental illness that I\'ve experienced since then, I don\'t know for certain, but I do know that I chose to abstain from ingesting it for years. Now, ten years later (at age 28), I find myself returning to the well, so to speak, with a thirst for more knowledge regarding LSA\'s.    In the few weeks prior to my most recent experience, I\'ve been carefully studying and ingesting the LSA\'s that are found in Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds, and with wonderful results. Suffice it to say, it\'s a lot like LSD, only with less intense visuals (less colors, mostly) and a greater body sensation. Although the Morning Glory seeds are effective, I was never really happy with the amount required for ingestion, which ranged between 150 to 550 seeds per experience. Also, I tried a popular extraction method with a large batch of Morning Glory seeds and failed miserably. The logical progression, then, was for me to start scavenging around the internet in search of the more potent relatives to those seeds, the popular Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.    It was just two days ago that I conducted my very first personal experiment with HBWR seeds. I obtained a pack of 50 seeds through a popular online auction site. The strain of seeds I ordered came from mainland Hawaii, as opposed to all the other strains that are said to be weaker in potency. (I suppose the other Hawaiian islands\' seeds can\'t be too much less potent, since it\'s all volcanic soil, but that\'s just a guess.) In preparation, due to my weak stomach and my SEVERE aversion to vomiting, I swallowed four Dramamine Less Drowsy pills (Meclizine HCL, usually available at any drug store or supermarket) and waited two hours for my slow metabolism to eat it all up. I then used a razor blade to scrape the supposedly-toxic brown fuzz off of 10 seeds until they took on a more creamy color and proceeded to chop them in a clean pepper grinder, allowing the ground-up bits to fall into a very, very small bowl of applesauce (four or five spoonfuls). Finally, I ate the sauce gradually (over the course of 15 minutes), just in case the seeds had the potential to shock my system into nausea. Fortunately, I was never once nauseous throughout the whole experience.    I knew it would be another 2 or 3 hours until the peak of my experience, so I drove to the state forest to pass some time by taking a hike. This, I knew, was also a mildly effective way to combat vascular constriction, should any arise. It was just about an hour after ingestion that I stopped to sit on a rock and smoke a half-packed bowl of some mid-grade cannabis. During those few minutes I noticed some barely perceptible augmentations in my internal dialogue, in a sense that my thoughts began looping together a bit, and somewhat more rapidly than usual. I couldn\'t tell yet, though, whether this was simply the weed doing its thing or the seeds kicking in. At any rate, I got up and began my journey back out of the forest.    My body felt a little heavy and lethargic as I made my way, so I simply strolled along at a very leisurely pace to avoid upsetting my body, not sure if too much movement would make me nauseous. I did feel a noticeable rumble in the tummy, but it felt more like gas than nausea. Now back at the car, it was about an hour and a half after ingestion, and I was still not feeling anything more than the threshold effects of the seeds, coupled with a nice marijuana high. Nothing overtly psychedelic going on yet. I started questioning the age and potency of the seeds I ordered. Was I ripped off, perhaps? As I started driving, though, the physical effects grew stronger, and my sense of spacial orientation was recognizably altered, yet not in the form of visual distortion; and probably not enough to present a driving hazard at all. As far as I was concerned, I was 99 percent cognizant, not yet truly under the influence enough to warrant a designated driver.    I arrived back home at 2 hours after initial ingestion, and was still a bit disappointed, though I did experience some mild visual distortion upon entering the front door. It was a bright and sunny day outside, but when the door closed, my eyes beheld the wonder of a dimly-lit (and totally groovy) living room. The darker areas of the room were stretching, or breathing, in a more pronounced manner than the brighter parts, and these same dark spaces possessed slightly more pronounced colors than the rest of the room. Also, my body felt deeply relaxed and invigorated, not at all uncomfortable. This was in no way a dirty high, and that realization made me grin from ear to ear. (That grin, as it turned out, lasted for the next two or three hours!) I was clearly beyond the threshold stage of the trip, but I definitely wasn\'t anywhere near a full-blown psychedelic peak. Normally, with Morning Glory seeds, I started fully peaking at this point in time. Did I put the seeds in too much applesauce? Were they really just weaker than everybody claimed them to be?    I sat down in the living room and made my way through another half-packed bowl of cannabis as I listened to my (currently) favorite psychedelic sound band, Black Dice. (Specifically, the Broken Ear Record.) A half hour into it, my mind was working its way into a spiral of looping thought patterns that were coinciding specifically with the music\'s wavering, intertwining, echoing amalgamations. My ears were locked right into the curvaceous contours of the sound waves they were soaking up. It was in the middle of this loop of thoughts that the song Twins began to play, and I started giggling out loud... then laughing hysterically! I\'ve never heard anything so hilariously disjointed, awkward, obtuse, and simultaneously psychedelic happening in such a specific, cohesive way! I couldn\'t figure out how these guys recorded the song without laughing their asses off throughout!    That\'s when it hit me. When the song ended, I realized that I just came out of a 3 minute laughing spree of the most absurd kind. We\'re talking borderline hysterics. My entire field of vision was now soaked in distortion, growth, color, and a bit of the stuff. (That\'s the phrase I use to describe the vaporous, holographic, colorful images or patterns that pass through my field of vision, which don\'t seem to have any immediate attachment to the real, physical objects around me.) It felt very much like I was tripping on psilocybin mushrooms, only with a much deeper and more sedating body vibe. I felt as though I was in a constant state of arrival from each split second to the next, only without ever truly departing. (I think that\'s discussed in the movie Waking Life.)    I had just passed the 3 hour mark, and I felt completely ecstatic. Downright giddy. The best way I could describe it to my friends later on was that I felt like a flower that appears to be in full bloom, but it just keeps blooming! That\'s why my next move surprised me. How could I go from feeling so natural and free to wanting to play my PLAYSTATION 3? Video games are normally very entertaining for me, but not many of them (if any, I thought) could be considered worth spending time with in a visionary, psychedelic sense. Contrary to this intuition, I picked up the controller and started playing a game called Eden (a PixelJunk game by Baiyon). My high-definition TV and 5.1 surround sound system saturated me in a series of growing, writhing, pulsating sights and sounds that I felt privileged to be a part of. I felt soothed by a heavenly vortex of morphing elements, totally at home and at peace with my environment. To top it off, I wasn\'t just observing, I was participating by moving a little character in this virtual universe in order to make everything happy! I kept sighing out loud, Wow...    After gaming out for an hour, I found myself wearing the same perpetual grin I had been feeling for the past hour and a half! I felt a spontaneous rush of social energy that I really wanted to expend, and began calling a few friends so that I could describe and share the success of my endeavors. I know most people find such tasks bothersome from time to time in the middle of a trip, but I always feel such fluidity of linguistic expression, despite the mere symbolism of words, even when I\'m on LSA\'s (except for when too much LSD used to tangle me up in webs). Unfortunately, nobody was home, so I just left a bunch of discreet-yet-boastful voice mail messages about my experience, hoping that they would sympathize with my excitement.    As the day moved on I busied myself with various psychedelic endeavors, including making amazing noises and sound effects with my guitar, kneeling in the stairwell and just being another fixed object in the house for a while, and shutting myself in the bathroom so that I could stand still in the dark and behold the crazy things that made themselves known to my senses as I quieted them. When my wife came home it was already at least four to five hours past the initial peak, which was itself about 3 hours long. We chatted for a few minutes and then decided to catch some sleep.    The next day I felt great. Perfectly fit. Just a bit more thirsty than usual, but not constantly parched or anything. This was atypical for me, as far as LSA goes. I\'m normally VERY drowsy, and sometimes even trembling profusely the day after ingesting Morning Glory seeds. But on this occasion, I was fine. I set forth straightway in telling all my friends about the wonders I\'d discovered the previous day, and all were very happy. Enough so, in fact, that I am now compelled to share this with the world at large."
109527,The Elsa Flip,trippMcNippers,"Apr 18, 2017",H.B. Woodrose & MDMA,"To set the scene, I was in the midst of what I now can see was a futile attempt to glean some answers from the pretty lights a months-long cycle of blasting my head apart with reckless abandon and sifting through the pieces in the hopes that some magical purpose for my life would emerge. It didnt work, and I got lucky Im on the other side of that particular idiocy, but I say all this to illustrate the unfortunate shade that was cast over this period of my life.     Several other people were sucked into and eventually hurt by this pitiful, desperate ploy for some sort of an identity I will not attempt to break down all of my relationships at this point in my life here, but they were not in great shape (which was entirely my fault). My roommate, A, is an incredibly nice guy; he and I lived together a condo owned by his family and I paid a fraction of the worth of rent purely because of him. Good vibes. Our friend who was responsible for the chemistry that made this trip possible, B, was introduced to me by A he is also a dear friend.    In terms of physical setting, I was really all over the place over the course of this trip, ranging from the apartment of my friend, who will be B, to my own place, to downtown collegetownville, Alabama. Going into the trip I gave virtually no thought to the things going into my body, eating pizza and some chips at around 11:00 in the morning. I spent little energy or time preparing mentally for this journey,     1:45:00  Having ridden to my friend Bs apartment with my roommate, A, I began my day by consuming what could be calculated as approximately 43-45 seeds worth of extract, seeing as each gel capsule held 0.90mL and I consumed 8 of these capsules. 500 seeds went into the extraction, and the resulting alcohol tincture totaled 85mL. Anyhow, things went smoothly aside from mild, immediate stomach discomfort from both the alcohol and the minor amount of cinnamon extract we had mixed in to the tincture.    I would like to be clear that this idea was notably ill-advised, seeing as no one else had tried the extract yet, at any dosage at all. Monumentally stupid are the words coming to mind, now that I see that on paper. Jesus. Dont try shit like this. I was relying on the intermediate chemistry skills of my friend to the tune of a dose that could easily have cause some health problems, which is never an advisable route to take. Against all odds, however, I lucked out and had quite the ride.    1:55:00   Tingling hints of euphoria begin to surface, as do very slight shimmers and waves around my peripheral vision as I am driven back to my apartment.    2:00:00   Time has become entirely meaningless in the sense that I seem incapable of determining where exactly I am on the timeline of the night. Things will remain this way for the duration of this experience.     2:45:00   Start smoking bubble hash and the visual distortion really begin to kick. I consumed what I would estimate to be around .25 grams, and shortly after, the walls begin showing ingrained, morphing geometric patterns, sometimes moving in time with my breath when I drew my attention to it.    2:55:00   I am quite heavily inebriated at this point. I walk outside to look at the cloudy sky; it was a dull, blurry gray, and patterns covered it. The designs were incredibly intricate, seeming to interact with whatever was already there rather than replacing it fitting the contours of the clouds, flinging slight color alterations over various patches. I definitely experienced the slight and familiar difficulty with conversations that seems to be inherent in a HBWR trip; however, I felt relatively lucid. For the duration of this experience I retained an impression of noticeably heightened comprehension in comparison to prior HBWR trips.    2:15:00   About this time, the experience as a whole began to turn darker I remember several moments when sitting in our living room that I looked up at the wall and my entire field of vision quickly became clouded with small, buzzing particles of infinitesimal size. More remarkable, however, were missing patches in my peripheral that looked bottomless, stretching into black eternity. It was around this time that A, the roommate, agreed to take me to get some nitrous canisters.     2:20:00   Our trip in the car was a lot to take in. I couldnt do much but sit back in my seat and watch things unfold. The colors of everything in the head shop and in my surroundings as we drove there were exhilarating.    2:40:00   After wishing love to the hippies at the shop, we were headed back to the house with three 50-packs of gas. Playing music in the car was\x85..an explosive experience. It was explosive in the sense that the lyrics, instrumentation and every other aspect of the sound heard was far more complicated than I had previously realized. Accompanying these feelings was the enticing sense that I could finally understand the musics meaning in full.     2:55:00  The whip-its ushered in a new and massively dissociating leg of the entire experience. This was the part of the HBWR trip that I would designate as the peak, and at this point I began leaving the room even without nitrous; it took maybe 30 seconds to a minute for me to dissolve into a field of absolutely mind-boggling shapes. These shapes would shift far too rapidly for me to keep track. They flipped from cartoonish in nature to static-filled and dark in an instant, nearly approaching the pace of those characteristic of an experience with DMT. The nitrous obviously multiplied the visual distortions I was experiencing, whether I had my eyes closed or not. I swam in and out of reality, dissolving entirely and jumping back to the couch. I swam in and out of reality, dissolving entirely and jumping back to the couch. Typical nitrous epiphanies, the limited memories I was able to retain from these journeys were foggy, but felt as though I could have solved every problem I have ever had in the fleeting moments of this peak state. My view always included a significant element of cloudiness accompanied with an impression of some sort of vibrational energy that I suggested to myself was an ability to see the atoms or basic particles of whatever geometric designs were presented to me.     3:15:00  At this point the first epiphany that I actually retained during the trip came to me, rather than being discovered in retrospect as most of them have been. I came out of a nitrous journey, and there was some sort of a feeling that almost seemed foreign to me even though I knew it was a product of my brain; I began to feel slightly sad, and I briefly contemplated my situation in life and the drugs I was doing and what my family would think. After about 30 seconds to 1 minute, a sharp change began to lift my mood, and soon thereafter I felt like a king. I would almost say that I began to sense god-like qualities in myself, and I felt that I had some intrinsic quality/ability that would carry me through life no matter what happened. There was immense power in the fact that I had this and no one else does. This concept came to the forefront of my mind as a truth that was already there, rather than a gift resulting from the experience.    This particular instance was the strongest case of several for true ego death. I believe that this discovery of my own god-like abilities was the reconstruction of my personal faith from whatever my consciousness had become during the nitrous trip. This ability I describe was what I believe to be the Holy Spirit inside me. I believe that Gods spirit is entwined with my spirit body because I decided to believe that Jesus redeemed my soul, and that this is the thing that I carry through life which no one on earth or anywhere else can take from me.     Another notion that was impressed upon me during this particular nitrous journey was that I was outside of my own brain; I was convinced (whether it was happening or not) that I had the ability to watch my own thoughts unfold as if they were someone elses. I briefly but genuinely convinced myself that some part of me had traveled to another place in space and/or time.    6:45:00   I imbibed \xbe of a pressed ecstasy pill, which was a Red Supreme<!-- that contained approximately 250 milligrams of MDMA in the full pill-->. We did not test these presses chemically, but due to past personal experiences along with those of some friends had tried them before and believed them to be the real deal. I had intended on consuming only two halves, but because I mistakenly believed that a half-piece of the press was only a quarter, I went for the big dog. It was a fairly pleasant surprise for me when my roommate realized there was an additional quarter missing from our stuff when he went to start his roll.    7:45:00   Music began taking on new mind-bending aspects; I was playing songs on my stereo system in my apartment and decided to throw on some South Park. The MDMA had most definitely began to take effect at this point, and visuals were amplified once again. This was a combination well worth trying, but I suspect that dangerous physiological symptoms like vasoconstriction may emerge if using seeds instead of an extract. That being said, there was no notable nausea for the entire duration of the trip, even during the MDMA come-up! My friend B did an absolutely fantastic job on the extract; I had no nausea.     10:15:00   My roommate A and I finally head out to the bar, where our friend C was DJ-ing for the night. We assisted him and the other dj, Q, in acquiring \xbd of a press each.     12:00:00   After dancing to Cs music on the outdoor dance floor out back for a while, I headed to the smokers pit for a quick change of scenery and to give myself some cancer. While there, I started chatting with Q, and our conversation was incredible. Hed had a stroke at birth, and accompanying his slurred speech and sloped lips, his hand was permanently folded as can happen with the victim of a stroke. And he DJs. Which was possibly the coolest thing I had heard in my life. Empathy was at an all-time high, as he was also rolling off the pill I helped him acquire, so I felt like I had known the guy for years.    1:00:00    Q went on to give C break, and he came right out of the gate with some aggressive stuff that absolutely made me lose my cool. The spectacular part about this point of the night was the level of understanding with which I was processing Qs voice which was permeating the set he was performing. Here was this fantastic human being who had just detailed the intricate difficulties of life with a struggle as significant as his, electrifying the air with the art that he wanted the crowd to hear. It was positively magnificent.    I am not a good dancer by any stretch, and I usually let that knowledge invade my ability to let loose when I am around people I know (eg. at the bars), but that night I was able to let go. I felt the energy of the man behind the turntables and I was loving every minute of it.     2:30:00   We started heading home, not because the music was dying down, but because A was in the process of getting lucky and I was getting tired. I also was not opposed to going home and smoking a little more hash, so we voyaged back to the apartment.    ~3:00:00   Having consumed at least a half-gram of hash, I laid down and tried to fall asleep. I want to note that throughout the MDMA experience I was able to play very vivid music in my head, which became more important when I was lying in bed. I was hearing intricate details of every song I tried to remember, and this highlighted the clarity with which I was able to recall any memory I wanted. I would estimate that I fell asleep after about an hour of lying in my bed.    The glory of LSA comes with the afterglow, so much so that I am tempted to view the trip as something to get through so that I can enjoy the vast amount of learning and healing that occurs during the hours and days following the experience. I felt, after this journey, that I had been rearranged in quite a positive manner; meditation the next morning brought about a marked decrease in the amount of time that it took me to reach a placid, almost euphoric headspace."
84266,A Taste of Enlightenment,dAneris,"Dec 1, 2015",H.B. Woodrose,"To start out with my background, I am an 18 year old male-to-female transsexual. I have previous experience with a other psychedelic drugs including LSD, Mescaline, LSA, Weed and JWH-018 as well as about ten previous trips with LSH. The previous trips could be comparable to a mixture of LSD and MDMA.    I began preparing the LSH (or LAH) by grinding up 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds into as fine a powder as possible. I then placed the powder in a cup of water and added cut up fresh peppermint leaves (due to  their acetaldehyde content), as well as citric acid to achieve a pH around 4. The mixture was then overnight in the fridge, out of the light, filtered the next day and consumed by my girlfriend and I. We each drank half the mixture. My girlfriend also took mescaline.    I was quite stressed the week before the trip, having just moved out from my parents place with my girlfriend, started university. At the time I was feeling quite panicky and upset. The day of consumption was on the weekend. My girlfriend and I planned on watching \'Alice in Wonderland 3D\' in the cinema while tripping (the version with Johnny Depp). Prior to consumption we were both relaxed, and looking forward to the experience.    T+0:00 Subtle, but difficult to place sensation was experienced almost immediately after ingestion. We then ate a vegeburger and a choc top each from burger king (we suspect this delayed the effect of the LSH).    T+0:30 Waiting in the cinema lobby, colours became more vivid, with the effect increasing slowly over time. I was still eating my vegeburger, but a light stimulation meant I was unable to finish it. I knew more food would make me nauseous.    T+1:00 The movie began. During the movie the experience did not seem to change much. The sense of vividness persisted, It felt like a weak LSH trip, based on previous experience. We had bought some snacks  for the movie, but I did not     T+2:40 Tactile sensations were disturbed. We had been eating cheetos, and the remains on my fingers gave a feeling of rawness and grittiness. There was a feeling as if my possessions and I were disordered and dirty compared to the rest of the physical environment, a feeling similar to what I have felt on LSD.    T+2:50 We left the theatre. As we started walking a sensation of floatiness and euphoria became noticeable. Empathogenic effects were felt, and a need to talk arose. Over the next half hour on the way home these effects increased.    T+3:20 As we arrived home there was a stimulating body load similar to LSA, but far weaker and far more pleasant. It was around 11pm at night, and we went out to sit at our balcony and smoke a small quantity of damiana and greater celandine, which produced a weak sedating, relaxed feeling. The effects from the smoke were overridden by the LSH, but it was enough to negate the already weak body load, and create a more relaxed tone to the trip. As we were sitting outside I began to notice fairly strong closed eye visuals. The visual noise I normally see when my eyes are closed, made up of red, green and blue dots, grew far more intense and trippy in an extremely short period of time. The dots became far brighter, larger, and the spaces between the dots became a deep black mixed with smudges of a dark green. The dots grouped in threes in a triangular, rotating pattern, and the blackness seemed to radiate in a smudging fashion. This increased in intensity until the visuals were stronger than my perception of my surroundings. The need to talk was almost unstoppable. In retrospect it would not have been good to have been peaking in the movie theatre, as we would not be able to act normally at all.     In previous trips there was frequently a sense of rotation, for instance, we\'d be sitting on a coach [bus] and it would feel as if we were rotating onto the ceiling. As we were talking non-stop (mostly about the visuals) we suddenly had a sensation that I had collided with my girlfriend, as if my mind had been launched at her. My \'mind\' then began to rotate forward. Without telling my girlfriend she told me it felt like I had just collided with her, and that she was traveling backwards, while rotating head over heels.    T+4:00 Time at this point was dilated. What seemed at least an hour was only about 20-30 minutes. As we were coming up it felt as if the LSH were catapulting us into an intense trip at an incredible speed.     We went to lie down in our bed to ride it out. It was not an unpleasant frightening intensity, as I have experienced on large doses of mescaline or LSD. However, the physical sensation of my heartbeat became quite unsettling, and I had a bit of difficulty standing. This is something that happens to me on mescaline quite often, and sometimes even on weed, where I fear my heart is beating too fast, when in reality it is not. After a short time this feeling became more manageable.     At this point in the trip we both experienced a great boost in creativity. I\'ve always been good with words, but I began spouting poetry of a quality and rate not achievable while sober. The effect was so profound that I began to test it, speaking on and on, trying to reach a point where I had to pause and think of what to say, yet the words did not stop, and were filled with descriptive language and constant rhyme. My girlfriend and I had a sudden urge to make music with our mouths in harmony, improvising and creating music with our mouths. We normally do this, but we were able to mesh far better than normal, and the music we were making was very good. There was the same drive for making music/poetry as there was to talk. There was  also elements of a psychic connection. There was the same drive for making music/poetry as there was to talk. There was  also elements of a psychic connection. For about 10 minutes we lay down and took turns to describe our changing visuals, a face made of dots, a ship sailing on a sea of shells under a sunset, and found that often our visuals would be exactly the same at any given time. We have experienced such shared feelings and images on mescaline previously.    T+5:00 We looked at the clock at this point, and were very surprised at how little time had passed. We went outside again, and around this point was hit by a massive surge of euphoria. The sensation was as if an incredibly powerful beam of energy had slammed into us, filling us with a level of bliss I had never experienced before, and certainly never with such a sense of calmness, tranquility, and clear-mindedness. This was certainly the peak of the trip. There was no need in either of our minds, no desire, we were simply existing, and were completely at peace with everything. This sensation was characterised by a flood of insight into numerous matters, ranging from the intellectual, such as my insight into the mechanics of organic chemistry, to the direct knowledge of certain philosophical concepts, such as realising that whatever happens isn\'t changed by how we feel about it, and that therefore there is no reason to feel negatively about anything, and no need to feel anything but the bliss and contentedness that we were feeling. There was a sense of non-duality between concepts of existence and non-existence. A deep, intimate connection was felt with the universe and beyond. I turned my attention to humans and all of their faults, like anger jealousy and sadness. Without any sense of betterness, judgement or pride I felt a loving sorrow and pity for the ways these ways they created their own misery. Surprisingly the visuals were less strong at this point then they were when we were coming up.    T+6:30 At this point we were both coming down. The feeling was entirely pleasant. The euphoria slowly diminished, leaving an afterglow of happiness, and the visuals faded away. My girlfriend went to sleep, and after spending a few minutes to reflect on my own I joined her. Sleeping was not difficult at all, in fact with previous experiences with lower doses we were able to sleep at the peak of our trips.     My overall impression of the trip were overwhelmingly positive. I can hardly wait to try a similar dose or even larger again. This was easily the best trip I have ever had, though not the most intense. Based on my own experience I would quantify the experience as a ++++ on the shulgin scale. The lasting value of the insights I gathered seem similar to LSD, in that they tend to fade slightly over time without effort involved in keeping them. Either way LSH is a drug I see a lot of potential in."
74667,Finding Doors in the Wall,moderngirl,"Nov 13, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"This is my third experience with this substance and with psychedelic drugs in general, apart from strong weed, which I would say has psychedelic properties. I took the seeds the same way I had before, by crunching them up in my mouth and swallowing them. The seeds I buy from a headshop are already washed and peeled. I actually like the nutty, earthy taste of these seeds. I don\'t really get nausea with most things, and I\'ve taken nutmeg before without feeling too sick.     I waited for the effects to begin by reading a novel. After about half an hour, the text on the page started to fizzle a bit; I looked up from my book and noticed shadows flitting very rapidly across the room. I went outside and noticed the plants were also dancing with these rapidly moving shadows. I then struggle to hang some washing on the line whilst I\'m surrounded by the intense light and the flitting shadows.    When I get back inside the house, I notice the room isn\'t rectangular anymore. Instead of a planned building, it seems to be a space where lines meet of their own accord. This isn\'t very disorienting or even unusual to my mind at the time. In the kitchen, the sink bowl with it\'s soapsuds soaking the dishes can only be described as perfect. Then I have the urge to look at every reflective surface in the house.    I eat a bowl of cereal and chew to a rhythm without meaning to do so. Then I drink a glass of orange juice, which can only be described as perfect. None of the over-sweet tanginess of citrus juice was there at all, it was a sweet taste without any of the bad qualities of sweet tastes, which is hard to describe. I don\'t realise that sweet things aren\'t normally so tasty until I taste something that\'s perfectly sweet. I then sit around enjoying the shadows and the light for a long time. I don\'t know how long. I sort of ignore my family in the house, but still answer them when they say something to me. I notice my conversations are pretty much normal, and I don\'t say anything weird or stupid, but Im not thinking about the conversation as I\'m talking. It\'s as if human interaction is not a priority for my mind right now, but neither is it a chore.    I go to my room and try to meditate. I practiced Buddhist meditation for a couple of years and I\'ve recently taken it up again. The light is distracting me, so I throw a blanket over my head. I have more success now with concentrating on my breathing and on being; as this is happening, I start to have CEVs. At first, I see a glowing, rotating disc changing colours from mauve to peach. Then I see the inside of a glowing plant cell, with its nucleus and chloroplasts floating around. After that, I see a castle tower against a luminous blue sky, and then I see blue cilia moving around. None of these things means a great deal to me, but I could watch them all day. After all, I was meditating on flux.     I open my eyes, and decide to begin again. This time it takes longer to see the CEVs.  The yeti appears and the expression on its face is sublime. Then I see a single beetle moving its legs in an intricate repetitive way, and then I see many beetles. Then I see a whole carpet of them crawling up a man who is made out of wood, a kind of anthropomorphic tree. The tree-man looks like he\'s in pain, and I tell myself beetles don\'t do that, ants do, but these are definitely beetles. Although the beetles never stop moving, they never get further along the tree-man\'s body, which makes me think this vision is about a state of permanent discomfort and fear. Then I see an eagle flying above all this, and the eagle has a jewel around its neck and it swoops high above the poor tree-man. This vision shows me there is more to life than discomfort and fear if you can see like the eagle, even if you\'re stuck in the position of the tree-man. The final visions were a cave of fire, a fluorescent flea, and a giant, godlike, anthropomorphic preying mantis.    I then wrote a couple of poems, which seem quite good in the cold sober light of today. I find that even when I haven\'t taken drugs, meditation and an open state of mind help me to write better.    I\'m not normally an imaginative person, not since childhood anyway. I was a hyper-imaginative child. Nowadays I write poetry, but I don\'t imagine things so much as reassemble memories when I write. I can turn on my childhood imagination sometimes, but not for an extended period. I don\'t think these visions were all strictly imagination, anyway. There might have been some element of my conscious mind involved, but these visions seemed to arrive spontaneously from some nether-region of my mind. I\'ve had similar experiences to this that have involved deleriants, opiates and skunk. I don\'t think only psychedelics give meaningful visions, but I suppose they are less physiologically harmful than most drugs. I will continue this experiment with other psychedelics, and I will probably try mescaline next."
70572,Conspiracy of Yellow,J. Alfred Prufrock,"Aug 7, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"Dose: 3 oral H.B. Woodrose (seeds)  Duration: 12 hours  Previous experience: Marijuana (2x)  Age: 16    I obtained three H.B. Woodrose seeds from John (all names are changed), a friend who had tried three and had an incredible experience. I held onto them for several months, doing research and deciding whether or not I wanted to take them. Eventually, I decided that I was ready, and I chose a school day with an ideal schedule.    9:55  45 minutes into math class, I unwrapped the seeds, chewed them, took a sip of water, held the water and ground seeds in my mouth for a full minute, and swallowed. They tasted bitter and earthy. I tried not to think about what I was doing or what a poor decision I was making. When I swallowed the seeds, I felt as though I had doomed myself and that I had made an irrevocable decision. There was nothing to do but wait. Math continued for 20 minutes. History was next.      10:15  History went by slowly. I was mildly nauseous and mildly nervous. About midway through class, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach, as though someone had kicked me. It quickly went away. I was glad that I hadnt had anything to eat and that I had drank so much tea and ginger ale. When class ended, I put on my headphones, played the Phish album Billy Breathes, and walked quickly to the library.    11:20  At the door of the library, I met Patrick, my closest friend. I was glad to see him and I immediately felt more comfortable. We went downstairs to a study room.    11:30  In the study room, I tired to explain how I felt, but I was very inarticulate. I was not feeling the effects yet, but it was clear that Patrick thought that I was, and I felt as though each little thing that I did was being scrutinized and attributed to the seeds. This was a feeling that lasted for the entire day. Patrick and I were planning on taking a public bus downtown after school ended, so we spent a while looking at maps and bus schedules. A few other friends of ours stopped by, which was very stressful. I did not want to talk to them.      11:55  For several minutes, I had been fixated on the window, probably because it was the most exciting thing in the room. I asked Patrick if the window was vibrating, and he said that it wasnt. It felt so clichd, asking a thing like that, which delighted me for some reason. I moved closer to the window and realized that it wasnt vibrating. The leaves on the trees were quivering in the wind, but they were all moving in synch with each other in a mesmerizing pattern, and the movements were rippling forwards through the glass. It was a subtle visual, but it wasnt like anything I had experienced before. I had fun experimenting with my glasses for a minute or two, putting them on and taking them back off.    12:00  Patrick had to go to class. He got up to leave, promising to check back in an hour. I got up as well because I wanted to go to the bathroom. As soon as we left the study room, the effects hit me full on. It was something about the change in setting. My head felt completely altered and I was completely high and euphoric and giddy. Each time I lifted up my foot to take a step, it felt as though the floor sank away beneath me, racing back up too meet the sole of my foot as it touched back down. I could not keep from grinning, and it seemed to me that I had a secret that nobody around me at the carrels or in the chairs could possibly understand how I felt. I went upstairs into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. My pupils were large. Urinating felt bizarre   it felt as though the fluid was falling out of my body. I stood in the bathroom for several minutes, feeling slightly overwhelmed. I decided to venture outside into the fresh air.    12:15  The air felt wonderful against my skin. It was that time of spring when daffodils and forsythia are in bloom, but everything else is still barren. The green of the grass formed a sharp contrasted against the blue of the sky, interspersed with patches of yellow blossom. Several people I passed were wearing yellow, and it seemed to me as if there was a conspiracy of yellow. A teacher approached me and asked me if I was going to send her something that I had promised to complete. I said yes and quickly moved on. My face and neck began to feel warm, and I could tell that I was flushed. I walked into the commons area of my school, but it was overpoweringly loud and it seemed as though the faces on the posters on the walls were leering and smirking at me. I retreated back to the library, still feeling enormously happy and bizarrely altered.    12:30  When I returned to the study room, I found that the door was locked. I could still see my backpack through the window in the door. I walked to the library desk and calmly asked the librarian to unlock the room. I remember saying its strange that the room is locked several times, but the librarian didnt seem to suspect anything.      12:35  I ate some crackers and fruit gushers. The food looked bizarre on the table and felt strange in my mouth. My face felt numb and tight.    12:40  Back in the study room, I put my head down on the table and listened to Speak To Me, first song on Dark Side of the Moon. It was more of an experience than a song   each moment seemed important. About 45 seconds in, I was interrupted by my friend Phoebe, who entered the room. I hadnt yet seen her that day, and I was very happy that she was there. She was wearing a bright yellow coat and her hair was pulled back. I had never before seen someone so beautiful and perfect. Her beauty wasnt entirely sexual, but it wasnt purely aesthetic   It was really just an amplification and complexification of the attraction that I already felt towards her. There was an intense femininity about her. She smiled at me, and I felt as though the smile meant a lot, as though she had communicated all of her thoughts about the situation to me through her smile. I started telling her about my morning, but she was sort of freaked out by the whole thing. I looked into her eyes to compare our pupils. Hers were quite small. I felt as though she understood certain things about me better than anyone else did. I wanted to put my arms around her and kiss her. I was going to ask if I could, but then I realized that she probably wouldnt want to. Under ordinary circumstances, my feelings towards Phoebe are quite confused, but in this state, it seemed as though the confusion was unnecessary, and that it would be easy to explain anything that I wanted. But then I realized that I couldnt, that she wouldnt take anything that I said seriously because I was altered. And I didnt want to say anything that I would regret. After a few minutes, Phoebe left and I went back to Pink Floyd.       12:50  The first few songs of Dark Side seemed to stretch on into eternity. But after a few minutes, I turned off the music and went upstairs to look for John, the friend who gave me the seeds in the first place. I met him coming into the library. He was with Abby, his best friend, and I trusted her. The three of us went back to the study room together.    1:00  Patrick returned. I was thrilled to see him. Looking at him was comforting, and I felt as though I could see all of our memories together at once just by seeing him. My thoughts were racing, and I felt as though all of the situations around me were more multifaceted than I had ever realized, but I could think about things from many different angles at once.     1:10  This was the worst part of the day. Random people started coming into the small study room until it was crowded and loud. There were many people supporting me, which was a good feeling, but I also felt scrutinized, foolish, childish, and annoyed.    1:20  I left for English class.    1:30  English class. I arrived before the teacher. Lauren was waiting for me at our usual seats. We had talked the day before, so she knew my situation. She had agreed to help me get through class. She looked angelic. I sat down and looked into here eyes. Her pupils were much smaller than mine. Its going to be ok, I told her. I went to the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror but forgot to look in the mirror. When I returned, the teacher still hadnt arrived. Time seemed to drag on. The classroom barely felt real. Eventually, the teacher came in and class began. Lauren kept looking at me and smiling. Her hair was wavy and rippling and beautiful. I took the two rings she was wearing off of her hand and looked at them, thinking about them intensely. I felt as though I understood unfathomable truths about the nature of rings. I started focusing on my water bottle, looking through the water at my pencil. Light was wildly refracted, and the bottle seemed like a lens into non-reality. The tip of the pencil was bending and undulating, even when I touched it. I still felt crisp, clear, and euphoric. I made several comments during the class, all of which seemed brilliant. Later, I was told that they were barely coherent. By the end of class, I felt as though I had stayed up late into the night thinking about my life and had figured everything out. Not in a way that I could write down or explain, but in an abstract way that could only exist in my mind. When I closed my eyes it was still dark, but it was more easy than usual to imagine colors.    2:30  This is the only part of the day that I do not remember properly. Apparently, Lauren walked me to athletics because it was clear I wouldnt have made it there on my own. She also reports that I asked her if she ever wore both of her rings on the same finger, and when she said yes, I told her that she was so cool to do a thing like that.    2:35  I remember being in the locker room with Patrick. He wanted me to go running with him, but I decided to stay inside and listen to music while walking slowly on the treadmill. I became very immersed in the music, and I could hear all of the instruments independently    3:30  School ended. Patrick and I walked off campus to the bus stop. The altered feeling had left my head. I felt very floaty and tranquil, and it seemed as though I was having the most wonderful day of my life. Each moment was a good moment. I felt lucked and blessed to live the life that I had. Sitting on the curb with Patrick, we had an introspective discussion about the experience that I had had. Our discussion lasted long into the bus ride. We got off and walked to a Middle Eastern restaurant where we ordered shawarma, tea, and Turkish delight. The food was incredibly good and I was very hungry. I felt completely relaxed, and I was not worried about work or anything else. When were finished, we tried to find a bus to take us back. When Patrick and I do things as a pair, I am usually the organizer and the mover. I get stressed out about little things and I always make sure that we know exactly where we are going and how we are getting there. Patrick just drifts along, happier and more chilled out. Unfortunately, we were both sort of drifting along at this point, so finding the right bus took ages. While we were waiting for the bus, I saw people from all different backgrounds and walks of life milling about and waiting with us, and the full range and structure of society seemed clearer than it ever had.    5:40  We arrived back at school. Patrick took a late bus home and I went to a lecture that I had to attend. I sat next to Phoebe and gave her the food that I bought her. Someone said that I was such a good friend, which made me feel very good. The lecture was dull, but I wasnt bored. I took 4 pages of notes that turned out to be completely incoherent.    7:30  Phoebes mom came late to drive us home. I was very quiet in the car. I felt as though I was coming down from a marijuana high, except I felt much more clearheaded. I had a brief conversation about school with Phoebe and her mom.    8:00  Arrived home. The first thing my dad said was you look sick and tired. I took a warm shower, put on my most comfortable cloths, made tea and toast, sent a few emails, hugged my mom for a very long time, and went upstairs to sit in bed with my blankets drawn up around me and read one of my favorite books. Completely incapable of doing work.    10:30  Almost back to normal.    11:15  Fell asleep."
78092,Re-Experiencing My Life,Baby,"Jun 19, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"I prepared my Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds by soaking them in cold water overnight. The seeds expanded and some of them cracked open, the following day at 11:30am I decided to take them. Now I\'ve heard they cause nausea but I was really hungry so I ate some Banana Bread (not a good idea). I was soon laying on the floor feeling extremely sick. This only lasted about and hour and a half though.     The back of my neck soon began to tingle and feel really heavy. It was hard holding my head up. I also became extremely calm and starting to think about the universe. I was laying in front of a sliding glass door watching the rain fall. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I could feel love, I loved the Earth and the Earth loved me back. I loved my family and friends. I loved everything. I could feel it. It hurt so good. My music was playing softly in the background and I was inspired to write down my thoughts and feelings, this is what I wrote:    \'Life is real. But it\'s unknown. It\'s not about wanting. We\'re blinded by what we don\'t need. Life isn\'t for wanting. It\'s for letting go. Love is all there is. It\'s unknown. So we forget what it is. We don\'t just let it be. We try to contain it. Love knows no limits. Love is never wrong. Like burning ice eating your body. Love is all you need to know. Just Be. Just Live. Just Live, don\'t question. That\'s the problem, we ask why. Why doesn\'t matter. Just Be. Just Live. Just Love. Be Free. Know no limits. Love has no limits. Feel. Love. Be. This life is learning to let go. Learning to Love. Only to Love. No Love is wrong. We wonder why. Don\'t. Just Be. Just Love. Fly Away.\'    After I wrote this down the words on the page turned into butterflies and flew away. I was soon unable to hold my pen so I layed down again. I was extremely fascinated by my hands. My skin looked exactly like the skin on an elephant. I soon had to use the restroom so I got up and somehow made it there. I was then distracted by the mirror. My face wasn\'t my own. So I grabbed a hand mirror and sat in the hallway. My face looked like it was made of silly putty. I could grab my skin and stretch it out. My eyes became large and I could see myself in them. I could see myself looking at me. My smile became demonic, my teeth sharp and lips cynical. I kept thinking \'Is this what I look like when I\'m having sex?\' I must of looked in that mirror for over and hour, watching my face move.    All of a sudden I began to melt. I could feel my body melting into the floor. Into the wall, I was melting into the universe. Everything was connected. I was a part of everything and everything was a part of me. I wanted to lay by the window so I tried to get up. It hurt to walk. It seemed like I could feel every cell in my body, it hurt too much to walk. So I just stayed where I was and drifted in and out of sleep. I though my dog was a dragon. I ended up dreaming I was a lion and a tiger. I didn\'t just dream it though, it was as if I was a lion, and I was a tiger.    When I woke up I was feeling a bit better, at this point I was about 5 hours into my trip and I was about to reach the peak of my experience. I began to relive my life. Starting as a young child I went through my life. Every memory, even memories I had forgotten all came back. But I wasn\'t just remembering them, I was reliving them. I wasn\'t a young women laying on the floor tripping out, I was a child living my life. Living in my childhood home. Smelling the woods I used to play in. Feeling every emotion I had ever felt. My father was extremely abusive and I remembered everything he did to me. It gave me insight on why I always feel so scared in life. I won\'t go into details on what I remembered (besides, it would take to long) but I got to reevaluate my life and understand my childhood.    After that life changing experience I began to slowly come down off my trip. I turned on my music and I could feel it. I could feel the beat, I was part of the music. I looked outside and the sky was coming towards me. If I had wanted to I could of reached out and touched it. Colors were everywhere. Everything was so beautiful. The Earth is an incredible place, I realize that now more than ever. The Earth\'s alive and she\'s beautiful. That night I went to sleep and had vivid dreams, the next morning I woke up extremely tired. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. These seeds are extremely powerful and not to be messed around with. I wouldn\'t call them a \'party drug\' They give you insight on yourself. I didn\'t have \'fun\', I had a spiritual experience. If you want to see inside yourself you should take these, but be warned they\'re amazingly potent and they\'ll knock you on your ass. They\'ll change your life forever."
78215,Insanity: The Fear of Losing Control,Azathoth,"Jun 18, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"One Tuesday morning, at around 1 o\'clock in the afternoon, during the Easter holidays, me and my good friend decided to try out H.B.W. It was the perfect moment to try out our first psychedelic experience for we were staying in a friend\'s country house along with a bunch of other people we knew very well and far away from the stress and paranoia associated with big cities. I had about 3 days to stay there so it was all fine and dandy and I figured 3 days was plenty of time.     1 PM. So as I said, one Tuesday morning me and my friend (let\'s call him \'A\') each dropped 10 grains of H.B.W into coffee mugs. We filled the cups with about 2 fingers of pure water (and not tap water, because its chlorine destroys LSA, or so I\'ve heard) and closed the mugs with a solid surface so as not to let any air escape. I\'m pretty sure \'A\' did the bastardly deed of stealing one of my grains, but it would not change anything to the oncoming effects he later experienced. After leaving the grains in the water for about 20 minutes, we both quickly drank the water (which had turned yellow) and thoroughly chewed on the remaining grains. We had not eaten anything before taking the grains so we stupidly thought we could eat afterwards: A Ate a few strips of bacon and I ate a few chips.    1:30 PM. We walked out of the kitchen into the living room. The inexorable nausea was coming quickly after a few minutes and I felt the mild pain in my stomach, but nothing too harsh, though \'A\' suddenly felt drowsy and needed to lie down in one of the unoccupied beds upstairs. I sat down on one of of the living rooms chairs while some guys were watching television and waited for the effects to hit me. I had no idea how much time the onset or the coming up were going to take. Nothing happened for about an hour so I believed the grains were not working. Sadly, I had taken every grain I bought, and I felt slightly bummed that this experience was wasted so easily.    I decided to check on \'A\' lying down on one of the beds upstairs. He seemed to be sleeping, but after examining him for a few seconds he muttered that he felt like he had taken a sedative. He told me he wasn\'t experiencing any visuals either open eyed nor closed but his thoughts were racing and his imagination had a raging boner. I felt even worse that I was feeling absolutely no effects (except the nausea) even though he was, as he had taken precisely or at least approximately the same dose as I had.     This bad feeling turned into a physical bad feeling and I raced to the bathroom only to stay there 20 minutes waiting to puke, but nothing was coming out. I came out of the toilets and \'A\' had left the room. He was downstairs smoking a cigarette and talking to people. I decided to start watching a film to forget about my lack of luck. I watched \'Sal\xf3 or the 120 days of Sodom\', Pasolini\'s masterpiece, with my friend for about an hour and a half. After a while I started to feel pretty heavy and weak: thus I believed this was due to my lack of sleep and excessive alcohol abuse over the last few days so I climbed into my bed and relaxed. I stayed there for a while with my eyes closed as one of my friends watched the film with \'A\' who had finally decided that his trip was over.     3:50 PM. Progressively, my imagination was running wild, which is usually normal in the moments before I fall asleep, though something was different this time. The nausea was slowly creeping back. I felt that my legs were getting heavier. I stretched out and it felt so good. Suddenly, the need to vomit surged out of my bowels and I was running to the toilets upstairs. My friends, still watching the film, were laughing at my violent and amusing change of state. I lifted up the toilet seat and puked like a robot about 5 times. I thought it wasn\'t going to end, but after a short while it did. I became dizzy, and I thought it was because of the pressure I had put on my head.     I was wrong. I looked into the mirror and, lo and behold, my pupils were as big as Elton John\'s anus! My face was constantly morphing, and with a maddened childish glee I ran downstairs to proclaim that the grains were finally working, after 3 hours of digesting! The effects came on slowly. I sat down in the living room on a chair facing the colourful patterns of the opposite wall. I stared at this banal thing for a few minutes until I noticed that the wall was sliding and the patterns were meshing into each other, as if this bed of purple and blue tulips were being blown by the wind. I did not marvel at this change of perception, I simply acknowledged it and took it for a sign that the grains effects had barely started coming. I stood up and left the living room for the garden.    The sight that I beheld was incredibly glorious! The rain had left a coat of dazzling diamonds on the explosively coloured flowers of spring, while the wind shook the great trees that looked immense ad noble. After a night of rain the sky was clearing itself and the clouds were patchy and incomplete. I looked to the sky; the clouds were titanic angelic ships sailing across the Klein blue of the spring sky. I stood there like a fool with my mouth open wide in astonishment until \'A\' came out and told me in a calm and gleeful voice to sit down. I took a chair; the few drops of rain that had found a way onto it were shining with a blinding brightness. To the eyes of my friends I seemed hyperactive and excited as my dilated eyes darted around the garden like bees. One of my friends started talking to me. It took me a while to grasp the flow of the conversation and I was constantly asking him to please repeat the sentence. After a hard time of trying to understand what the bloody hell was being told to me I gave up listening for it seemed a waste of my time to listen to seemingly inane gibberish during a psychedelic experience. I was fearful that this might lead to them thinking I was blatantly ignoring them, but they understood my condition and I started roaming the garden looking for more eye candy.    The clouds were starting to cover the sky again and the light that managed to shimmer through those holes in the clouds was astounding. For a minute, my weak sense of perspective led me to believe the clouds were right there in front of me, and the light was shining right through the trees at me. I was overjoyed. I decided to climb once more into my bed and enjoy the closed eye visuals. I looked around the room: the patterns on the bed sheets around me were writhing like snakes and falling into each other, the small shelf on the wall had books coloured so that they stood out a lot and the room was lit in a dim red light (which is actually how it normally is). I was experiencing a pleasant sensation overload: the TV outside sounded as if it were around me, as did the people speaking in the living room as well as all the small sounds of movement, doors slapping and a ball being kicked. Sounds echoed abruptly and seemed to emanate from my own mind.     7 PM. My eyes were darting around very quickly, for there was simply too much to comprehend. Thoughts were emanating from various objects around. The effects were becoming stronger and I was losing myself to the inane flow of my own thoughts and the amazing CEVs I was experiencing: golden-velvet human eyes in triangles over a blue sea, eyes on top of thrones, dolphins raping humans (disturbing). Soon enough, this trip was turning into something I couldn\'t quite control. The incessant flow of my thoughts was accelerating to the point of incoherence and I was worried for my sanity. From time to time, in the glimpse of a second I was able to tell myself that this was just a drug, that my family has never had accounts of schizophrenia, that I was overreacting, but none of these phrases could slow down the unstoppable force of insanity I was experiencing. For an hour, I lived in the hell of what is described as schizophrenic psychosis. Time was eternal: I was stuck in this madness for ever. I tried listening to My Bloody Valentine or Ozric Tentacles, music that usually calms me, but the lyrics of the first made absolutely no sense and the latter\'s progressive rock was dissonant and giving me the creeps.     After a long while I managed to hang on to the thought that this was all temporary and it would change again. And it did. I was still insane but I managed to walk up to the toilets upstairs and stare at my constantly morphing face. The black and beige granite on the floor was swirling like a maelstrom and distorting itself to the point of becoming grey. I looked out of the window: two of my buddies where doing some Krav Maga in the garden, and as they jumped around they seemed to be made of a extensively stretchable material. I came back into my bed, and being unable to object or even talk coherently, some friends walked into my room and drew stuff on my face with a UV marker. I was desperately trying to get them to help me, but they started leaving the room and I couldn\'t speak. \'A\' walked in and approached his head to my face and stared at me. His face was taking on completely different dimensions and his typical Joker smile made him look terrifying to my poor tripping mind. He left, and once again I was alone.    8 PM. I mustered up the courage to see what was going on in the garden. The house was empty, for the guy whose house this was got the impression that I might turn berserk and thrash around the house. I stepped into the garden, and as some people watching the two guys do Krav Maga turned their heads to see what I was up to, I started feeling paranoid and believing they were scared of me and didn\'t want to talk to me. My incoherent thought process had since left me, but the feeling of paranoia was nearly as overwhelming. Then it started raining. I helped them pick up their equipment for the fighting and came into the living room. The setting sun looked like fire on the horizon. Sanity was coming back to me and I was increasingly feeling better though sad that I had had such a horrible experience. I crashed into a comfortable sofa and looked around: the wall seemed to be morphing as well, and holes were being dug by invisible forces into the yellow paint. The colours of the television were crazy and extravagant, as were the people acting out the soap operas. \'A\' sat beside me and asked me if we could jam, as I was sure he noticed my sadness. I tried playing along with him, but it was hard. It was like learning to play the guitar all over again. Thankfully, this activity kept my mind off my bad experience and as we played a few bluesy numbers I started feeling much better and euphoric. I felt weird coming down (slightly) back to reality, as if my eyes were shrinking (which they were). I finally got up, and started fully enjoying the hallucinations. The flowers on the wall were morphing into these sleeping, violet human faces. The sensation overload I was feeling early on was turning into this feeling of being encircled by loving friends, indifferent to my current state but who would be there for me if anything went wrong. It\'s strange, but this sensation overload is nearly exactly the same experienced by Raoul Duke in \'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\': this state of confusion, where the immense mass of information received is strangely interpreted. I was starting to move around like Robert Plant much to my friends\' and my own amusement.    9:00 PM I left the living room to look at the garden again. I think that at this point the effects were wearing off but still very present. The stars were very shiny. So were the puddles of rain on the round and dew on the flowers. My friend comes out to talk to me; I now fully understand what she\'s saying but she still thinks I\'m in the \'ignoring\' mode. We stepped back into the house just when dinner was served. Sitting at the table was like a new glimpse into the terror of insanity: the table is rocking, eating is hard as I seem to no longer posses any saliva, watching people talk is hard because their face twist into perverted grimaces. I start feeling bummed again, but then I once again tell myself that this is just one last wave of negative effects from the drug. After a good dinner I sit in my room and start enjoying the last of the sensory overload until \'A\' walks in and starts talking to me, asking how it was like, if I was still on the bad trip. At this point, the feeling of anxiety tied to insanity had vanished. I realised the trip was nearly over.    What followed was the end of the trip, spent at a small table where a circle of my friends and me smoked hookah. A great sense of comic awareness was dawning and I found myself laughing - I have a hard time expressing my amusement - at the stupidest of \'A\'\'s antics, the girl beside me being drunk and thus depressed and silent and the other Brazilian guy talking about who knows what that is supposed to have to do with a philosophy based on an opposition to a negative aspect of life.    I slept very well and the next day, even with just 4 hours of sleep, I felt more fresh and open-minded than I had ever been before. Cleaning the house was fun, as was watching \'The Phantom Menace\' and watching the clouds outside that still seemed to be humongous.    Overall, even with a bad trip on my first experience (I\'m sure that it was tied to the unusually large first dose of about 10 grains), I felt this has been an enlightening moment. I take more interest in colour now, though my interest in music has slightly decreased. Patterns on walls or anywhere take on more significance. My imagination has increased in potency and I still manage to perceive quite lucid visuals when I close my eyes these days. I\'m definitely trying this again or LSD, and I\'d like to recommend it to people who feel good in their own skin and who can find a safe and familiar place where to take the trip."
70892,Nightmare on Repeat,Mr. Kite,"Dec 10, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'ve had two great experiences with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose prior to this one. Both times I used a simple water extraction. I did not prepare myself at all for this experience. I was in the process of performing a slightly more complicated extraction, and was waiting for the water to evaporate. I grew impatient and decided to try a sublingual dose. I smashed 13 seeds into small chunks, after scraping off the coating, and put them under my tongue with some sugar. I was having a very difficult time keeping them under my tongue and decided to just swallow them, since I had experienced no nausea at all in my previous experiences. This was a very bad decision.    About an hour or so later, I started to feel minor effects. I had to write a letter to a college honors program that I had been putting off, but in this state I thought very clearly and wrote it quickly and much better than I would have normally. When I was done, I went to my room to lie down. I was feeling generally happy at this point. I started a cd and lay down in my bed, waiting for the seeds to take full effect.    At some point I fell asleep, I don\'t remember much before falling asleep, only that prior to sleeping I felt no nausea. This was certainly not true when I awoke later that night. I have no idea how long I slept. I lay there for a while, feeling the nausea increase with every movement. Finally I decided to go to the bathroom and attempt to throw up. As I stood, I felt the vertigo hit me, and dizzily made my way to the bathroom. I struggled for a bit trying to lift the toilet lid. After unsuccessfully trying to vomit for a few minutes, I returned to my room to try to sleep. When I got back to my room, I saw my alarm clock, unplugged and on the side of the bed opposite the wall. I have absolutely no memory of unplugging it.    I lay down on my bed watched as my room bent and twisted. I felt like the room was spinning around me. I eventually closed my eyes and tried to sleep, but sleep would not come. I then entered the worst state of mind I have ever experienced. As I lay on the bed, endlessly tossing and turning, discovering that the room was spinning, finding out that my alarm clock was unplugged, I realized that I had experienced this before. I eventually went back to the bathroom to throw up, but it wouldn\'t happen. I would finally give up and go back to my room, rediscover the alarm clock, and start my cd over at song 12, because song 11 skipped.    I repeated this cycle too many times to count. I though it would never end. I began to hate the visuals and wish for death, because I thought it was the only way out (I later discovered that at some point while I was writhing on my bed, wishing to die, Albert Hoffman actually did die, which creeped me out to no end. may he rest in peace). Eventually, I saw the sky outside lighten. I felt incredible joy and incredible terror at the same time. The sunrise meant that time was real, and I was going to get out of this. Until then, I had no sense of time because my alarm clock was unplugged. At the same time, I felt terror.    The sunrise meant that my mom would be up soon, and I was still high. I heard her going into the bathroom by my room, which meant she would be waking me up soon. I decided to avoid that by quickly walking to the other bathroom and taking a shower, hoping that the shower would help me come down. When I got to the bathroom, I finally resolved to stick a finger down my throat and just get the poison out of me. I managed to vomit several times, which temporarily reduced the nausea, but didn\'t bring me back down at all. As I looked in the mirror, my eyes looked like giant black holes, barely rimmed by light blue (which is the absolute worst eye color for someone as fond of psychoactives as me). I was in the shower for something like 20 minutes. I still had no concept of time, but I seemed to be in there for a while, but the water was still hot, so 20 minutes is my best guess. I felt much more grounded as I emerged from the shower, but, to my horror, my pupils were still enormous, and I new I couldn\'t avoid my mom. When I ran into her I acted utterly exhausted and constantly rubbed my eyes so she wouldn\'t see my pupils, and told her I wasn\'t feeling well, which was true.    I then discovered that it was only 6:00 and I didn\'t need to get up for another hour and a half, so I returned to bed and fell asleep almost instantly. When I awoke, I quickly made my way to the bathroom to look in the mirror, and my pupils were back to normal, but I still felt horribly sick. I spent the morning lying down, wrapped in a thick blanket. I tried to eat some bread in hopes that it would settle my stomach, but I could only manage a couple bites. I filled a giant mug with some cereal and headed to class (I couldn\'t stay home because I had a test). I was really worried about driving, but I had gotten to the point where my head was spinning and I was nauseous, but no longer inebriated. I surprised myself by driving very well, without any problems.    I continued to feel nauseous throughout the day, and had some interesting closed-eye hallucinations, although they could easily have been connected to my lack of sleep rather than the seeds. As I was walking to class from the parking lot, I closed my eyes for a few seconds without realizing it. With my eyes closed, I continued to see what I had been seeing, but the world was ripping itself apart. Suddenly I opened my eyes, which is when I discovered I had closed them, and everything was normal again. This happened several other times throughout the morning.    I finally got home about 1:30 and slept until 5:00. I awoke feeling much better, with the nausea having almost completely subsided. I learned a valuable lesson, that is, DO NOT EAT THE SEEDS PLAIN. I am very, very thankful it\'s over and I didn\'t cause any long term damage, or get caught. I was extremely lucky."
84481,Useful Healing Tool,8bitshaman,"Dec 10, 2012",H. B. Woodrose (Hawaiian Strain),"It is approx. 9 AM on a cool February morning. My mind is clear, yet stressed by some vague sense of anxiety. Resolved to overcome this elusive sense of foreboding, I decide to take a journey of self-overcoming and healing.     At 8:30, I begin chewing and swallowing the seeds; by 9:00 I am finished.     For the next several hours, I sit in my apartment living room contemplating the world beyond my window. I appreciate the micro-community surrounding me, and start to contemplate the wonder of human civilization.     Around this time, I fall into a deeper state. I walk from room to room, as if searching for something. Standing before a tibetan tapestry, I marvel at the rich interplay of colors, shapes and patterns.     At this point, I decide that I would like to experience life outdoors. I carefully make my way to a nearby park. Sitting in the open, I somehow feel communion with the land itself. It is almost as if my presence here is absolutely essential, as though I am part of an intricate scene from a jigsaw puzzle.     Then, as if a thunderbolt strikes my mental state, I realize that I have unfinished business. I rush back to my apartment to find my cell and then return to the park. At this point, I feel uncoordinated and am prone to wandering aimlessly. I settle down beneath a pair of tall, towering evergreens and make my call. The call itself entailed a long-overdue promise/apology to an old friend. The conversation was lucid, and with great resolve.    I smoke a couple of cigarettes and take in the surroundings. Once again, there is a great sense of being one with the earth, the trees and the sky overhead. I could feel the life of the trees embracing me, the solidity of the ground underfoot, and the light of the sky breaking through the branches high overhead. We were all as a family; it was as if the elements of nature around me took on very real and tangible identities.     I leave, feeling blessed by the great majesty of nature. I return home; yet there are differences. The rooms now seem very vast, yet very finite. The next moment, the rooms seem very small, yet infinite. It all depends on the perspective.     Then all at once, something happened. It was as though that rational part of my mind which asserts itself as a true and fixed identity crumbled into dust. I could see myself in my mind\'s eye independent of attraction or aversion. I realized that my failures and anxieties were no more concrete than the ego that manufactured them. Yet, that ego was gone.     I sat in the encroaching dusk to bask in this revelation. Several hours later I decide to turn on cable news. Clips from the state of the union were being shown; yet the audience was vastly different from my previous recollection. The congress would rapidly desaturate before my eyes, transforming into a simple color scheme. Additionally, the members of congress would blend into three or four people. In other words, the many would merge into few. There would be many thousands in the audience; moments later there would be only a handful.     Realizing that the daily news made little sense in my non-ordinary state, I decided to sleep. As I drifted off, vibrant geometrical patterns scrolled in my mind\'s eye as if an organic screensaver."
73250,Dumbarse Double Doses,McA,"Dec 10, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"[Erowid Note:  The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid\'s \'heavy\' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    I\'ve been meaning to transcribe this from memory for a while.  Well, in my neverending quest to transcend reality I discovered that not only are HBW seeds cheap but they are effective and easy to get my hands on.  I bought 50 off of Ebay for a reasonable price and had them rock up in my letterbox about 3-4 days later. I could barely contain my excitement at getting my mitts on these isoergine laden seeds of the gods and the pantheon of the soul.  Having scrupulously read the entries for them, I decided that as an experienced psychonaut with uber willpower (ha!) a good starting dose would be 13 seeds. I placed them in a plastic bad, smashed them into a powder with a hammer and then finely ground them in a mortar & pestle. To this I added about 45ml of water and the juice of half a lemon and let it sit in the dark for about six hours. When I believed the LSA/ergine extraction was complete I poured the slush into a glass, added some water for volume and downed the lot.   Well, despite being excitable and having prepared well for the experience I only noticed a small amount of Mayan-Paisley hybrid patterning on the carpet, and was totally overwhelmed by fatigue less than two hours after consumption and was unable to stay awake. I passed out and awoke 12 hours later covered in sweat after some reasonably vivid dreams involving floods and me running for my life.   This, I decided, was wholly inadequate for my needs (and wants). So two days later, on a Saturday, I, being the intelligent individual that I am thought \'Well, why not simply double the dose and go balls to the wall? It can\'t be that strong\'. This was the decision that resulted in me being in total kill-me-now-please-god mode for the next three days afterwards and I swear to Kali and Vishnu that I will never do such a recklessly stupid act again.  The same procedure was followed, except I pulverised 26 seeds (following the same preparation method). After leaving them to sit in the dark while I went out and did some errands I returned, dumped my shopping in the cupboard, put on some Nina Simone and sculled the lot with a quick soda chaser. Things went smoothly for the next hour or so; I had some powerful nausea but a quick spew fixed that - for the time being. I don\'t have the best recollection of what happened but I\'ll give you the gist of it.  +1:30 - Fast-onset strong drunk feeling, followed by dissociated and super duper random thoughts. Couldn\'t concentrate or even remember what I was just thinking - or doing.  +2:00-2:30 - The shit has hit the fan. The carpet seemed to be extruding itself in pulses, or waves. Objects in the room such as the television swelled and deflated at an extremely uncomfortable pace. The horizon line I had firmly established to avoid nausea (the windowsill) decided to tilt 80 degrees from left to right in rapid succession. With seconds of notice from my belly, I ran to the toilet and performed the most sickeningly powerful chunder I have ever done. Imagine gastroenteritis spew multiplied by 20. I remained hugging the bowl with my eyes shut for what seemed like hours but was in fact only about half an hour.  +3:00-X:XX - After I stumbled away from the toilet and washed my mouth out with listerine I managed to hobble around the house in total bewilderment. Any pattern, any pattern at all be it the spackle on the walls, the tiles in the kitchen, the fabric on my jumper - it all started moving inwards on itself like hundreds of black holes had suddenly appeared and demanded a sacrifice of cheap, shitty materials. Coupled with the extreme nausea I still felt I realised that I had gone way, way overboard and was going to be paying for it in a big way. I recall falling over on the grass on the back lawn and curling into a foetal ball for at least several hours (it was dark when I managed to stumble back inside), spasming violently from stomach cramps and throwing up sporadically all over myself.  +X:XX-X:XX - I dragged myself into bed, covered in my own stomach acid and for several hours laid there, curled up wishing I would die but simultaneously debating whether or not to call an ambulance to avoid that seemingly very real possibility. By the grace of Yahweh I did eventually fall asleep to imagined sounds of metal being cut with some kind of power tool, and other things I cannot clearly remember.  I awoke the next day with no visual effects but to my chagrin I had shat myself and also vomited all over my once-prized Sci-Fi book collection. When I went to stand up I realised that my knees and ankles felt like they were on fire, literally burning white-hot. I screamed, freaked right the fuck out and ran into the shower to douse myself in cold water. For the rest of the day I attempted, in between violent vomiting fits and what I can only describe as excruciating pain in my leg joints, to clean up the filth I\'d left plastered everywhere but I didn\'t get much done.  Repeat symptoms and fast forward two days; My knees and ankles had swollen to almost double their original size so I finally gave in to the unbelievable shame and went to see a doctor. The doctor examined my legs, looked in my ears and eyes and told me that I had a case of acute Gout. I didn\'t believe him - Gout was what pissheads and old women get, right? Wrong. Being an inquisitive and not too gullible man the doctor asked me what I\'d taken, and being honest (and in too much pain to lie) I told him a shitload of HBW seeds. He told me (in kinder words) that I was a fucking idiot and that thanks to my quest to get off I had probably done some maybe temporary, maybe permanent damage to my kidneys and that I was now essentially pissing into my legs because my kidneys weren\'t working properly. Un-fucking-believeable.  Fast forward two more days (and a shitload of ibuprofen later), mid-week. The ibuprofen (and much Gatorade) has worked wonders on the gout and lucky days, I\'m in the hospital having a blood and urine test performed and experiencing the joy of getting fluid taken out from under my kneecap (it hurts like you can\'t imagine) to determine whether or not I\'d really fucked up my kidneys or whether it was temporary. Apparently they measure the uric acid content in your knee joint fluid, urine and blood to get an indication of whether or not you\'ve done your dash.  Fast forward to a few days later, maybe early the next week. With an unbelieveable sense of relief I discover that no permanent damage has been done, and that my problems were caused most likely by three things:  1) Being an idiot; 2) Taking way too many HBW seeds; 3) Not drinking enough or any fluids during my 2.5 days of nauseous hell.  That was about three months ago. I am not a religious person but the feeling of imminent death I felt was almost enough to tempt me to beg YahwehChristVishnu for salvation.   Don\'t do what I did. It\'s demented. I still freak out a bit when I think of what the seeds, and my idiocy, did to my body and mind. Vomit, vacated bowels and violent body pains. Dum der dah dum dee.  I hope this all makes sense and that you get the gist of what I am trying to express."
66644,Creamy Garlic Dressing,Terun,"Apr 9, 2012",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"What I am about to relate is without a doubt the most intense, spiritual, and visual tripping experience I have ever had. Let me start with my background. I have been experimenting with psychoactive drugs now for over three years. The substances I have experience with include Marijuana, Alcohol, DXM, Ecstasy, Kratom, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Salvia, Amanitas, and Zolpidem. This fateful night a group of three friends with varying experience with drugs decided to take eight Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. The setting of our adventure is a medium sized college campus. I am a long time viewer of the DV, but this is my first post.    It was 8:30 pm on a Monday evening and I sat in my evolutionary biology class eagerly awaiting my chance to leave. For I knew that when I arrived back on my dorm a group of friends and I were going to take LSA in the form of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Finally the class ended and I headed back to my dorm. Outside it was a perfect fall day, the sky was slightly overcast and the weather was perfect.    Upon arriving back at my dorm, I discovered that my three friends M, S, and K had already eaten the seeds forty minutes ago and were starting to feel the effects. S handed me the bag with the seeds and hastily I took eight seeds out. I started to peel the brown skin off of them, as advised by many websites. I popped each seed into my mouth one at a time, chewed, it, and let it sit on my tongue for about 30  40 seconds. They tasted fine, kind of like giant sunflower seeds. After ingesting all the seeds we decided to head outside so M and S could have a cigarette. The seeds were beginning to take a hold of S, and his stomach was a little upset.    We went outside to my dorms courtyard and sat on a bench. M and S began to smoke cigarettes and K and I sat next to each other discussing the various aspects of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds and our expectations for the night. After the cigarettes were done we decided to head over to a different courtyard to attempt to find some marijuana, because we knew if we waited much longer we would not be able to score any.    We meet up with our friend S, who decided not to trip with this night because of an early class the next morning. Luckily, he had some marijuana he wanted to sell. At this moment, about 20-30 minutes after ingesting the seeds I noticed a little lift, a change in perception, but not too much and my stomach began to feel a little uneasy. K and S were already descending into their trips, unfortunately Ss stomach kept bothering him. We came up with a plan to go to the Student Center so I could get some money out of the ATM, and then we would go to our favorite spot to smoke, chill, and relax. This spot is a trail on campus that it pretty much designed for smoking pot. It is a cement trail, with all night lighting that runs behind a beautiful lake with fountains in it.    We started our journey to the trail, and as we went the effects became stronger. I felt distant, happy, and excited. I was still at the heightened stage, as I was not fully tripping yet. Different parts of my body would for a while go numb, and then in a sudden rush of energy and euphoria they would become sensational again. M and K both reported the same sensation. The only way I can describe this early feeling is as if different parts of my body was having minor orgasms.    After a quick trip to the ATM and an unsuccessful attempt by S to purge himself in the bathroom we arrived at the trail. As we got closer we saw a group of 5 or 6 people taking big rips out of a bong at our usual spot. After a quick chat we proceeded to the next bench were we started to smoke. Smoking marijuana definitely helped with my stomach nausea and brought me up even more. After a few bowls both groups merged into one big group as another group of smokers came along. It was very surreal, as an impromptu pot smoking party was taking place right before my eyes. Someone took out a blunt and started passing it around. Everyone sat their chatting and smoking for about a half hour. At this point the effects of the marijuana drastically overshadowed the effects of the LSA, but not for long.    An hour into the trip, a bunch of people wanted to go get some Chinese food and the Chinese restaurant down the street. So there we went, a huge caravan of tripping, stoned people to the Chinese food restaurant. When we got to the restaurant I saw this girl that I really do not like at all. Fearing that she would either decide to come with us, bring my trip down, or steer it in the wrong direction I abandoned the notion of getting Chinese food. Instead I went next door to a brand new pizza place. This was where the LSA really began to take a hold of me.    I walked into the Pizza place and ordered a tuna salad. The owner then asked me what dressing I would like. Without thinking I said creamy garlic because thats my favorite salad dressing in the world, but I have only ever found one restaurant that has ever had it. Unexpectedly he said sure, and I was overcome with happiness. The owner of the pizza place and I then had a heart to heart about how he is trying really hard to get his business up and running. That was what lead my trip down and awesome route. He went into the back to prepare my salad, and I sat their alone in a brand new pizza place. Now this pizza place is a very upbeat and cheerful place, so that only enhanced my mood. Every color, every painting seemed truly alive. It was like I was seeing the true essence of the world for the first time. I got my salad went outside to be greeted by S, K, and M. The rest of the big group had left to go to someones apartment. Not wanting to be confined to the indoors we decided to head back to the trail.    On the way back to the trail S remembered that he had to talk to someone who was back in the courtyard. So we decided to make a detour and head back their first. I was truly in a great mood, I felt at peace with everyone around me, with nature and the world. I got it in my mind that I wanted to spread that peace to others. All I could think about was giving, and helping people. I quickly went into the campus convenience store, where I proceeded to buy 10$ worth of discount candy and snacks for everyone. Then, with my salad, and snacks we headed back to the courtyard for a candy picnic.    When we arrived back at the courtyard we encountered our other friends D, L, and E. L and E had just taken their first doses of DXM and were having a great time. I offered everyone in the courtyard a bag full of candy, and we proceeded to have a candy picnic. This was about 1.5-2 hours after ingesting the seeds, and I at that point thought I was peeking. The world was beautiful I was in a great, caring, and giving mood. I was also having slight open eyed visuals of dancing colors and patterns. Little did I know that this was only the beginning and the night and my trip was very far from over.    This was when our group started to split. S, who was having a very different trip then the rest of us, decided to go off to chat with a girl. Before leaving us, S and I talked, and he said he was descending into a more negative trip, but he was learning a tremendous amount about himself. So it was down to just M, K, L, E, and D. We chilled in our dorm room for a bit, listened to some music, and generally tripped in the dorm for about twenty minutes. At this moment, the trip started to get extremely intense. I was having more and more open eyed visuals, as was everyone else. L, E, and D decided to head back to their dorm room, so now it just M, K, and I. K wanted 20 minutes of alone time to think life over so M and I headed outside.    We ventured to the side of a building and sat down in the grass. The world was spinning, colors danced in the sky and we both felt wonderful. It seemed as if the whole world was at peace, and we were in such a brilliant mood. This was the first time, M and I realized we were both having truly wonderful trips. After a few minutes of quiet contemplation we proceeded back to the dorm to pick up K and once again venture to the trail.    Walking to the trail was a truly breath taking experience, the whole world and everyone we saw was illuminated, peaceful, and tranquil. We arrived at the bench and found the trail empty. We packed a bowl and smoked it very slowly as we were in no rush. Time stood still, we felt as if we were at the top of the world. This was when we hit the peak / plateau of the experience, about three hours after taking the seeds. Our imaginations where multiplied exponentially. I saw everything I could imagine, it felt as if I had complete control of reality. We sat on the bench for what must have been an hour, and finally we got up to walk. K, wanted to go back so headed back to the dorm where we parted ways with him. Now, it was just M and I, tripping harder than any of us have ever even thought possible.    Back at the dorm, we decided that being inside was a bad idea and that since nature had given us this wonderful new perspective, we ought to honor it by spending most of the night in it. I decided to pack a backpack with supplies for our journey. At this point my mind was racing, and I scrambled around the room gathering, bread, blankets, chalk, pencils, notebooks, and water for our journey. At this point I was drenched in sweat so I decided to take a shower. Every sense of mine was on fire, sensation of every kind felt amazing. I grabbed an ice pop out of the freezer and proceeded to take the most amazing shower of my life, while eating and ice cold ice pop. The water coming out of the shower head looked unreal, I could feel each individual drop hit my body and run down myself, the sensation was multiplied tenfold. After emerging from the shower I felt like a new person. I brushed my teeth, got dressed. At this point I purposefully left my wallet, id, and cell phone behind. I was leaving my former self behind, I was a new person. M and I proceeded once again to the trail.    At this point we were tripping harder than before, it just kept getting more and more intense. I had complete control of reality it felt, my imagination had merged with reality. This time we sat on the ground and took the nature in. We had seen all of reality break down in layers throughout the night until it was just us M and I, two roommates and long time friends, sitting alone in the woods. At this time we were convinced that all of eternity, and all of human history had culminated in us. We felt on top of the world, we felt enlightened. The night was so beautiful next to a lake, all of nature was around. We could hear every insect, and animal. Sitting there smoking, drawing, eating bread, and drinking water we discussed life. We broke down all of life to its utter most core. I delved into my own persona, I talked to what I thought was my id and superego. While the world around me swirled with anything I could image.    I almost had complete control of my hallucinations. Long forgotten memories from my childhood returned to me in utter brilliance. I realized so much about my life that night. I thought about the past and what the future could hold. For a time the two of our thoughts merged in a sense, we were both thinking the exact same things at the exact same time. To us it seemed as if no one had ever been so deep, so utterly connected to each other. I could remember so many dreams from my past, I felt as if my waking self and my dream self had merged into one. Time stopped, it did not matter one bit. I dont know how long we sat there. After a good amount of time we returned to the dorm, and each of us went our on our own journeys while we slept.    The next day, I was still slightly tripping until noon, and I had an incredible afterglow that lasted well into the following day. I learned so much about my life. This experience changed my life for the positive. I have a much more optimistic view on life now, and I feel that I can finally express myself. For example, I would have never written a trip report before this, I did not have the confidence that I now have in myself.    Also, I have a much deeper appreciation for nature now. My diet has changed since my trip, in that I now eat a lot healthier, natural, organic food. Salads have become a staple part of my diet. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, which will be hard to beat for me. I will undoubtedly try these seeds again, but only after a long break to thoroughly think through what I experienced. I advise anyone who is curious about LSA and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds to treat them with the utmost respect. Do them in a safe, secure environment, where one can easily go outside and enjoy nature."
92833,Bliss Before the Madness,Maiki,"Jan 26, 2012",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"My interest in psychedelic plants and herbs began after having the opportunity to experience ayahuasca on a beautiful mountain terrace in the South of Spain.  After a night of understanding and appreciating the beauty and collective genius of the systems that form the natural world I wanted to find a way to explore that transient state again.     Ayahuasca is the only psychedelic I have tried before this H.B. Woodrose experience although I have used MDMA and some of its analogues (mephedrone, methylone, 6-APB). I also drink and smoke marijuana regularly. After some research I purchased a pack of 7 H.B.W. seeds from a local head shop. They were fairly cheap at \xa35 considering the power of the little things. I decided to take the seeds on a night where I was alone and would be safe without disruption.    To prepare the seeds I took a small sharp knife and began scraping away the thin coating on the shells of the seeds as I have read this will reduce nausea. I then put 3 of the seeds back in the bag they came in, sealed it and crushed the seeds with 2 steel weights. I had last eaten 5 hours before injesting the seeds.    T+0: To injest the seeds I put all of the crushings from the bag in my mouth and chewed them for a few minutes to release/absorb the LSA and then swallowed it. Within 15 minutes I became nauseous so I poured myself a glass of ginger beer and added extra ginger extract to it. (I read that if youre feeling ill ginger can help relieve your stomach.) This seemed to help as my nausea stopped quickly after drinking it.    T+0.30: As the nausea wore off could feeI a slight buzz in my stomach and spent the first hour relaxing in my bedroom listening to music and admiring the sunset outside my window. I was so relieved that the nausea had passed so easily that I decided to injest a further 2 seeds as sickness was my main concern.    T+1.00: The first real effects began in the second hour as I felt an almost MDMA-like sense of wellbeing but with less stimulation. The euphoria progressively intensified as I sat in awe of the view from my window and the tune from my speakers. At this point I was so impressed by Hawaiian baby woodrose that I injested the final 2 seeds.    T+2.00: I was now experiencing a full body and mental high, similar to that from MDMA but I was more sedated. It was like combining the highs from MDMA and marijuana where you take the warm, glowing euphoria and combine it with that mellow mood feeling as you relax within yourself. At this point I decided to roll a small spliff and smoking it felt incredible, completely different to a normal smoke. This definitely heightened the feelings of euphoria and wellbeing with the music and the orange glow from the sunset sounding and looking more beautiful than ever before. No visuals had started at this point but the world had a definite tint to it; colours and shadows seemed more pronounced.     T+3.00: By this point I was lying down glowing with euphoria. I was listening to Bon Iver and have never been so lost in the groove before. Closed eye visuals were setting in and I felt like I was composing my own music video in my mind with patterns and colours flowing in time with the music.     T+3.30: Full open-eyed spectral patterns were forming which led me to think about the cosmos, energy and matter. I found that I could think of myself down to the raw materials of matter and energy and how these are exchanged with the rest of the universe making me part of the full universal system instead my usual human societal role. I then decided that that is what psychedelics can offer; instead of leaving you with the usual combination of human instinct and cultural mannerisms you enter a state where the normally hidden and mysterious philosophical questions become more visible and important to you.    T+4.00: Visual hallucinations continued to grow stronger and peak as the night progressed. As I lay down I could feel the euphoria draining out as the glowing feeling was soon gone. In my increasingly confused state of mind feelings of self-doubt set in and I began to regret eating the 4 extra seeds. I can remember feelings of restlessness and emptiness as I was just left experiencing intense visuals without the euphoria as my mind couldnt stay on logical thought. This caused some anxiety as these bizarre ideas although I dont remember exactly what they were made me worry about myself.    T+5.00: Peak effects continue with same sense of emptiness. I found that the best way reduce the anxiety was to keep the music playing and let the music guide the trip instead of lingering on worrying thoughts in your head. Although I could still enjoy the music it was never again as brilliant. What a few hours earlier had been perhaps the cosiest bed Ive ever rested on now felt awkward and out of place as the restlessness continued. I was looking forward to coming down as the strange new world I was visiting was making me question my sanity.    T+6.00: Effects still peaking as I decide to roll another spliff to see if I can get rid of the unpleasant feelings and bring back some euphoria. It worked and the action of smoking and the taste of the marijuana are just as satisfying as the last spliff. I found that as I got up to roll up and became more proactive I could focus my mind more clearly and enjoy the experience as after I had finished smoking I lay back down I could feel some anxiety set in so I decided to remain sat up and did my best to enjoy the experience.    T+7.00-9.00 Effects beginning to weaken but by this point I am getting sick of my scattered thoughts which I am struggling to control. I smoked another spliff which was again very pleasant. After a while I feel back in control of my mind but I am left with a feeling of empty-headedness. I fell asleep roughly 9 hours after taking the seeds (5AM).    T+14.00 I wake up and the first thing I see is a slight ripple flowing across my wall but no visual effects follow after that. I feel dazed and confused and could still feel the LSA having some effect on my conscious until mid afternoon. Despite this I could still function perfectly well all day without much of a comedown.    I would like to take the seeds again but maybe just 2 or 3. The full peak effects just lasted too long and I struggled to focus my mind and fully explore the spiritual aspect of the trip. If I do decide on a similar dose I dont think Ill do it alone as this will probably help with the anxiety. The experience was totally serene during the beginning of the experience when there was a lower level of LSA in my system so I think that a smaller dose will keep the euphoria without letting in the madness. I would enjoyed marijuana while on H.B.Ws, it brings on a feeling of bliss weed has ever given me by itself. I understand the subjective nature of taking psychedelics and that since this was only the second time I have experienced visual hallucinations I know in time I could learn to control myself and focus on the beauty of it all. However the peak effects of werent as beautiful or inspiring as that of ayahuasca and on ayahuasca my mind was totally free to explore anything and everything at a rate I could never match whilst sober. Hawaiian Baby Woodrose would sometimes restrict and occasionally trapped on my mind thoughts and emotions that worried me. Still, it was an experience that was at times peacefull and others spectacular which makes it all worth it."
71014,"Wonderful, but Uncomfortable",Mind For Rent 9,"Jan 20, 2010",H.B. Woodrose,"Some brief background: I am, at the time of writing, 19 years old university student, and roughly three days after experiencing my first trip on any substance. I had held an interest in psychedelics for quite a few years beforehand, though really I hadn\'t heard of any aside from LSD and vague \'magic mushroom\' references. I had heard of ecstasy too, but didn\'t realise it was a psychedelic until recently. My main interest in these substances, aside from the obvious intriguing properties and effects on the human mind, were the possibilities of relation to mystical experiences, mind expansion, and creativity (and \'normal\' recreational use, of course).    I had recently been talking with a friend over MSN and he linked to some pages about Salvia Divinorum (we had discussed psychedelics briefly before, so he knew of my interest). Previously I had never even considered that psychedelics might exist which were legal to possess, and this sparked my research into various legal-to-posess substances, ultimately leading to buying some of these seeds online. Mine were bought from a vendor who guarantees no chemical treatment has been performed on the seeds.     I initially tried a sublingual technique, using 7 seeds, but since I lacked the tools to properly grind up the seeds as required, it didn\'t work very well. I held what felt like vomit in my mouth for 15 mins before spitting the disgusting mess out. This was an almost complete failure- I experienced extremely subtle CEVs- mainly wavy patterns and a suggestion of points of light if I covered my eyes. In fact these were so vague they might just have been wishful imaginings. The next day, I decided to just go for it and deal with the nausea. I\'ve tried to write my best account of taking the seeds, and the subsequent trip below.    5:00 PM - After making sure I felt happy in general, and ready to try the seeds, I put 4 into a mug half full of water, guessing that 4 is probably about right for me, this being a first time, and microwave this for 45 seconds on high, to soften them enough to chew. After fishing the seeds out with a spoon and allowing them briefly to drip dry to cool them down, I chew each one thoroughly and swallow in quick succession. The taste is neither wonderful or particularly dreadful. I retreat to my familiar room, and put on a playlist consisting mainly of my \'upbeat\' tracks, with some extra psychedelic tracks thrown in for good measure, don my headphones and wait.     All times that follow are rough estimations in retrospect and from occasional glances at the time.    6:00 PM - At this point the nausea has started to kick in. I feel like I need to vomit, and spend some time crouched over the toilet bowl. Ultimately, I don\'t vomit now, or at any point in the trip, though at times I feel like I really want to. A slightly worrying effect aside from the nausea is that my throat feels very slightly constricted or swollen, but since it\'s not stopping me swallowing or interfering with my breathing at all, I decide to leave it, at least for now. As it turns out, this abated completely before the end of the trip, so I\'m not totally sure if it was due to the seeds or not, but in any case this might be cause for hesitation in taking them.    6:15 PM - I\'ve given up on vomiting for the time being, and have returned to my room. I\'m starting to think that I\'m not going to get any sort of trip, just nausea, and that this is a waste of time. I consider eating an extra seed or two but decide that it\'s probably best just to wait and see. After a while however, I start to feel a noticeable mood lift, and a brief bout of laughter ensues. This is where I can definitely say that the noticeable effects beyond nausea were taking effect. Nausea intensity renews a few minutes later, so I return to the toilet bowl. I start to notice vague and somewhat fuzzy, but clearly genuine OEVs- clusters of concentric circles around the middle of my vision. They look more or less like the fuzzy noise behind the eyelids at this point, and OEVs don\'t really get much stronger than this throughout the trip until quite near the end. I check my pupils in a nearby mirror, and they\'re noticeably dilated.    7:00 PM - The mental and body parts of the trip have really kicked in by now. I feel very happy and content. The music is directing my CEV\'s, which are mostly sort of vaguely human forms grooving with the music, in a swirling liquid way. I decide that I should try to dance, and stand up for the first time since the trip really kicked in. My body feels strange, slightly lightened and a physical inebriation kind of like that of alcohol as well. When I start to dance, I find myself moving in strange ways, just putting almost every limb through every twist I can. My body feels really fluid, and when I close my eyes, I see visuals vaguely resembling myself and the strange twisting dance I\'m performing. These visuals twist and swirl as if they\'re appearing on a viscous fluid surface which is being stirred. I feel incredible and strange. I sit down again, though I get up to dance again several times more, with similar results.    I feel quite restless, and can\'t stop moving at this point, so I was constantly grinning and grinning! Things felt different, and really good. LSA apparently increases tactile sensitivity, and this is what was happening to me. I kept just running my hands through my hair, and over my body, and just feeling various surfaces, like the stucco-ish walls, wood, my bed-sheet covers... At one point, I tried licking them too, to see how it felt. Every breath, when I focused on them, felt wonderful, and I felt so pleased and giddy just to be alive. When I was washing my hands after using the toilet, the water flowing through my hands felt strange and wonderful.    The nausea remained with me, it\'s intensity oscillating between discomfort and \'please puke\', but gradually diminishing. I had a strange discussion with a friend over MSN, where I\'d kind of seized on the idea of a potato (which had been mentioned earlier on, whilst I was still relatively sober and waiting for the effects. Don\'t ask ;)). I realised what a beautifully complex thing a potato is, and then it sort of seemed bigger in my mind, and I found myself thinking about how the entire world seemed sort of like a potato, in a way- a strange notion I normally wouldn\'t come up with, or at least not in the kind of detail I did in this case. Cramps begin to occur in my legs if I bend them for too long, and I spend a while massaging and stretching gently to counter them. Throughout, there\'s a strange sensation of seeing two worlds when my eyes are open- things look pretty much normal, but there\'s still all the strange stuff going on with it in my head which I can feel at the same time.    Time from now to the end of the plateau is pretty difficult to relate to any specific happenings, so I\'m not going to try. The following happened from probably 7:30-8:00 PM until roughly 9:30-10:00 PM, but that\'s about all I can really say.    The pronounced mood lift has faded somewhat, though I\'m still feeling very much happy and content for the rest of the trip- just not as intensely as the initial brief lift. The body and mental effects are much the same, but the CEVs have intensified and become more varied- Along with the swirling, I start to see morphing fractal patterns, and weird corridor like structures which look somewhat like H.R. Giger works. A few Picasso-esque forms also appear at times. When I stand up, I feel like I keep going upwards for a second or two after fully straightening up, and at one point I actually feel as if I\'m taking off, before I move and destroy the illusion. The sound of someone moving bottles out in the hall sounds somehow strange.    After a while, my eyes start to ache, mainly because I\'ve been looking at a computer screen for quite a while. I go to lie on my bed after turning on the bedside light and turning off the main one. The CEVs continue, with things like spirals of blurred red and green spots, things with too many outlines (they look kind of like those cheap 3D effect books where each picture has a black outline, a red one, and a blue one, except these have red and green instead). A couple of rainbow blobs have become noticeable. When I open my eyes things look normal, but when I close them, the room remains as an afterimage, which is quickly swirled out of shape. I feel peaceful and content, and amazed at what\'s happening to me, and the world in general. I also have the strange sensation that I\'m actually more awake than normal, and in tune with things.    After a while, I realise I haven\'t checked for the \'tracers\' effect yet, and wave my hands around in front of my face, discovering that I am indeed experiencing mild tracers. I find this quite an interesting effect, and spend some time just letting my arms and hands groove in front of my face. After a while I find that I\'m getting brief OEVs every time I open my eyes. Things gain what I can only describe as extra outlines, there\'s a bright blue glow in the gap between door and frame, and I get a kind of mind\'s eye overlay of the geometric patterns on, or branching off the normal objects in the room.    Old memories come and go, including some dream fragments that I\'d forgotten until then. I get an interesting thought effect when I start looking at some photos on the net- I see a picture of a country road, for example, and suddenly a whole bunch of associations are kicking in, and I\'m seeing the road as itself, but also feeling it as a whole bunch of other roads, and countrysides that I\'ve experienced in my life. It\'s hard for me to adequately describe this feeling- the appearance of the road never seemed different, just how I was interpreting it. Sometimes I lie down for what seems like several minutes, and come back to find it\'s only been about one. Some straight lines, like the edges of the room, seem bent. After a while, I feel my mind start to return to a more normal state, and the visuals declining in intensity. Maybe half an hour after beginning to feel the intensity decline, I feel fairly close to baseline again, though there are still noticeable CEVs and brief but subtle OEVs, which are mainly minor distortions.     10:15 PM (I\'ve checked the time again at last) - I leave my room and go to join my flatmates in the flat\'s kitchen/living room/common room. I notice a few more odd things- the same strange associations I\'d experienced earlier were still happening, and I was seeing my flatmates in a new light. One struck me as looking kind of like the guy off Star Trek with the pointy ears, another like some sort of tall gnome (neither of these associations is particularly accurate though). The images on the TV were subject to the same strange thought process, and the floor in the corner seemed to be bent at about 45 degrees off flat. After another half hour I was basically down, aside from subtle CEVs and the occasional brief association. I watched a film (which admittedly still gained some additional strange qualities from the remnants of the trip), and went to bed by about 2:00 AM. My pupils were still dilated at this point, and had returned to normal by the following morning. I had no trouble getting to sleep.    The next day I still felt very slightly trippy, and very much tranquil and positive. The nausea had gone, and I was able to eat normally again. The trippy effect remnants had worn off by afternoon, but the positive feelings persisted, and even now I feel unusually positive about things (I\'m usually a pretty calm and happy person, but this seems to be even more so than usual though), and generally more in tune with the world. I wouldn\'t claim it\'s been a total life turn-around experience or anything, like some people experience, but it definitely seems to have had fairly minor but real and lasting positive effects.    Overall, the experience was really enjoyable and positive, but I\'m not sure that I\'ll repeat it for a while, and probably not with these seeds, mainly because of the toxins found in them. Sure, I wasn\'t even sick, but that\'s probably just down to luck."
57788,Symbol of My Love,Entheogen23,"Jun 20, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"Hawaiian Baby Woodrose trip report: My first real psychedelic experience    Friday May 18th, 1990    At 5:15pm I ingested eleven (11) agyreia nervosa (Hawaiian baby woodrose) seeds (ground to powder in a coffee grinder and stuffed into gelcaps) and sat down to continue reading Huxleys The Doors of Perception.  Being on an empty stomach, I began to feel the effects within 20 minutes: slight weakness, increased awareness of shades of colors, and a fuller understanding of Huxleys writing.  After another 15-20 minutes, I had finished the book, and felt some nausea come on stronger. I knew that if I felt that I had to vomit, that I should as it would cleanse my system allowing the good effects to come on.  I felt hungry, and thinking the nausea would not get much worse, I decided to eat some rice-a-roni leftovers.  I realized after eating it that it would make me much more likely to vomit, so I went into the bedroom to lay down to rest. After this, there is some question to exactly what happened and in what order, but as I write this (the following day) I will try and relay it the best I can.      Our kitten came in and hopped up to play with me, which filled me with great happiness. She tried in vain to suck on a nipple on my neck (a pimple), which she often did to moles and other skin bumps.  This time I allowed her to do so, because I know she was happy.  After a while, I began to see shapes in the wrinkled blanket, and fancied the smooth, soft curves of the cloth.  After laying and musing on the intricate folds of the blanket, a feared event happened, the phone rang.  I dont know why I was afraid it would ring, perhaps I feared one of my parents or my boss would realize I was high.  I picked up the phone, and it was my friend M.  She asked what was up, and I told her P (my girlfriend) and I were going to a movie later.  I told her about the Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, and she was excited that I was finally trying a psychedelic.      I got off the phone and lay in bed, staring at the shadows on the ceiling, and was enjoying this very much.  I no longer felt nauseous, and the drug was allowing me to re-experience subtle feelings from previously in my life, perhaps childhood: love, joy, wonder, and amazement.  After enjoying this little trip, I got up and went back into the other room and opened the door.  The sunlight beaming in overwhelmed me with its brightness and glowing essence.  I felt light and airy as I walked around the apartment, enjoying the moment.     I sat down on the futon to listen to some music.  The first thing I listened to the Beatles Yellow Submarine.  The lyrics and music to take on new meanings, and I began to see mosaic-like lines and patterns in the clouds in the sky.  By the time Its all too much came on, I was engulfed by the experience around me.  I had also began to worry the phone would ring again, as M said she was going to call back to check on me.  However, I was too involved in the classical portion of Yellow Submarine, and so I was not too concerned.  The music took me on a psychedelic journey into the notes of the music itself.  When I closed my eyes I would see twisting, multi-colored patterns that moved to the music.  When I opened my eyes I would see amazing patterns in the sky and clouds out my window, and could see birds flying gracefully in the wind.    I wished to become a seagull, but when I found myself in the birds body I got queasy from the motions of flight.  I could stare at the ceiling and see hundreds of little dots, red with yellow or blue outlines.  It seemed like I was sitting for at least 3-4 hours, or more like 3-4 days, or weeks, or months!!  I couldnt tell, but when I looked at the clock, it had been under 2 hours that I had taken the seeds.  Amazing!  I was interrupted in my state of bliss by the phone.  I got up to answer it, it was M again. She asked how I was feeling.  I told her I felt eternity in one hour.  She was impressed the effects were so pronounced for something legal, and told me to listen to some music.  I told her I had been listening to The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.  She said to listen to The White Album or Janes Addiction.  I told her how Hendrixs Third Stone from the Sun and how it had Jimis voice slowed waaay down, but now I could understand what he was saying!    I began to feel sick again, from standing up I guess, so I asked her what to do.  She said it was the body high brought on by the strychnine in the seeds.  I told her I felt like throwing up, so she let me go.  I think at that point I sat back down to listen to listen to Hendrix more, but the end of Third Stone from the Sun took me on a freaky, oozing ride that made me feel worse.  I then got up and went to the kitchen sink and threw up all of the rice I had eaten, and threw up 3-4 times, which seemed in slow motion.  I felt a bit better so I drank some water and sat down to listen to more music.  This time I put on Abbey Road, because I thought the sentimentality of listening to it.  It was the album P and I were listening to a lot when we fell in love.  I dont recall listening to the music that much, just sort of a haze with blips of the Beatles music thrown in.    Some time into the album, the phone rang.  It was my friend S.  He wanted to know if I wanted to go to a party.  I told him about the HBWR seeds, and he said Wow, far out or something to that effect.  I laid down on the floor, as I felt the nausea coming on again.  I got off the phone, only to have the phone ring and this time it was L, Ss roommate, and she asked me where to get some of the stuff I was taking.  I told her I ate them all, and that I had to go lie down.  I listened to Abbey Road until it got to I want you (shes so heavy) after which I became wracked with fear and pain.  I had slowly sunk from heaven to hell and had finally realized it.  I longed to hear Golden Slumbers so I could have something to remember P with.  I felt the fridges of a hell-like experience creeping up on me, and by the time Here Comes the Sun came on, it was too late, I was in too deep.    I felt like I needed a savior, something to help me out of this bad trip.  I realized it was a little after 9:00pm, so little more than 4 hours into the trip, but damn it seemed like eternity!!!  I then put on some calming new-age music, Ray Lynchs Deep Breakfast.  Maybe Ray could be my savior, until my true love P arrived home.  I desperately tried to hold onto the music, to let it carry me to safety, but as the Beatles sang Its all too much, for me to take.  I lay huddled in the fetal position, clutching the warm blanket for safety, but I realized I needed to find something, anything, that symbolized Ps and my love.  I looked at the floor, and the walls and all of the things that reminded me of P, but they all glared back at me in a cold, barren stare.  Yikes!  All of these things were just physical things, objects of no real meaning.  I longed to see Ps face and feel her warm skin.  I then realized how someone could attach and feel so much love and strength in a mere object, they had to have some trust and courage, which everyone has to some extent, and that such things as a crucifix or other religious or spiritual symbols can serve as an effective archetype for someone to hold onto in times of fear or doubt.  I then realized that there was no symbol, or object that effectively represented P and the love I felt for her.    The kitten had now awoken from her catnap in the bedroom and come to see why I was moaning on the futon. She wanted to play! The love that P had given this little kitten gave me a tiny shred of hope of making it out of this experience.  I tried to let the music soothe me again, but it didnt help.  I looked at the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs on the wall, and it melted and twisted with a frightening grimace.  Even Bob cant save me now, AHAHAHA!!.  After what seemed like hours, or days, the phone rang.  I feared it was my mom, but it was P!  Hearing her voice caught me off guard but also gave me hope Id make it.  I told her of my hell I was experiencing and I how I needed her. She said it served me right (for being so foolish, doing it alone, etc) and she was a bit angry we werent going to make the movie.  I was scared that if she got angry, that I would either die or go insane!  I told her I loved her, and she said she loved me too.  This gave me more hope.    She said she would be home in 20 minutes, but I knew this might seem like hours to me, so after I got off the phone I went and filled the bathtub with warm water, and laid in the water, letting its warmth chase away the bad thoughts and feelings.  There I lay, naked (physically and mentally), shivering from some mind-manifested chill, the music of Ray Lynch music blasting in the air.  I had died.  I had died and been reborn, at least in some way.  I had seen the edges of nirvana, and the depths of samsara or hell.  After the seeming eternity of 20 minutes or so, I heard the door unlock.  It was P!  My love, my sweet love!  She was here with me now, so it was all OK.  She was still angry about the movie and she was tired, but I told her that I needed all her caring and understanding, and that I would never do something like this again.  She was a bit hesitant and resistant, but I could feel she cared for me, and that is all it took.    Approx. 10:00pm:  I lay in bed, still feeling queasy and tripping slightly.  P called me in to drink some eat and drink some juice, so I got up and upon eating I felt better.  We sat at the table and talked (that is I talked my head off!) and I told her about the experience.  Her glowing essence and warm smile filled me reassurance and joy. She took a shower, and then I told her more about how I journeyed into my ego, and saw some of the problems and fears I had.  I felt like I had overcome some of my fears, and even thought that I may have overcome my allergies to the cat (which I hadnt).  After that, I tried to read some, first Alan Watts, then Tom Robbins Even Cowgirls Get The Blues, but I was too dizzy to read very well, so I fell asleep to psychedelic, op-art, fractal-like cartoons in my head.    AFTERWORD (the next day):    The next day I felt tired, yet very relaxed and introspective.  I realized that part of the reason the trip may had gone bad, aside from the large dose and nausea, was the fact that the sun had gone down and the darkness of night outside might have had a negative effect, based on my fear of the dark as a young child.  I knew I never wanted to repeat the experience again, at least such a high dose.    AFTERWORD, PART DEUX (16 years later):    In retrospect, that powerful and traumatic trip so long ago seems so foolish and typical of someone my age at the time (early 20s).  I can laugh at it now.  I took too large a dose, by myself, with no prior experiences at all.  At the time, I actually had read a bit about Hawaiian baby woodrose, and knew a dose of fresh seeds could be fully psychedelic with as few as 4-8 seeds (and these were very fresh seeds, grown in Hawaii), yet I took 11 of them.  I guess I figured, hell, these are legal, how powerful could they be!  Also, the book I read about them in (Legal Highs by Adam Gottlieb) mentioned the LSD experience with extreme lassitude.  I didnt really heed the extreme lassitude part!  The bad parts of this trip came back to me on nearly all of the other psychedelic trips I took for years later (LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, even high doses of marijuana).  I even swore off psychedelics for about 10 years, and only recently in the past 2-3 years have begun my explorations with them (DMT and ayahuasca mostly), in a much more cautious and respectful way.  In some ways I am thankful to have such a learning experience, but wish I had an experienced trip sitter with me that day, as things would likely have not gone downhill so badly.  Live and learn!"
70591,Elixir of Transcendence,Dedalus,"Jun 16, 2009","H.B.Woodrose, Calamus, Kava, Chasteberries & Cannabis","This experience took place at a drive in movie theater, and various parking lots; it is important to note that I was not driving on this night, as my good friend \'S\' offered to take the wheel.  The preparation was simple and legal: I scraped and crushed nine Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds with a pair of pliers and a sheet of paper and sealed the course powder in two capsules; the Kava was from a health food store, and consisted of pure, untreated root powder; the Calamus root and Chaste Tree Berry arrived in the mail already powdered, and all these encapsulated.    HBWR: 9 seeds, in 2 caps  Calamus: ~5 grams, in 4 caps  Kava: ~6 grams, in 5 caps  Chasteberry: ~3 grams, in 2 caps    Also I took two capsules of crushed Milk Thistle seed; these have no psychoactive effect, but are good for cleansing the liver and blood of the toxins which cause the trip.  I have been experimenting with these, and other herbal consciousness-expanders for two years; this formula has been achieved through trial and error, and I am very satisfied with this latest iteration.    The HBWR contains LSA, which is the plainer cousin of LSD; for me the effects always come on as a vague set of bodily sensations, starting in the stomache and heart area, then flowing up into the eyes, and back of the head.  The feeling resembles a psychic/erotic tension, a combination of bodily and perceptual heightening; it was hard to notice, and harder to describe, during my first experiments with LSA.  The Calamus acts as a stimulant, and has a spicy taste which reappears in frequent burps.  Kava is a socializing drug which brings out feelings of empathy and a kind of outward-flowing consciousness.  Chasteberry contains a chemical which binds to the brain\'s Dopamine receptors, making for a more pleasant, euphoric experience.    This night the experience built to a peak which I had not encountered before; while the movies played across the screens I became more relaxed and euphoric, while nausea was held easily at bay with Cannabis inhalation.  My visual effects were close-edyed at this point, and they amounted to a seperate, entirely private movie playing on my eyelids.  I could visualize anything, in perfect clarity, and see it before my third eye in High Definition Omnicolor; for a period I had control over the images, and I played with various ideations and fantasies, until I came upon a startling and terrifying notion.    I considered the experience of the last man on Earth, what he might experience on his dieing day; suddenly it struck me that, at the moment at which the last man/woman on Earth dies, he/she will not be aware of the fact.  Since the extinction of mankind assumes a breakdown in communication, the news of Man\'s extinction would not be known by anyone; barring a very unlikely occurance in which the Earth is destroyed all at once, except for a few people who witness the event, the extinction of Mankind will never be consciously known by anyone.  It\'s hard to describe now, a week afterward, but at the time it was horrifying beyond description.    My friend helped to calm me down, but I was still feeling disturbed as we left the theater.  I was not in the mood to return home yet, but we had no more cash for more entertainment, so we parked in the lot of a Wal-Mart, which is still busy in the middle of the night, so that we could sit for another hour without being noticed or pulled over and arrested. While we sat listening to Sphongle and watching rain slide down the windshield, I began to have open-eye visual distortions; everything took on the appearance of watery distortion, like the rain sliding down the glass, and the outside world was a kaliedescopic array of bright colores and lights split through the prisms of water droplets.  The world was a bright stereoscopic vision, and only I saw it thus; I was transfixed by this new idea, that I among all the world was the only person having this experience at this moment, and that this made me... what?    It was this moment which classified this trip as a level IV entheogenic experience: I was struck by the realization that I was alone in a universe of my own imagination--a dreamworld, created by the dreamer, in which I would relive every moment of every human life, in endless configurations and emotional states and with every range of experience.  In short I was God, the universal awareness, expressed through every human being as a different individual, because the prismatic effects of spacetime split the Godhead into a legion of individual observers, each capable of assuming an individual identity.  This was not a moment of solipism, in which I discovered that I was God Almighty, Master of the Universe, but rather that I am a humble cell in a cosmic entity, into which I will reassimilate when I die, and from which I will again split away, to live again, and again, and again, and again, and again....... ad infinitum.    I was stunned, and had enormous difficulty explaining this to S as she drove me back to my apartment; I have still not come to terms with it, as it was too powerful and affirmative to ignore, yet also to startling to easily accept.  I look forward to repeating the experience, with the hope that I may continue to explore the transcendental state which I attained."
53762,Twenty Seeds and The Good Book,Ritzbitts,"Nov 9, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'d tried morning glory and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds in the past, at the dosages recommended on the internet (five - twelve seeds), without much success. The first time I tried morning glory seed, I had something very slight happen but not worth mentioning. I tried eight Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and experienced a mild, distracted frame of mind that kept me up all night. I could feel there was more possible with these seeds, so one day I decided to ingest more.    My family life had been riding an insane roller coaster for the last few months, with all kinds of horrible surprises and random reconciliations. This day was a good day, things were calm and everything seemed ok. I had been trying to get some LSD, but without much immediate success. I was somewhat dejected about this, but not especially so.    For a moment the house was empty, I had it all to myself. I remembered my big baggy of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. I grabbed it and counted out twenty seeds. I remembered the last time, with eight seeds, tediously scraping off the coating for an hour only to have a horrible stomach ache despite my labors. So, instead of painstakingly scraping off the coating, I just peeled off the bark-like stuff on the outside and threw the seeds in a grinder. These things are rock hard, and after a few minutes of grinding I had a powder with some hard chunks of seed.    I took the powder and put it in a tall glass of water, then proceeded to drink it, swallowing the chunks like pills. In the future I plan on grinding the seeds more thoroughly, and putting them in a milkshake or some such beverage to mask the taste. There is a lingering queasiness to these seeds that pervades their taste, it really isnt pleasant. I downed the muck, and decided to go about things for awhile, until I was unable. Based on my past experience with the seeds, and hallucinogens in general, I didnt expect too much from them. About thirty minutes after ingesting the mess, the uneasiness in my stomach began to turn to nausea. Without hesitation, I grabbed my pipe and smoked a small bowl of Cannabis. Over the last few months, Id been drastically cutting back my cannabis consumption for various reasons, but I still know it makes stomach pain go right away. Sure enough, the one bowl eased my stomach.    I went from my bathroom to my room, and tried talking to some friends via the internet. I could tell something was off. I had a huge smile that wouldnt go away, but I didnt know why it was there to begin with, which of course I found hilarious. I tried putting on some music, but my computer refused to work! No sound would come out of the speakers. I was still with it enough to know how to remedy the problem, but nothing was working. Frustrated, I put my computer (a laptop) aside and decided to lie back and relax, and try to come up with some ideas on what to do.    There is a poster on the wall of my room thats been there since before it was my room. It is black with colorful letters on it that spell out various names of God from the Bible, with references and all. I began reading the poster, for the first time in a long time. I kept reading it over and over, maybe a hundred times, I cant be sure. My concentration was now shallow but intent. I began interpreting each name on the poster, understanding exactly what it meant. After awhile, I began tripping on the poster. Individual names would stretch and fill the whole poster, the poster itself would grow in size and undulate, etc. At the time I didnt realize just how active my vision was. Everything was doing something, mostly anything with writing of any kind (my clock, the poster, books on the shelves) would expand and grow larger, magnified so I could read it.    After an indeterminate amount of time (more than an hour and a half), I began to be overwhelmed by the poster. My thoughts were starting to fire off at the speed of light, and the visual trips intensified. I remembered that I had a Bible nearby, and immediately I grabbed it. I began to read. While reading and concentrating best I could on the reading, I started to come up more and more and more. I suddenly understood everything about the Bible, the stories, the meaning of God and evil. I am a philosophically inclined person, Im always reading about these things in various context, so thinking about these things was something I enjoyed very much.    As I was reading, visuals became more and more intense, my right arm became semi-transparent like a tropical fish, with patterns on it. My proprioception was all over the place, I felt as if I was actively controlling every bodily process, including breathing. The Bible I was reading became an enormous structure, somewhat like a monolith of cinematic fame, but not quite. My being was flying, floating in front of this gargantuan work as I was being infused with comprehension of all kinds. I wasnt sure if my eyes were open or shut, because my surroundings became like space, with just my growing understanding and the Bible still present.    I continued to climb for some time, to the point that I completely lost my body. I was moved to (or shown?) a realm of pure energy I had never seen before. My mind and soul were there, but my body was nowhere and I couldnt care less. I was doused with intermittent feelings of euphoria well beyond anything else Ive ever experienced and sorrow, though the trip was never what Id call bad. I was allowed to observe a divine aspect of everything, I was being clued in to a supreme metaphor, and I was being overloaded with concepts and revelations.    It became known to me gradually the real reality of what being human is. I saw that my body and mind were filters, filtering out this vast scope of information that was there the whole time. It was as if I was seeing dimensions beyond those Id ever been allowed to see, dimensions of tangible abstract, of being, of energy, and more. Yet they were always there, I just was spared the understanding of them. It defies description. I was in this place for some time.    After awhile, my mind began to tire. My brain was fatigued, overloaded with information not meant to be communicated by mortal means. I started to re-appear in my body. I was lying on my bed, completely soaked in sweat and who-knows-what, utterly drenched. My energy was drained, but my mind was still active and I couldnt stop it. I started staring at my curtains and tripping on them, but after a short while of looking at any one thing or area my eyes began violently shaking left to right, it was uncomfortable and tiring. I closed them for some time, and experienced more mind-tripping, but was far too exhausted to carry on with it.    Finally, I forced myself to open my eyes. I was in a contorted position, wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. The denim fibers were a sight to behold, they rippled and undulated, breathing all the while. The hairs on my arm would zoom in, as if in a bubble, and travel across my vision. This would happen with various things I concentrated on. At this point I noticed that my stomach was in pain, but I didnt care and was able to zone it out of my mind, allowing the visuals to wash over me and relax me.    Roughly six hours after I ingested the twenty seeds, I thought I was back. The visuals were fading and my stomach became much harder to ignore. I grabbed a brown paper bag to vomit in, but after spitting up some grossness for a few minutes I began to intensely trip on the inside walls of the paper bag. Once this started, my stomach again vanished from my being. I continued tripping visually for a few hours, then became very tired.    I turned out the lights and tried to sleep, but my mind was still racing and visual distortions abounded. Im not entirely sure if I slept that night, if I did, it wasnt a restful sleep. In the morning, I got up from my bed to shower. I was a mess and smelled it. I walked into my bathroom and beheld a bright reflection of sunlight off a section of white wall. From this, a kaleidoscope of yellow rushed at me and my head began to hurt intensely. I kept getting head rushes and losing my vision for brief periods throughout the day. In the shower I tripped again, it took far too much concentration to break away and do anything. Anything white or yellow that I saw touched by sunlight was electric, and parallel lines like those in tile grout undulated and breathed. My stomach was uneasy for quite some time.    It wasnt until the next day, after getting a full nights sleep and eating a good meal or two, that I felt back to normal. The visual distortions ceased and I could hold a train of thought again. Bodily processes felt normal again, that is, walking, sitting, eating, etc, and I knew I was back.    Eight seeds did next to nothing for me, but twenty gave me the most profound experience and intense trip of my entire life."
65221,Trip Through Memory Land,SoaV,"Nov 12, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Alcohol,"[Will be referring to Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds as HBs throughout]    Date of experience: 11 August 2007  Age: 22  Gender: female    Previous experience: alcohol, magic mushrooms, weed, speed, MDMA powder, ecstasy, herbal ecstasy, H.B. woodrose    Setting: in my messy but beloved studio flat, alone. Had not eaten for about six hours beforehand. Prior to taking the HBs, consumed one 70cl bottle of 5.1% vol. alcopop and three glasses of vodka mixed with an energy drink over a period of six hours.    Mood: somewhat sleep-deprived, a bit ill with a cold and generally feeling quite amused with but detached from reality.    Expectation: low. Suspecting that my last HB trip may have been due in part to a slight fever. Wanting to do something creative during my trip, if it does occur, to truly capture it and try to do it justice.    T=0:00  Its 2:45 in the morning and I have decided to take two HBs to examine how they mix with alcohol. Removed husks, chewed well and kept in my mouth for about 30 seconds, quite possibly less  I find the taste sickening.     T=0:05  Supposed placebo effect playing up: Im experiencing disorientation, a sense of impending nausea and mild dissociation. Having another drink, this time vodka coke. Feeling rushes of exhilarating, almost dizzying come-up effects. Im not too familiar with the effect of the seeds so I cant tell if the sensation is real or imagined. Also feeling slightly nauseous, as expected: a sickening sensation is creeping down into my arms, not unlike when Im about to faint. Wavering between going to the bathroom and staying in my chair waiting it out. Feeling very depersonalised, as though Im just a pair of eyes rather than a subjective individual. Switching from hard-trance to a somewhat softer type of trance (Underworld, to be specific) appears to alleviate the nausea somewhat.    T=0:30  Am feeling cold  in stark contrast to last time I took HBs when I felt very warm. Briefly amused by a TV program about great football goals  it was showing last time I took HBs and I loved it. I still find it funny but Im not getting any laughing kicks this time. I suspected HBs and alcohol would not mix well for me, and my instinct appears to have been correct. Its like my soul has been disconnected from my body. Im feeling the effect of the seeds coming on properly now: I keep closing my eyes to float off into my own strangely dark and shapeless but comforting world.     T=0:45  Taking another seed  probably ill-advised seeing as Im already feeling sick. The seed tastes bitter and foul and I swallow it almost immediately. Getting some water. The water tastes good but Im still feeling nauseous. Struggling to turn my thoughts inward. Im guessing this is caused by the alcohol as I had no such problems last time I took HBs. Short-term memory obviously affected: rolled two roaches for one cigarette without realising (note: I use roaches for cigarettes as well as joints, the latter of which I smoke very rarely  more due to lack of access than lack of want). Currently blowing smoke-rings and indulging in their beauty.    T=1:00  Went to throw up as my body seemed to be begging me to expel some substances. Was unable to vomit properly and the nauseous feeling in my arms remains, however at the same time Im enveloped in a sense of contentment and euphoria. Noticing a mild double vision effect in that the black-on-white letters on the computer screen appear shaded, and colours and sounds also appear very sharpened. Im regretting slightly having presumably dimmed the effect with alcohol.    T=1:15  Feel compelled to close my eyes and trip. No CEVs whatsoever but its still very pleasurable. My body feels content and cosy: Im sitting practically horizontally on my computer chair and my thigh is complaining, but I barely notice. My sister is playing scrabble online and when she presents to me a sequence of letters over instant messenger I find myself able to rearrange them very easily in my head. Memories are also extremely clear in my mind, right down to the smallest detail. I cant quite choose which ones to display but the ones Im touching upon are pleasant and very vivid. They relate more to the general scenario at the time than to a particular feeling but the clarity is such that they are captivating regardless.     T=1:25  Losing concept of time and am struggling to calculate how long its been since my first dose. Im feeling good: the sense of nausea remains but its not overpowering. Im not smoking much and I feel quite disgusted by the thought of having more alcohol.  Enjoying music a lot. It doesnt take on as much depth and significance as it does with MDMA, but it sounds beautiful. Im still feeling unpleasantly cold even though Im wearing a sweater. Donning a robe. Suddenly Im back in the town where I lived four years ago. The strength of the memory is distracting. Feeling pleasantly lethargic: relaxation quite unlike what Ive ever felt before. I keep getting distracted by mundane objects, not because theyre interesting but because my eyes just glue to them and dont let go.    T=1:45  Still struggling with calculating time-lines. Also still speaking to my sister, with which I have no problems whatsoever even though Im feeling distinctly off baseline. Im getting the pixellated mushroom effect: everything appears overlaid with a thin web of geometric patterns. Feeling giggly. Not quite able to control what mental images to view, so Im just enjoying them as they come. The visuals are almost exclusively memories and not the swirling-colours-and-breathing-walls ones I know from mushrooms. Overall Im having a very pleasant experience. I can feel no alcohol effects whatsoever at present.     T=2:00  Completely lost concept of time  I have to count on my fingers to calculate the time-line. My body feels incredibly heavy. Leant back in my chair for a minute, arms hanging limply by my sides, and felt like I could stay like that forever. Going to switch the lights off. Shit. Keep freezing physically. Not quite seizing up but something similar. Went to throw up and sat hugging the toilet bowl for a few minutes, experiencing the overlay web-effect especially strongly (as I always do in bathrooms  presumably due to the brightness of the tiles and porcelain). The nausea has magically vanished and now a smile is literally plastered to my face. I realise I should be worried as Im going to a party tomorrow at four (its now 4:55 a.m.) and I want to look and seem at least human, but somehow I just dont care. I have an amazing view of the impending sunrise from my room. The sky appears very two-dimensional but incredibly beautiful, however the realisation that I am too tired and distracted to make something creative out of this sunrise  like a painting or even a drawing  makes me feel melancholic. I change the music from Underworld to Infected Mushroom, infusing me with a sense of novelty and interest.    T=2:40  Feeling physically fine  good, even  but mentally I am slightly confused. I keep being assailed by memories: currently I am seeing the garden of the house where I grew up. I can see the neighbouring garden and nearby playground very clearly, and sharp as a photograph is the small patch of forest where I used to play and the collection of bushes where my beloved feline would lie watching over us all. I can definitely see the use of LSA as a therapeutic aid  with a bit of guidance, I imagine it could lead to some serious personal revelations, especially with regard to retracing old memories. Currently deeply contemplative.    Cigarette smoke looks absolutely beautiful. Contrasting the effect with mushrooms, I dont have such  a sense of the borderline supernatural: with mushrooms (specifically Mexicans  on Hawaiians I experienced little more than disturbingly invasive visuals and a feeling of sickening restlessness) I always had a deep sense of togetherness with the Universe in all its beauty. Im experiencing a similar sensation now but am somehow completely detached at the same time. In a lot of ways I would consider this trip stronger than mushrooms, but it feels more controlled and there isnt such a sense of all-encompassing awe  also, it was years ago that I last took mushrooms (tragically), and perhaps Im not doing them justice. Am continuously stroking my legs in an autoerotic fashion.    T=3:15  My gender means very little to me at the moment. Ive experienced that sensation on mushrooms before: I know I am straight, and female, but I seem to lose touch with my gender identity very easily, almost as if my soul is inherently sexless. I cant quite identify myself with my name either (experienced many times before on mushrooms) but I feel that I know myself on a level so deep as to be positively profound. Speaking of profound, I am unexpectedly burdened by a profound sense of loss. All the memories shooting though me  my beautiful childhood, my first love, my first experience with soft drugs, hard drugs, university, loss of friends, gaining of friends, loss of relationships  make me feel absolutely sick with loss and mysterious longing.   I am struggling under a cloud of memory overload. Almost exclusively neutral ones but its difficult to take them all in.     Having another glass of vodka coke at T=3:25. I could feel a vague heartburn sensation approaching as I was about to pour the alcohol and am guessing that it was psychosomatically induced. Noticing that my visual acuity is incredibly precise but my peripheral vision is all but nonexistent.    T=3:30  My left arm is feeling tingly and strange. Immediately fears of cardiac arrest enter my mind, but upon feeling my pulse I find that its steady. Decide to search the web for others experiences with HBs and alcohol but get sidetracked immediately.   I think Im coming down slightly. I feel sad that I havent drawn anything whilst tripping  I really wanted to but Ive not felt able to somehow. Just drew a picture of myself standing on a free-floating plateau watching Earth from a distance. The idea behind it feels supremely apt but my drawing style is very abstract and ugly. I am also much too meticulous about my precise vision to enjoy drawing. Having strong flashbacks to my last trip, where I felt like I was standing on the brink of another dimension. Every single word I read, every single thing I see appears to me like a sharp, tangible message from that Other Side. I am again experiencing the grotesque feeling of ultra-real familiarity that intrigued me so much during my first HB trip. It is not necessarily pleasant but I cant help but feel drawn to it.     T=3:30-4:00   My mirror image looks aesthetically beautiful, smooth and vague like a painting. I, however, feel like an apparition. I feel like a shadow. I feel like a ghost. I feel like I am not here. The notion of I has lost its meaning entirely. I am experiencing a mild case of ego-death  mild because Im sure it could be even more profound, even more all-consuming. I would rate my current high as a +3 but I should note that the strongest substances I have taken besides this one are MDMA, psilocybin and amphetamine. I want to try LSD some time: I used to think that it would be too strong for me but now I think I can handle it. In fact, I think I am mentally much stronger than I ever realised.    Some words  such as too, me, life, but, normal  affect me so deeply that its an actual, physical struggle to write them. A bit of net surfing reveals that my vision is extremely two-dimensional. Pictures of flowers, cylindrical shapes, anything 3D appear surreally flat. Only semantics allows me to comprehend what the pictures actually represent. Its no wonder that I am unable to draw at the moment: the inspiration is there but I have no sense of visual depth. Very painful headache, almost turning migraine-like with my left eye tearing up. No more alcohol for me.     T=4:15  Intense trailing effect. Everything is still overlaid by a shimmering web and the two-dimensionality is still as present as ever. I do have some control over it but not much. Still experiencing a distinct sense of ego-death. Ill be surprised if this high doesnt affect my personality in some very real way. My hands have strange black marks all over them, like soot. I have no clue where I got them from. Actually, wait, that was stupid: its obviously from when I was drawing.    Flashbacks of ships, sledging, gravel roads, forests, losing things, finding things. My whole life. I often think of the meaning of my existence, but never like this. I have the answer. Its right there in front of me and I cant question it: it just is, and I just am, and that thought is so frightening, so awful, so terrifying that I feel physically crushed by its weight. But I still find life beautiful. I can still enjoy it. It still has meaning to me. Drinking some water to combat extreme thirst. It tastes very good and looks beautiful. I feel very tearful.     T=4:45  Memories are still very, very clear but neutral, like photographs. Only by logic can I attribute feeling to them. That other dimension I keep sensing is the world I experience in my dreams. I know they are actual realities, I just dont know if they are real in the same way as my sober world is real.     T=5:00  Coming down, almost suddenly. Its now 7:45 a.m. and I feel very similar to how I felt 30 minutes into the trip. Im exhausted in a fairly pleasant way. The prospect of the party later today should worry me but I have a feeling that my sleep will be very restful and satisfying.     After-effects:    Its now been 48 hours since the initiation of my trip. I struggled to fall asleep and lay awake reading for about two hours after going to bed, finding the characters in the book very sympathetic and real. Once sleep came it was deep and restful: when I woke up at four the next afternoon I felt better than I normally would have after such a limited period of sleep, as well as slightly euphoric and gently amused by life in general. I did find it a little difficult to relate to people at the party I went to at first, but eventually I ended up drinking a lot of alcohol and having quite a good time  I did bawl miserably for 15 minutes or so when I came home, but that is not uncommon for me when drinking.    Now, two days after the trip, I feel completely back to baseline but some fuzziness is definitely present, and Im feeling a little emotionally tumble-dried. I have decided that fascinating as the effects of HBs are, I cannot continue to take them weekly  theyre just too strong and I could easily see myself overusing them as the effect is so interesting whilst not being as debilitating as that of mushrooms."
64618,Woodrose in the Woods,Podofsky,"Sep 24, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"BASIC DETAILS:  Podofsky, male, 1972, 11 st.  Cinzano, male, 1973, 14 st.  Rodriguez, male, 1973 14 st.    PREVIOUS SUBSTANCE EXPERIENCE:  Cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine, mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, betel nut, salvia    CONTEXT:  Camping in woodland. Six people altogether, all of whom know each other well. We went for the night in some woods near Ladybower Reservoir in Derbyshire: Mr Big, Cinzano, Podofsky and the three Rodriguez brothers. This is something we have done for a few years now, and some of us have previously had pleasant tripping experiences in this beautiful spot. It was the first camp of the year, just after Easter, so the trees had only just started budding and it wasnt very warm.    SUBSTANCES TAKEN:  Hawaiian baby woodrose (agreiya nervosa) seeds, cannabis, betel nut and alcohol.    PREPARATION:  Thoroughly scraped seeds  first removed any thick hairy bits (easy), and then thin white coating beneath that (tricky). Soaked in lemon juice for 5 minutes (on advice that acidic solutions might help reduce the nausea).    DOSE:  3 seeds per person. Oral ingestion  chewed and swallowed.      DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIENCE:  What follows are two descriptions of the experience  one by Podofsky and one by Cinzano  because we thought it might be useful to document different individual accounts. Rodriguez says that his experience was pretty similar to Podofskys, so he hasnt written one.    PODOFSKY  After a brisk walk to the top of the hill and back in the late afternoon, we started the fire and then cooked and ate our food  loads of it: Corn-on-the-cob, trout, beefburgers, chicken, and doughnuts. During this time, we were drinking beer and smoking some fine weed. The three of us that intended to do HBW had read other peoples experiences of it, and the thought of the nausea that usually accompanies the experience led us to delay eating the seeds until after wed eaten. In hindsight, Id say that this was a poor decision only because of the timescale of the experience, and that the seeds probably wouldnt have affected our appetite as we feared they might.    So it was about ten oclock at night when Podofsky, Cinzano and Rodriguez ate three seeds each. We decided on this amount based on previous experience and advice from an experienced user. We were aiming for a good time, without \x91losing it too much. The seeds had been scraped thoroughly, and then soaked in lemon juice for a few minutes. This was following advice from a chemist friend who suggested using vinegar to help remove the nasty chemicals that make you feel sick (and all we had that was acidic was lemons to go with the fish  mmmmm, rainbow trout with lemon and dill).     There were no noticeable effects within the first hour. Cinzano suggested taking more seeds because nothing much had happened, but we decided against it. I guess that the amount of food we had eaten delayed our experience. In the next hour, we all began to experience something more besides the content feeling induced by a fat joint, a full stomach and a wood fire  an inner warmth or tingly feeling, followed by an increasing appreciation of the visual surroundings. It was a windy night, but we were on the leeward side of the hill so it wasnt too blowy and cold where we were. Thin clouds were racing by the full moon that we could see through the silhouettes of trees. Because there werent many leaves on the trees, the moonlight illuminated the whole hillside.     By midnight (two hours in), we were all feeling pretty good, and having a right laugh. The eldest of the Rodriguez brothers  who had only been drinking and smoking  was telling loads of stories involving shit and sick, which, although they were very funny, made the three of us who had taken HBW feel very queasy. None of us were sick, and although we all felt slightly nauseous, it was tolerable. Normally, we would have gone to bed by now, but there was something a little different this time, and we stayed up for another two hours.    In that time, we reported definite visual effects: I saw a pink and green wobbly halo around a moon that had become more intensely bright. Normally when tripping, Id have my head craned upwards most of the time, admiring the patterns of the trees and sky, but I was happy just to poke the fire a bit and feel content. But I was really impressed by the way the combination of HBW and moonlight lit up everything, and Rodriguez and Cinzano said they were too. It seemed to make me piss a lot, but apart from that there were no noticeable physiological effects. It was too dark to see, but I would guess we had dilated pupils. By 2 a.m., we decided to turn in after what was a great day, and we were happy with the effect of those three little seeds. It was when we were tucked up in bed that things really got going.    As soon as I had settled into my sleeping bag, I felt unusually comfortable and at rest. Then waves of euphoria washed over me, and I could barely stop myself from bursting out in laughter. Although the evening had been very enjoyable up to this point, I was quite surprised at the effects of the HBW at this late stage. I realised that I was definitely tripping, and I wore a Cheshire-cat grin as I lay there. It became apparent that I probably wasnt going to get much sleep  again I felt like I needed to pee, my mind was active and I saw lots of closed-eye visuals.     I was desperate to know if the others were feeling the same as me, and I wanted to share this lovely experience and talk about it. I asked Cinzano how he felt, and he was having a bad time. I felt upset because I was responsible for bringing the HBW, and felt guilty of having a good time when he wasnt. Luckily, after five minutes, though he says it felt like an hour, Cinzano said he was good again. I wanted to get up again and sit round the fire again with the others and talk about it all, but instead I just lay there, enjoying the warm euphoria and trippy visuals. I eventually drifted off to sleep after the sun had risen again.     Even though I only had about an hour of sleep, I felt really refreshed in the morning. Looking back, Id take the seeds much earlier in the day so it wouldnt last into the night, but the delayed effects were probably also due to the amount of food we had eaten. The nausea was unpleasant but tolerable. Being outdoors is highly recommended for this type of activity.      CINZANO  Ill pick up my experience from just after the barbecue.  Around this time I was feeling nicely baked from a couple of cans of beer and several joints shared through the afternoon. By way of background to our camp, the group of us had been camping in the same spot together for about 10 years.  Normally we would have our barbecue then relax and settle into the evening around the fire, talking intermittently in a stoned stupour, each quietly content in our own world, and normally we would retire to our tents around midnight.    10pm: We ingested the HBWR. I had read many experiences and embarked on the trip with trepidation and excitement knowing that we could arrive at either heaven or hell.  I was also interested to see how the evening was going to pan out in terms of interaction between the group of six given that on three of us took the seeds.     10-11pm: After an hour the only effect seemed to be a slight feeling of euphoria.  The mood at camp was good, light-hearted banter and laughs all around.    11-12am: After two hours the euphoric feeling had increased and was combined with a sensation in my stomach which was a strange blend of excitement and nausea, almost like the knotted gut of a first date.  The nausea wasnt overpowering and didnt bother me too much.      12-1am:  There was a noticeable shift of the gears during this period.  What also happened was that the mood of the whole group lifted and everyone told stories and were laughing and joking.  There seemed to be a really positive vibe amongst the group that to my mind was bought about due to the HBWR, and the positive feelings emanating from the three takers.   The euphoria continued and a general contented, happy and loving feeling was running through my entire body.  At this point I felt that the seeds had given me the rush of MDMA and I was happy with that.  Thankfully the nausea stopped.    1-2am:  Again another phase and the HBWR really kicked in, the previous feeling continued, but new sensations and visuals kicked in.  Sat in my chair I began to feel at one with the natural surroundings. The moon was full and shone like a beacon over the night sky, the clouds that passed over its welcoming face framed the image like a shot from a werewolf movie.  The moon in my mind throbbed like a goddess calling me upwards.  I really connected with the moon, sky and the bare branches above me.  The tree branches outlined against the sky held within them a deeper meaning and began to \x91fractalise into complex galaxies, which was a beautiful sight.    I really enjoyed this part and for me was where I peaked.  I looked around me and Rodriguez and Podofsky were also looking to the skies in semi-entranced states.  An overwhelming sense of love for my friends, my wife and nature swept over me and was sustained for this period of time and was fantastic. Shortly afterwards I realised that I was tripping, which was followed by a slight feeling of paranoia, I felt like I was starting to see tension within the group and I couldnt shake it.    2am-?: At 2am we went to our beds and I wanted to sleep but quickly realised that that wasnt going to be possible.  Paranoia kicked in, I felt that my friends at work werent friends and were using me, I felt that my card had been marked at work for things said in meetings, and I thought that my marriage was a sham.  A feeling of uncontrollable dread swept over me and I began to panic.  I wanted the trip to end and I knew from past experiences that it wasnt that simple.  My breathing quickened and I tried to calm myself.  This episode was like a trip inasmuch as my ego was being broken down and all I held dear was falling away.  Concurrent to all of these thoughts I was having vivid inward patterns and images chielfly in the form of vibrantly coloured fractals and eastern Gods like Ganesh and Vishnu.    I drew on past experiences and told myself that this was a normal feeling to have during a trip and in my minds eye I visualised a glowing cross.  Im not sure why a cross, as Im not a Christian (maybe this came to mind as it was Easter?) in any shape or form but this was the image that saw me through the paranoia as it symbolised me and all that I loved.  It told me that I was happy with who I was and I calmed myself through self- assuredness.  It was a locked glowing box full of love that prevented total paranoid breakdown. The panic stopped, insecurities did come back to my mind but passed and eventually I drifted to sleep.    I awoke, feeling slightly shaken.  I did not expect to have a full blown trip, and the paranoia was most unwelcome, this seeped a little into the next day but when I got home and spoke through the experience with my wife and had a hug I knew I was ok.  After a few days all the negative feelings had abated and the longer that time has passed the more I think that the whole experience was wholly positive.  It definitely had similar effects to trips and MDMA in that it takes the best (and worst!) elements of both.  On reflection we should have taken the seeds much earlier in the evening, we could have then had a better nights sleep.  Id read of other peoples experiences that HBWR can have a very positive effect on group dynamics despite the fact that not everyone has taken the seeds, I would fully endorse this. Overall though a great experience, I was after a mild lift for the evening and got much more, although I wouldnt have wanted any stronger a dose."
63938,The Full Spectrum,Realwolf,"Jun 25, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"My first real trip took place during the autumn of my final year of college.  The entire trip took place within the confines of the campus grounds.  I had been a habitual pot smoker for about two years at this point, but hadn\'t really experimented with any psychedelics.  However, after meeting my friend Q who was heavily into psychedelic drugs, as well as finding myself listening to more and more psychedelic music, I felt I was ready to begin experimenting with something other than pot.  Thus, myself, Q, and my friend Z all agreed to eat some baby woodrose seeds one rainy Saturday afternoon.  Despite the gloomy weather, we were all in a very good mood.  I had not researched nor read very much about psychedelics before this trip, and wasn\'t entirely sure what to expect (especially since these seeds weren\'t as commonplace as magic mushrooms or LSD).    Q, Z, and I each consumed three baby woodrose seeds at 2:00 PM, without preparing them in any fashion.  I should note that I did not swallow them whole, but rather chewed them and held them in my mouth for about fifteen-thirty seconds each seed.  Again, we did not wash them or prepare them in any way, but ate them straight out of the bag.  We hung out in Q\'s room and listened to the entirety of the album \'Forever Changes\' by the band Love.  By the end of the album, I was beginning to feel a slight alteration in my general perception, but nothing significant.  At this point, I was wondering whether we were actually going to trip.    We spent the next hour or so simply talking, listening to music, watching the fractal visualizer on Q\'s computer, and more or less feeling pretty good about things.  About two hours after eating the seeds, I began to experience some nausea.  Q had warned me about this possibility, and while it was noticeable, it wasn\'t overpowering in any way.  Since the three of us were all feeling a bit nauseous, we all agreed that perhaps going outside and taking a walk might be a good idea.  The minute we went outside I felt a shift in perception.  The air was refreshingly crisp, and appeared as if it had been ionized.  The time was about 5:00, so the sky was darkening.  It had been raining for most of the afternoon, but was no longer.  I felt intensely interconnected with nature, unlike I had ever before.  I had no interest in modern technology whatsoever, and desperately craved to be deep into the woods and close to nature.      Fortunately, our college grounds had a huge forest, so the three of us trekked into the glen and descended down a hill.  The descent felt very symbolic in a way, representing our own descent into the depths of the human mind.  The ground was damp and muddy, and the air was cold.  The woods were foggy and made the experience more mystical.  The sounds of the forest were much more intense than usual, both my visual and aural perception had greatly increased, and my mind suddenly became very curious and powerful.  The effect was becoming more and more physically powerful during this time, my chest and particularly my legs had become numb.  Although the numbness was not unpleasant, I was still feeling a bit nauseous.      After about an hour in the glen, we decided it might be a good idea to eat some food.  After ordering some chicken fingers with french fries, I realized that I had little appetite and the nausea had increased.  The bizarre color combination of the cafeteria walls and the general decor seemed tacky, and it was very unpleasing to my senses.  I preferred the browns and dark greens of the earth. I took a bite of a chicken finger and it lacked taste. I could taste the processing and chemicals in it, and could not taste salt on either the chicken nor the french fries. I ate one chicken finger and maybe a dozen fries before we all decided that processed food was not working for us.  Z became very nauseous at this point, and wanted badly to go back.  I too was feeling increasingly nauseous. Now a little after 6:00 PM, we went back to Q\'s room.  At this point it had been nearly four hours since having eaten the seeds, and we were clearly reaching the plateau of the trip.     As we exited the cafeteria, I immediately felt the need to vomit the food I had just eaten, even though it was a small amount.  I tried to puke in some trees off the path on the way home, but I simply couldn\'t.  I decided it would be best to at least go back to Q\'s room before vomiting, which at this point felt inevitable.  The increases in aural and visual perception, which were very noticeable at this point, but were being completely overtaken by the extreme nausea.  Back in Q\'s room, I was sitting leaned up against a door resting on a pillow (any other \'normal\' position seemed unthinkable).  My vision was swirling, I could not stand up, and I feared lying down would increase the nausea.  Closing my eyes also worsened the nausea.  After about ten minutes in this unusual position, I vomited.  As a means of trying to take my mind off of the nausea, I started to read aloud \'The Aleph\' by Jorge Luis Borges to Q and Z, which helped distract me from feeling miserable.  Nevertheless, I was still becoming more nauseous and now truly petrified.  I vomited a second time, virtually all of the food I had eaten that day.      In Q\'s room there was the famous Japanese poster of waves and a whirlpool by Hiroshige. Staring at the poster, I could see the waves moving as if they were real.  Everytime I stared at the poster, I became more and more nauseous, so I avoided looking at it.  I tried to read Borges again, but was unable to do so, so we basically just hung out, trying to get a grasp of our experience. After about thirty minutes, I suggested we go outside again onto the big soccer field near Q\'s dormitory.  It was at this point that my world was spinning, my nausea had increased yet again and had become very intense. At the same time, my perception had increased greatly and my entire body was very numb.  Because I was so sick, I wanted the feeling to stop as soon as possible and simply desired to be in a normal state of mind.  I could barely stand up straight, my legs felt like jelly and I was stumbling around in a bizarre attempt to counter the nausea.      I went with Q, Z, and our friend X to the field.  It was dark now, but there was a sort of orange glow over the trees at the other end of the field.  The horizon line between the trees and sky did not exist, the two seemed completely connected and inseparable.  I was not experiencing any substantial visual hallucinations, although there were some minor auditory hallucinations.  Despite the silence of our environment, the field sounded very loud, almost as if nature was attempting to directly communicate with me.  The voices of the others were becoming irritating and only increasing my nausea, I tried to focus on the sounds of the grass, the field and the nearby forest in trying to help me forget about the nausea.  I walked about 50 yards away from the others and squatted on the ground.  I divided my focus between the grass and the overwhelming darkness.  I could hear the grass \'speaking\' to me, the water droplets on their tips were making a crisping sort of noise that was very loud.  I enjoyed it, and tried to continuing to focus on it, but at this point completely lost control.    Being alone, the effects of the LSA were increasing so rapidly that I became frightened.  My nausea was not going away, and I realized that I was in for a very bad trip.  A huge wave of paranoia set over me, and my heart was beating so rapidly I had to control every breath consciously. I felt as if I had made a huge mistake, and that not only the day but recent years of my life had been one giant mistake.  I felt as if I would never come down from the drug, it was utterly paralyzing. I felt the pressures that typically lie dormant in my subconscious overwhelming me, and at this point, I irrationally believed that I would either die (or worse) be stuck in this state forever.  I decided that I needed to be in a safer environment where I could focus on simply making it through the experience.      I decided to part from the others and headed back to my own room, which was comfortable and familiar.  I discovered that I could still perform basic tasks, like taking my shoes off, putting on music on my computer, and opening the door to my room with my key.  I set up my garbage can next to my bed where I anticipated much more vomiting.  I left the lights on as to avoid closed-eye visuals, which were simply unwelcome to my current state.  I climbed into bed, and found that my heart was beating even more rapidly.  This was the peak of my trip, and I was terrified. There were small rectangular reflections on my blinds that were moving around and making me feel sicker. The checkered patten of my navy and white comforter was also swirling and shifting, so I tried to stare at my grey carpeted floor.  I was also vomiting profusely.    I put some music on, very soothing spiritual music by a band called Brightblack Morning Light.  I knew that with every song, I was that much closer to coming down and re-entering the safety of \'reality\' where I could control my physical sickness.  I was now dry heaving, and I decided to drink water so I would have something to throw up.  Because I was dry heaving, I began to panic as if I\'d done something truly terrible to my body.  I went online to find similar LSA experiences to what I was experiencing, but I wasn\'t really able to comprehend them.  I irrationally feared that I had somehow eaten too many seeds, that we hadn\'t researched properly, and that something was truly \'not right.\'     As I continued to dry heave I contemplated calling my friend D, but since she had now drug experience whatsoever, I decided against it.  However, I was desperate for a babysitter, and although I did not want to interrupt my friends\' trip, I ended up calling Z to ask him specifically how much we had taken and tell him of the horrors I was experiencing.  He and Q took this as a cry for help and came over.  The entire time I had been in my room alone was only forty-five minutes, but felt like an eternity, and are more vivid in my memory than some entire months of my life.    Q and Z tried very hard to help me mentally conquer what I was going through, though every time my mind would drift back to the dark side, I would begin vomiting again.  They came up with the idea of watching something entertaining to take my mind off of it.  We began watching episodes of of the show Curb Your Enthusiasm which did in fact help take my mind off of it.  I continued to drink water and was still vomiting it up, but I was laughing and understanding the episode, which made me feel that I wasn\'t completely insane, just very physically ill.  Q and Z continued to help me work through it while watching the show, and the vomiting decreased.     After about an hour of watching, it was around 8:00 PM, and I was feeling much, much better and beginning to come down.  I was finally able to sit up after having vomited everything in my system and what felt like a gallon of water.  I was slowly sipping water, and at long last, not puking it up.  Q and Z ordered chinese food, and I agreed to get some food for later for when I was feeling better later or the next day. I was able to emerge from bed and go into my dormitory\'s common living space, where a number of my friends had come to hang out.  Their presence cheered me up, and it was nice to be in an safe environment with my friends.      I very quickly was starting to perk up and turn things around.  I was still very much feeling the effects of the LSA, although not nearly as intense as before. I was feeling so much better than I was even able to eat some food without vomiting.  The chicken itself did not have the flavor I desired, however, the simplicity of the white rice melded perfectly with what I wanted to taste and what I felt comfortable digesting.  The rice was excellent for me due to its ability to retain in my stomach, and I was also able to eat chicken and brocolli comfortably.     Our other friends were preparing to get drunk in our common space, and I understandably had no interest in doing so at the time.  We hung out in the common room and the trippers among us engaged in some philosophical musings, and eventually the others came back having bought a lot of alcohol.  They were being loud and rowdy, which was incongruous to my state of mind.  Their voices and actions were irritating me greatly, and I needed to be removed from them. I had now returned to an excellent mindset, so Q and I went to Z\'s room and listened to Terry Riley\'s \'Rainbow in Curved Air\' set to a visualizer.  My mood had greatly increased, in fact, I rarely remember feeling more cleansed, more at peace, and generally good-natured then than at any point in my recent life.    Q and I went back to my room with X and his girlfriend.  We put on some folk music, and I read Chuck Klosterman aloud to them, which had us all howling hysterically. This lasted us for a few hours.  At around 1 AM we went outside to smoke some marijuana, which positively brought back the trip.  All negative feelings had completely vanished, and we spent some more time in our common room chatting before we all went to sleep.  I went to sleep around 2 AM, and was still feeling the effects of the LSA.  As I was drifting off to sleep I was having some interesting visuals.  A beam of light was coming out of the green glow of my alarm clock.  I could alter the thickness and length of the beam, and had some fun playing with it.  Then, I let my eyes go unfocused, creating doubles of the green glow but also of the other digital glowing light in my room, such as the blue power circle from the speakers and the red glow from the mouse. The different colored glows were dancing around, shifting back and forth.     Eventually, I fell asleep, and presumably had some interesting dreams, though I cannot recall them.  I woke up the next day feeling an warm afterglow.  I felt very peaceful and contemplative, and still very close to nature.  I was unable to do productive things (like homework) and remained in a reflective state.  Overall, the experience was simultaneously one of the most enlightening and harrowing of my life, and I suspect that I will not forget it anytime soon.     I should also note that since the experience, I have continued experimenting with psychedelics (mushrooms, morning glories, salvia, yopo, amanita), mostly, in small doses, and have not had a single trip nor experience resembling this one.  I can definitively state that psychedelics have only positively enhanced my life, and they have done so in a number of ways.  I have, however, stayed away from the baby woodrose seeds, and would recommend that others who are thinking of trying these should know what they\'re getting into, as well as recommend doing the proper preparation/research necessary.  And of course, for anyone taking their first psychedelic trip, do your research and be absolutely sure to start with a small dose, because there is no way to prepare you for what you\'re about to experience."
22370,Community in a Seed,Kassiel,"Mar 9, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Hawaian Baby Wood Rose afforded one of the more compelling experiences I, and those with whom I indulged in this brain food, ever had.    The dosage we took was based in part by information found on the internet, in part by instinct. We broke 24 seeds into dust with a hammer, then simply ate the seeds with water. The taste was not awful, but I certainly see why people don\'t use Rose for garnish.    The experience was, for lack of a better word, immensely communal. The set was a group of four people, but expanded eventually to six with three viewers. We were all comfortable with one another before the experience, but I certainly feel the experience enhanced the social bonds between the Group. Three dosed, initially, and one remained Seedless. The setting was inside a house where we feel comfortable and at one point we took a walk outside, but this did not last long.    Communication between people was, at times, difficult, as it was often difficult to find the proper words to express the sensations discovered. However, in other moments we seemed to be thinking with a single group mind. Thoughts flowed like water between cups, for lack of anything less prosaic. There was no differentiation between the self and the other. Facial features took on an incredibly important meaning, as did body language, tone, and gesture. The individual words dissolved and became less important.     The chemical enhanced the pleasure received from music, and one musician in our group reacted very favorably and felt the Seed enhanced his ability to play his instrument. A major joy for me was to watch the group dynamics unfold, to watch the way the wind changed slowly when we sat outdoors, and to simply sit and be.    These experiences are inevitably innefable. That is, they will not be described, refuse to be described in any accurate wording. If you can describe the experience scientifically, it is likely, I believe, that the description will always and inevitably fall short of the event.    The experience lasted many hours -- full on, no longer than 8; peaked at about 3 or 4 hours; made it difficult to sleep; mind was very alive. It even lingered into the next day. It was a gentle, commmunal experience, with a great sense of unity between those in -- and even, if I have judged correctly -- without of the Seed\'s Grip. This, to me, was one of the best qualities of the experience. Some chemicals tend to isolate those within the experience from those outside the experience. Wood Rose seems to create a larger sphere of influence, so even those who have not enjoyed the Seed directly still receive some of its Shamanic -- brainfoodmindexpanding -- qualities.    As I understand it, the active chemical in HBWR is similar to the active chemical in Lysergic Acid. This would not surprise me, as the hallucinogenic quality of HBWR, when ingested, was enormous, to say the least. Momentarily, we were convinced that we had \'rediscovered\' the catalyst for the expansive, highly charged, unitive experience of the previous generation. A link opened between ourselves -- already united by the common experience -- and a larger world, and the inevitable call -- it is, I believe, quite a timely one -- became \'peace\' and \'love.\' The words are old, but they\'re valuable nevertheless.    Language became pressing. Words immediately flowed from intention and became action, expressed what they needed to. Strange words, words forced upon us, into our vocabulary, by the outside, became either malevolent or benevolent, depending on the assisting vibrations of past experience, love and hate, fear and trust.    The group, through the experience, swung between extremes of benevolent loathing to communal and of course Platonic love. The social atmosphere was intoxicating, even while inside the experience. It is perhaps unfortunate that we, or at least I, am not able, or have not in the past been able, to approach life and those around me with the joy and wonder that this Seed helped engender in me last night. However, I believe that the Seed itself is not the whole reason for this communal experience. There is, rather, a larger element to take into consideration.    A warning to anybody interested: the first hour or so, myself and another in our group reacted to the chemical by throwing up. This, of course, is not uncommon in the use of such things, but it need be warned. Before I use Rose Seeds again I intend to eat less meat during the day. I\'d had some pork and some chicken the day of the experience, and I believe my body reacted to the mix.  I would also drink only water, no coffee or alcohol, before ingesting.    The experience did not provide full on hallucinations. The world outside remained, physically, mostly as is. However, visions could be transposed onto the outside world, and the visions had with eyes closed were enormous and reveletory.    I am surprised that the lid has been kept on Wood Rose for as long as it has. I feel that these little seeds might be the best kept secret since Free Will.    kassiel"
36476,The Way Forward,SandskyCainer,"Feb 9, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"My drug career began in the usual way, smoking dope and skunk, for a good few years then trying pills (ecstasy) speed (amphetamine) and coke.    I loved pills, at first, as do all who give it a good go. I would always combine heavy cannabis smoking with whatever other substance I was doing. Cannabis has been the core to my exploration. The psychoactive effects always being a component in my experiences.    Even pills made me very trippy, when others would feel nothing. I would do 4-5 on a Friday night every fortnight or so, for about 6 - 12 months. But the comedowns started to become worse and any pleasurable effect diminished with time. Excitement wore off and I really started to question pills and look for something better.    I tried coke - and never looked back on pills. The relative lack of comedown in comparison to ecstasy meant I never returned. Again after 6 months to a year of that I reached a point where the negatives were starting to outweigh the positives. I had a particularly bad \'cocaine crash\' one time and felt so awful, that even though I still had half a gramme, I knew it wouldn\'t make me feel any better and I washed it down the sink. Most people who\'ve tried coke would admit its one of the hardest things to wash down the sink. It indicates how unhappy I was with it all.     So I stopped. Strong skunk being my only regular vice now. This is my psychadelic background. My experiences were always more mental than physical, it was always the consciousness altering experiences I was interested in.    I tried Mexican mushrooms, as always with heavy smoking and was amazed at what a difference there was to putting some heavily manufactured toxic substance in your body. I had all the effects described elsewhere, happy, trippy, giggly and best of all a feeling of general well being the next day instead of a comedown and a physically wracked body. The experiences were always predictable, being no more than 6 hours. The only negative for me was that I did feel nauseous at first, although I was never actually sick.    Sold by the benefits of natural substances, the legality aspects, the possible health risks of street drugs, I stumbled across HBWS.    I read everyone\'s experiences and paid particular attention to the method of oral ingestion through the tongue and cheeks. Everyone seemed to have had powerful experiences, no one said it didnt work for them. The oral ingestion method seemed to defeat the only negative, that HBWS would make you sick if you ate enough.    50 arrived next day from the internet at an average cost of 30 pence each (about 50c US) Prepared 3 seeds. Scraped very hard, to remove the poisonous furry husk, then burned them with a lighter to make absolutely sure. Ground them with a mortar and pestel into as small a powder as I could. I then put the powder in the bottom of a small glass with a tiny drop of water. This is supposed to help the LSA come out. I left for 5 minutes, then using a spoon, put the wet paste in my mouth. Keeping it there for 20-25 mins.    It was difficult not to swallow and trying to avoid salivating was the best way. Not talking seemed a good idea. After 20 - 25 minutes with minimal swallowing, I spat the paste out and cleaned my teeth. My cheeks had started to feel numb during the time it was absorbing in my mouth, but I didn\'t notice any other immediate effects.     Having tried it a few times since, I now realise that in the first hour after ingestion I feel warm, relaxed and almost sleepy. Everyone I have tried this with has a quiet first hour. A few have made the mistake of going to bed thinking they were tired and not in the mood and then lain awake for the next 7 hours feeling the full effects.    Everything was very gradual. I believe now that smoking cannabis aids the experience. It seems to act as a catalyst - a huge accelerant. I felt tiny tingles at first a bit like the first 30 minutes after taking ecstasy. There was just a gentle but relentless wave of LSA washing over me.    It appeared and just got ever stronger, but not in a way which was worrying. It was all so progressive and gradual. Small visuals started to appear, and although I could not see more I had a feeling that more were there behind a veil. I saw a big silver ball above the head of one of my friends that did not move. I moved and looked at it from different angles but it remained.     I was feeling pretty normal though. More than stoned, tingly a little euphoric, chatty, certainly not out of it. Just seeing this ball of silver light. I sat on the couch, chatted, smoked, watched tv and gradually became wrecked. The colours on the tv started to get vivid. Watching MTV with the sound off, our own hard dance music playing. We watched a bit of Tv for a while, some random show. Whilst that was on I felt quite normal and had minimal effects, but as soon as the tv was muted and the dance music was back on I felt instantly hammered again.    The effects kept coming. Lots of giggling, incomprehension, tripping, little vivid daydreams that would totally capture your attention only for a second, but in which time would seem to move much more slowly. Id come out of it to find only a second had passed and no one noticed my micro trip.    There was no nausea at all and in fact I was able to eat normally, which again was such a relief as I had always had eating problems with coke/ecstasy/amphetamines. After about 4 hours I was feeling very euphoric, tripping from moment to moment and generally having a very positive experience.    We decided to see if you could top up the effects, so each had another 2. This time I could definitely feel my mouth going numb as you kept the paste in your mouth. This seemed to work quite well for us. The effects still progressive but getting stronger as more and more started to work.    Things just became messy and hard to describe. In general we found you could describe the effects of taking a few HBWS as similar to ecstasy at first, then later it becomes more like a mushroom experience, then it moves into something else entirely.    People who were very experienced were lying on the carpet laughing, unable to move. The peak effects were still hitting us 7-8 hours after first starting.    I have tried it a few times since. I cannot fault the experience. I tried it once without smoking. I was watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, its practically the Law!!!!    It worked ok, there was an enormous amount of incomprehension. We watched another film afterwards and the effects seem to tail off after 3-4 hours. On my way home I called in at some friends who were still up. I had some skunk and it kicked everything off again and moved it to another level. Again there was strong environmental stimulation, music, lights, smoking. I felt wave after wave hit me. I was amazed as I thought the experience had passed and only on hour before I was totally normal.    That particular night I became the most wrecked I have been on any substance ever. With nothing but the cannabis acting on the LSA already in my system. I could barely move, I could feel my whole body buzzing with energy, I could hardly keep my eyes open, but when I closed them I would feel myself spinning off backwards into space as though my eyes were anchors to reality. I cannot really describe where I tripped to or what happened.    I totally recommend trying HBWS. It is a progressive substance. It combines very well with Cannabis. It has the potential to be what you want, a small number make it a natural substitute (from a mental perspective, not for physical effects) for ecstasy. More make it psychedelic. Adding skunk to the recipe is nothing like anything else I\'ve tried. I can remove the veil to other worlds, dimensions, realities.    Finally, HWBS are not morish, unlike cocaine or other substances. I got mine 9 months ago and still have half left. Its such a revealing experience and somehow I just dont feel like doing it at the moment. The time is not right. Its almost like it makes you respect it. So as a psychonaughts tool, I\'d rate it 10/10."
58763,"Room Spinning, Stomach Churning, Head Racing, Toilet Hugging Bad Drunk Feeling",girl,"Jan 14, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"My boyfriend and I decided to buy some of these at a retailer in England. We had gone in with the intention of buying shrooms, but we saw these and the clerk recommended them.     That evening, we each took six seed pods which we had scraped and soaked to the best of our ability. We still ended up having to do a lot of chewing.    After about an hour, we felt the first mellow, enjoyable effects of the trip. We felt very chill, and cracked up over certain objects in the room that suddenly looked hilarious to us.     Not long after, I began to feel a bit overheated and not-so-good, and my boyfriend was feeling the same.  We stood outside a while to get some air, but to no avail-- my boyfriend ended up retching in front of the building, and I ran into the bathroom to do the same.    We were both able to calm our bodies down a little, and sat on the couch. Things started to feel good again, we were feeling very frisky and decided to move the party upstairs.      After being \'intimate\' for a while, my boyfriend started to get paranoid...he was definitely moving to the next stage of his trip...he was acting worried and confused, couldn\'t talk much... I asked him if he wanted to go back downstairs to the couch and he said \'I need to work out where we are first!\' Trying to be the best trip-buddy I could be, I did my best to calm him and reassure him of where we were.  At this point I started getting tiny flashes of complete sobriety, and figured we were on our way back to normalcy.  This was nowhere near the case.    My trip began in full after a short while...it was not bad like my boyfriend\'s... however it was not good either.  Neither he or I had the desire to talk *at all*.  We each completely withdrew into ourselves, and verbalizing anything would have been very difficult.      I felt very calm throughout the trip, and found it difficult or too overwhelming to keep my eyes open, so I closed them for most of the time.  Even with closed eyes, I got rainbow-tinged racing-through-space visuals, including a revisit to the neighborhood we had walked through earlier in the day. Despite my calm, however, the trip felt physically uncomfortable to me, and I found myself hoping it would be over soon.      I felt nausea coming back... I could literally feel my stomach turn as it absorbed some of the substance, then feel a rush of the poison through my veins to my temples.  The headrush was very, very unpleasant.  The entire front of my skull felt intensely tingly.  Might sound cool, but wasn\'t.  Then the nausea became overwhelming enough that I went to the bathroom, made myself throw up, and repeated for the next six hours.     Eventually I got wise and smoked some pot, which calmed my stomach like a miracle.  I was able to go back to bed (though it was morning already).  My boyfriend\'s trip was over by that point-- he\'d spent the whole time terrified that something was wrong with me but was unable to get himself together enough to come check on me.    In the end, I can\'t \'blame\' HB Woodrose for my boyfriend\'s bad trip... bad trips happen with any psychedelic from time to time.  However, I would caution against using it because of the terrible physical symptoms it produced for me.  The only thing I could remotely compare it to might be the room-spinning-stomach-churning-head-racing-toilet-hugging bad drunk feeling.    Looking back, I should have 1)eaten only a little bland food before the trip, not a full meal or anything hard on the stomach, 2)started out by ingesting less than the suggested dosage of pods, and scraped and ground them better, and 3)smoked pot throughout the trip.  Ironically, it was my nausea that made smoking unappealing for me during my trip, but as soon as I actually took a hit, my nausea calmed down drastically.    In conclusion, this substance made me feel \'poisoned\' much more so than any other drug I\'ve ever taken, and this kept me from truly enjoying any of the visual aspects of the drug."
29053,Touch Sensitive,Justin,"Jan 5, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"On November 6, 2003 my friend told me that he had gotten some seeds that would make you trip just like lsd or shrooms.  Being the experimental type I decided to give it a try.  He was selling them to me at $0.50 a seed and I read on here that I needed around 6 to 10 in order to feel some effects. So I bought 6 seeds from him for $3.00. At 7:00 I swallowed a pill capsule that had 6 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds crushed up in it.  I then proceeded to smoke a couple of bowls with my friends(marijuana) and I sat down waiting for the effects to start.    I sat in the living room of a friends dorm until around 11:00.  All that I was feeling up to that point was a steady naucious feeling in my stomach.  I had decided that obviously the seeds were not going to do anything.  Since I had come to that conclusion there was no point in me sitting in the living room any more so I decided to go to a party that was going on that night.  The party was at a person\'s home and there were about 30 people there.    I went to the living room and sat down beside some people on a couch.  My stomach at that point was very uncomfortable to say the least so I decided to smoke another couple of bowls so at least I could be high.  I proceeded to do that and completely forgot that I had taken some hallucinagenic seeds earlier.  At around 1:00 I was sitting on the couch talking to a girl named Joy when I realized that I had started tripping.  We were talking about the world being on a pirate ship heading toward God readying to shoot God with cocaine...needless to say I was tripping my balls off at that point, so I started writing everything that I was thinking down on paper.    Me and Joy sat there for a few hours talking about everything while I was telling people not to forget the pirate ship.  I was surrounded by a bunch of drunk and stoned people so they didn\'t think a thing about it and agreed with me which enhanced my trip even further.  I talked to Joy until around 3:00 when everyone was going to sleep.  I was not about to go to sleep though, I was about to start a religion with my new thoughts about the world.  The room was dark so I couldn\'t see much, and my vision was blurred so I could hardly see anything else in the room.  Joy was snoring behind me and I wasn\'t about to go to sleep.    At that point I looked across the room and saw two piercing eyes staring at me across the room.  I picked up a small bottle of frank and murr and opened it and smelled it. The smell was so intoxicating at that point that I felt as if I was getting high off the smell of the scent.  My senses were extraordinarily sensitive and I felt a hand from nowhere touch mine.  The piercing eyes from across the room was now lying on the floor in front of me with her hand in mine.  I was amazed by the sexuality of her hand moving in mine and I proceeded to join her on the floor.    Every touch was amazing.  Her beauty and her sexuality was calling to me on a level that no one had ever touched.  She was an angel waiting for my approval.  I proceeded to touch her everywhere and she proceeded to lie on me and started kissing me.  My hands were not going to let me go to sleep.  They were caressing her with a fire that is not my own.  She said that she was not sure why she felt the way she did, but it was almost as if through me touching her that I spread my trip to her and she also had the energy that I had.  We kissed and caressed each other until dawn, not knowing when this heavenly experience would stop.    I was in a sort of drunken state in the morning, not because I had drank any alcohol.  I had blurred vision and complete relaxation of the muscles as I attempted to stand up.  I was like jello and I was tired.  It was 7:00.  My senses were in a state of exhaustion.  I could not feel anything at all.  It was as if I had used all my energy the night before and my senses were tired of everything.  All I had felt all night was sexual pleasure and my body could not do anything at all anymore.  I had not stopped talking though. I was talking all night long about her.  I was talking about everything that we did.    Anyway, it was morning and I was hungry.  The house was just right down the road from a fast food joint and I decided that I was going to walk down there.  I had no shoes on and only a t-shirt on and it was 26 degrees outside, but I could not feel anything.  I walked there and gave the lady at the counter a blank look and she said, \'well honey you gonna order anything?\' I was like...yeah, give me something for 2 dollars and a water.  So I got an egg mcmuffin and an ice water and walked back to the house.    By this time everyone was up and I could not taste the mcmuffin at all.  My senses were just blah.  I could not taste anything it was like eating nothing.  So I gave it to Molly the girl I had spent the night with and she ate it and went to sleep.  I got a ride back to campus and tried to lie down to sleep.  My mind was racing, I was overwhelmed by what had happened that night and my mind was trying to understand it.    I couldn\'t sleep so I went to get some food with some friends.  I was still sort of feeling crazy and was still talking.  I walked to another dorm to find someone that knew the girl that I had been with all that night.  I couldn\'t find him but bumped into a girl going to a band concert.  I went to the concert because I thought it might calm my mind and help me to get back to normal.  I was right, it calmed me down, but I was still tripping.    As I listened to the music, when the band would hit a particularly loud note I was feel thoughts come into my head.  As the string quartet played I imagined their music as a blanket around me.  The blanket was made of silk and it was the smoothest blanket ever.  I told this to the person I had come to the concert with and she just looked at me and smiled.    I finally stopped tripping by the end of the concert and I was feeling a little dumb, but I could stop the thoughts now.  By that night I was back to normal feeling better than ever.  I had not slept in 36 hours, but I was drinking caffeine to stay alive. This is the day after and there are no more after effects that I can tell.  I do not feel dumb like I do after eating lsd or shrooms, it is almost like I feel smarter.  My creativity is heightened and I feel it is easier to write and to draw.  I feel like a better person than I was before the trip.  This was the best experience with hallucinagens that I have ever had."
31978,Pivotal,Mr. Solinas,"Jan 5, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"This trip report isn\'t a usual one, describing the feelings and visuals of my induced euphoria.  Herein I\'ll describe the lifechanging profoundness, but I\'ll need your patience as the story requires a prologue so that the full implications may be realized.    Lately I have been extremely depressed.  Developing symptoms of severe depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, etc...  I\'m also dead poor, in a miserable school, miserable home, with miserable family, with no future.  There\'s lots of specifics to these, but you get the picture already.    A little while ago, my mental depression began to reach a height never thus reached.  I managed to keep my sanity, but day in and day out I knew I was depressed to the marrow.  Marrow, that brings me to the second point of that.  That my body, as the vessel of my mind and a parallel to it, has been suffering as well, and has fallen ill.  I\'ve been in a state of tragic misery, a slippery downward spiral from which there was no escape but suicide (which I\'d contemplated in detail far too frequently).  Bed ridden with mono, my mental state has been on a steep decline, my body has been exhausted.    But today I sucked it up and went out to the a Book Shop in downtown Vancouver, went inside to the little shop at the back called the Urban Shaman, and bought some HB Woodrose seeds (as well as some Cebil seeds & Calea Zacatechichi, both of which I have yet to try) with some chance money I recently came upon.  I got home, stuck 4 seeds in my mouth and waited a while.    Nothing happened.  So I waited a while longer.  And nothing happened.    So I chewed them up and held them in my mouth.  After a while I thought I felt some form of intoxication, but wasn\'t quite sure.  After another while, I swallowed the mildly bitter saliva and seed chunk concoction.    I started to get really tired, I mean dead tired.  I stumbled around the house in a stupor in an attempt to find my bed, where I literally crashed.    I started getting really sick.  I was getting unpleasurably disoriented and my nausea was worsening.  Thoughts were filling my mind of a parallel mental nausea from which I couldn\'t escape, not in a million years.  So I drank some water and closed my eyes.  I don\'t remember how, but I fell asleep.  I woke up about 10 minutes later, in the same condition.  These sleep disruptions persisted at irregular, yet brief, intervals reminiscent of the aforementioned.    Then I woke up.    About an hour or an hour and a half after I swallowed the seeds, I awoke to find my nausea gone.  I had this pleasant feeling throughout my body and my mind.  I put on Dark Side of the Moon, and began to write about the sun, the earth, and of my profound emotional relationship with them.    I\'m not really experiencing any visuals, but my imagination is wandering beautifully when my eyes are closed.  My mind is putting the pieces together of every jigsaw piece that plagues my mind and amounts to my general anxiety and depression.  I\'m learning so much about myself and my surroundings, to seemingly infinite extents in both intro- and extraverted directions.  I\'m filled with love for myself, my family (a few hours ago whom I\'d loathed the faintest of thoughts of), and the univers (that\'s just how I like to spell it).    These pivotal thoughts aren\'t just of general notion either.  My mind comprehends the emotional and mental specific aspects that reveal the inner and outer workings that ought to fall into place should the univers be a perfect place.    My appreciation for vibrant beautiful colours.  Not just actual visual colours, but the colours of life, of the mind, and of the heart.  I\'ve acquired patience, peace, and purity.    My illness is characterized by an extremely sore throat (it\'s a strenuous agony to try to swallow, yawn, or even turn my head), and a severely swollen neck, with complementary swollen lymph nodes.    But the swelling\'s gone down tremendously in the course of just a few hours.  As my body was a parallel of my unhealthy mind earlier, it is becoming a parallel of my happy/healthy (two words which I feel are the same idea) mind.    My creative and intellectual mind is being nourished, and that brings me an amazing joy.  My ego is disappearing.  I just feel great, through and through, all over.    Strangely, the one thing that kept me going through my suicidal depression was the hope that one day, I could achieve these feelings.  These feelings of peace and tranquility and happiness and health.  They seemed so unattainable, like they were designed for every human and animal on the planet save me.  These things were just concepts that dogged my mind day in and day out, because I couldn\'t have them.    But these seeds that contain LSA helped me achieve what I\'d sought for so long.  I feel enabled to take on the world.  I\'m no longer the sloth I was.  The high may be mild, but at the same time it\'s very intense.  That, and I know to make the most of what I\'m presented with (so does my body.  I believe it\'s possible to train your mind as well as your body to make the most of what mental, emotional, and physical \'nutrients\' you put in them.  This, I suspect, goes the same for drugs).  My life feels like it\'s turned on a dime.  No longer slipping away into the recesses of insanity.  I feel bright, radiant, vibrant, and warm.    -----    As you may have been able to tell, as I write this I am under the influence of the baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds.  So this feeling is only temporary, but even when the high is gone, I can still keep the insights I gained that shall serve me with the tools necessary to build a happy & healthy life.  And perhaps this mild trip is only the precursor & preparation to & for even greater experiences with higher doses & even other psychedelics.    Thank you drugs!  You\'ve healed me and changed my life.  Amen."
29616,The Void,Spacehound,"Dec 18, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"One week ago today a friend and I each consumed 6 Baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds. I feel that I should relate what happened to the two of us that day in order to help others interested in the substance and give to something back to erowid for being such an invaluable resource.  I purchased 50 seeds from an online vendor for about $15, because they claimed to be organically grown in Hawaii and of the highest quality. I would rather pay a few dollars more just for safety and a quality trip. Once I recieved the seeds in the mail, my friend and I decided to spend the next day at the park with the woodrose seeds to see what we might learn.   The next day turned out to be beautiful, cool, and sunny, although a bit windy. We drove out to a nearby park situated at next to a bay. We had considered walking there so we wouldn\'t have to deal with any auto related distractions,  but we decided to drive at the last minute to have a shelter nearby in case we needed it. Once at the park we crushed each seed with a pair of pliers, put them all in our mouths with a bit of water, and chewed for about 5 minutes before swallowing. After lots of research I was still unsure about the preparation of the seeds. There was no fuzzy outer coating to the seeds to remove and the brown outer husk seemed like it would be next to impossible to remove without losing most of the contents. I was a little worried about the nausea, but I figured that no matter what happened it would be a learning experience.   So we walked out into the park chewing our seeds and talking a bit. We found a nice sunny spot on a hill, sat down, and waited. After about 15 minutes we each began to feel a bit of nausea setting in which was expected but unpleasent nonetheless. I managed to take my mind off of the pain for awhile by listening to a bit of slow dub music, but we evenutally decided to take a walk to shake off the increasing nausea and the cramps that had developed in our legs. About 45 minutes had passed at this point. We were both feeling fairly weak and sick. Things felt strange and a little dreamy at this point, but nothing psychedelic.  A few minutes into the walk my friend vomited and felt much better for it. I didn\'t puke the entire time, although sometimes the pain made me wish I had. I just have a stomach of steel and didn\'t have the luxury of vomit. It proved to work to my advantange in the end though, because I didn\'t come down until a few hours after my friend.  We wandered around the park for another ten minutes or so in a dreamy state. It was very windy and we were both very exhauseted by this point, so we decided to make our way back to my car at the other end of the park. At times it felt like the wind was going to blow me over.  My car was only a few hundered yards away, but we had to stop once on the way to rest. I felt as if I was carrying the ring to mordor. It was a long slow walk back. It took us at least three times as long to get to my car than it should have, but it was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment to finally make it there.  So we sat in the car. Exhausted. The nausea was less prounounced now but we were both amazingly weak. I had trouble lifting bottles of water and sitting up straight. I just had to keep telling myself that to get to the top of the mountain, you have to make a difficult trek. And the more difficult the trek, the higher the mountain. Most of the time was just spent lying still, thinking about not really wanting to do this again, and listening to some music. I felt wretched and weak like the weight of the universe was on top of me. I had the urge to stretch my legs at one point, so we got out of the car and walked to the water for a bit. Still weak. Still dreamy. Nothing psychedelic.   When we returned from the water, about 2 hours had past since we ingested the seeds. We both laid back in our seats and went back to spacing out and feeling tired. About 5 minutes later it hit me. I was soaring! I was laying back in my seat, but the pain and weakness was gone. I lay there awestruck for a period. Those of you that have had an ethnogenic eperience will know that it defies words, so I wont bother trying. Once I settled into it I sat up in my seat and looked at my friend, he was apparently feeling much better at that point too because we started into a conversation on metaphysics all of a sudden.  We spent another 2 hours just sitting in the car talking and watching things happen on the outside. We took Jesus\'s teaching of judge not lest ye be judged to its furthest point, so that it became an instruction of how to merge with the trancendental mind.  Too many thoughts and things crossed my mind to discuss them all. After the two hours we went back to his house. We were both still tripping, but he claimed that he was okay to drive and I trusted him. We followed the path of least resistance all the way back to his place and made it there without any trouble. It wasn\'t exactly the fastest way, because we went through all sorts of neighborhoods to get there, but it was quite nice.  His grandmother was there at his house, so we pretended to watch TV for awhile to appear normal. It was really too ridiculous and boring to watch so we snuck back to his room and hung out for awhile. He ate quite a bit of food and started coming down at this point, so I told him thanks and drove back home. I was still tripping so I took the path of least resistance to get there.   [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    My parents were home, so I preteneded to be normal for awhile with them. I had some dinner(even though I wasn\'t hungry), and watched part of a football game. I really didn\'t feel like paying attention to it, but I knew to make some sort of generic reaction to the game when everyone else did. I knew they wouldn\'t expect me to be tripping, so I just played it cool. After awhile I told them I was feeling a bit sick and was going to take a nap. I just wanted some time to myself.   I took a quick shower. Checked my eyes, which were almost completely black, because my pupils were so huge. Then laid down for awhile. The most meaningful moment happened after I laid down and shut my eyes. It was about 8.5 hours after we had consumed the seeds at this point. All I can say is I percieved the center that everything issues forth from. The void. If you can visualize the world as a yin/yang, I percieved the invisible axis, which it rotates around.  I was stunned with this vision an all of its implications. About an hour later I got up and played normal for a few mintues with my parents, and then hung out in my room and watched office space(my friend later told me that he watched it too). I was happy. I was still tripping some. And I realized what an archetype the movie was.   When I turned off the TV and closed my eyes I returned to the void which was a blessing. I percieved it until I fell asleep, which was about 11 hours after taking the seeds.  So I should give some final thoughts on the woodrose seeds I suppose. The woodrose seeds definely work. The beginning was very difficult and a dull pain remained in my stomach and legs for the remainder of the time, but I took it as a neccesary part of the learning process. I don\'t know if there is a good way to combat the bad side effects, but I don\'t know that I would even want that. The trip was more intense than my past experiences with mushrooms but I think I may have learned more from it. I usually write quite a bit on mushrooms, but all I managed to write with the woodrose seeds was \'1\' and \'.\' I think I learned more despite this.   My friends trip didn\'t last as long. I suppose this was because he vomited and weighed about 10 or 15 punds more than me. But he enjoyed it nonetheless. He had some great conversations with his family after I left. And had a sense of renewal the next morning."
57178,A Slip into Schizophrenia and a Sea Change,laughingbuddha,"Dec 12, 2006",H.B. Woodrose (HBW),"This happened to me three years ago. I always intended to write out my experience, but life happened and I never got around to it. Yet there\'s rarely a day that goes by where I don\'t think about that fateful night when I swallowed 12 HBR seeds and EVERYTHING changed. Luckily, things changed for the better...but that easily might not have been the case.     At the time, my friends lived in this really cool, really old house. It had a back room which was about as wide as a washer and dryer and maybe three or four times as long. My friends had converted it into this totally righteous \'opium/makeout den\' by hanging blankets and sheets all along the walls and draped from the ceilings. They put several layers of blankets and cushions on the floor, an electric blanket on top of all that, and then on the very top this crazy gold  colored sateen blanket they\'d picked up at goodwill or something. They\'d even gone so far as to invest in some curtains so that the room was partitioned into 1/3 entryway and washer and dryer and 2/3 pot smoker\'s heaven. It was very womblike, in a way, what with the blankets draped down from the high ceiling, the diffused darkness, and the warmth and all. We used to sit back there and get stoned nearly every day--it had great vibes.    My psychonaut buddy--I\'ll call him L-- had gotten the HBR seeds and done them a few times. Id done them with him once already, I took five seeds and virtually nothing happened, just a slight buzzing, mainly a physical reaction. Since five hadn\'t been enough, and he had 12 seeds left, he offered to prepare them in a water extraction for me, and I took his offer. I can\'t remember what time it was when I took them but let\'s say 10:00 pm for the sake of clarification. As for my mental state at the time, I was in fairly good spirits. It was the end of the semester and Id done very well, so I was looking forward to rewarding myself with some psychedelic action. I think my naivete reveals itself there, but I digress.    I think Ive read elsewhere that if you take a hallucinogen or an alkaline drug like LSA and you start to feel its effects almost immediately or within, say, a half an hour--be warned. You\'re about to trip balls. Im not sure if this is true or not but I distinctly remember feeling the aforementioned buzzing sensation almost immediately after drinking the solution (probably about 12 oz of water). We had lots of friends over that night, as it was Christmas break, so there was probably a dozen of us hanging out that night. We talked in the kitchen for awhile and then moved to the living room to watch TV. After a half an hour I remember feeling euphoric, energized, slightly anxious. L was watching me and I think he could tell something was happening, cause when I looked at him he said something along the lines of, \'How are you feeling?\' I said, \'Good, Im not really feeling anything.\' I wasn\'t sure myself if what I was feeling was the LSA or just excitement mixed with anxiety. In retrospect I can definitely say there was something going on...    After a bit we moved into the \'opium den\' to smoke pot and play telephone. I can\'t recall if I smoked, but I don\'t think I did. I wanted to remain purely on the LSA, no depressants or anything. This is maybe an hour, an hour and a half into my trip. It is at this time that things started to shift from euphoria to a barely-controlled state of panic. Keep in mind that there were about eight bodies crammed into our little smoking den, everyone\'s laughing, joking, having a good time. So we start playing telephone--you know, where someone whispers something into the ear of the person sitting next to him or her and then they whisper it to the next, and so on, until you get to the last person and they say aloud what it is they were told. Normally this is fun, but in my state I think the concentration required was simply too much for me to handle. Im not sure if I felt claustrophobic or what but I definitely felt a rising sense of panic, like I was either doing something horribly, horribly wrong or something horribly wrong was going to happen to me...in any case, as the game went on I would cycle from relatively calm to increasingly panicked. Towards the end I had to muster every ounce of my will to not get up and start screaming, \'WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! GET THE F*#K AWAY FROM ME! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!!\' I seriously felt the urge to jump up and either defend myself from imminent attack or start stabbing the person next to me. This was alarming in itself.    Eventually my friends grew weary of telephone and went back to the living room to play video games. I think at this point I somewhat calmed down and went to the bathroom. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and thinking something along the lines of, \'Okay dude, it\'s on now. This is for real. This is the night.\' I went back into the opium den to find L sitting there, talking with our friend P. I sat down and tried to calm myself but I just couldn\'t. I felt incredibly restless and impulsive--sort of like being on acid but way worse. I think L was starting to become rather concerned with me, especially when I sort of curled up in a ball and closed my eyes. Knowing how fond I am of the movie blade runner, he put on the soundtrack that Id brought over in my CD case. Now, if you\'ve ever seen the movie or listened to the soundtrack, you\'d know that it\'s all about DEATH, dying, the life cycle, the brevity of life, that sort of stuff. Probably not the best music to listen to when you\'re slipping into a schizophrenic state of paranoid delusion. L asked how I felt and I think it was at this point I confessed I felt very alarmed, like I needed to be restrained. \'PUT ME DOWN! PUT ME DOWN!\' I yelled at one point during the trip, I can\'t remember when.    Anyways, it\'s safe to say L was probably very confused when I DEMANDED that he leave the room. This was totally and utterly random. I wanted to talk to P, but of course this was not the time or place to say the things I wanted to say to her. But I couldn\'t make that decision because I was TRIPPING BALLS. Thus it was that I confessed some personal things to P that I will not, of course, include here! I remember how she laughed at some of the things I said, I think partially because she thought I was funny and partially because I was making her nervous.     Then it happened that in the midst of pouring my heart out to P I went into a completely tripped out, non-responsive fetal position. I remember kneeling on my knees while I confessed myself to her and then started to slowly, slowly fall over, drool coming out of my mouth all the while. I was utterly powerless--I was in the almighty grips of LSA. The panic which had earlier washed over me now turned into fear I was dying (no doubt aided on a subconscious level by the Blade Runner soundtrack reverberating through the room.) It was Christmas too, which happens to be my favorite time of year. I thought \'what a shame to die during my favorite time of year, my mother will be heartbroken.\' I may have mumbled as much to P. I remember she kept asking me \'What? What? I can\'t understand what you said.\'    This is probably around midnight or one o\'clock am. P keeps trying to rouse me, L is practically yelling at me, but I am definitely not responding, let alone moving. I can hear everything that\'s going on, however. I can hear them talking about me--\'I think he\'s dying,\' P said to L. \'No, he\'s not dying!\' said L. \'I think he was just hit really hard by the seeds is all.\' I can hear them talking about me, wondering if Im dying or dead, and this is all fueling the perception that Im slowly cycling down, my life is ebbing away.     All sorts of colors and dreams occurred during this time...they\'d be more vivid if Id written this immediately afterwards, of course. Some were of plants--I remember this weird, quasi-sexual flower thing, like a kaleidoscopic, rainbow colored flower swaying in the wind but with this thirsty, depraved, dragon-like tongue wagging out in the middle where the pollen would be...weird. I remember dreaming about discussing the paradox of life with one of my professors, I think in a way I was dreaming of trying to explain the ultimate vision I was being shown to him, and he just smiled at me. I remember how the noises of my friends in the other room filtered into my trip as little sound bytes--an \'OH!\' here and \'DAMN YOU!\' there and \'AWW, C\'MON!\' here, not to mention the sounds from the video game they were playing. I had  visions of co-workers laughing at me--they were laughing at me because I was dying.     It seemed cruel but there was nothing I could do about it. It didn\'t help when one of my friends came back to see what was going on and, finding out Id taken some weird seeds and was possibly dying said, \'Well, that\'s what happens when you take some f&#@ed up seeds.\' Again, I could hear everything but my normal mental pathways of processing were definitely being processed in a manner entirely dependent on the LSA\'s choosing. I also have an alarming memory of jumping up and trying to smash the CD player, possibly over the head of P. She never mentioned anything like this to me, so I may have dreamt it, but again I don\'t know. She just might not have wanted to talk about it. Nonetheless the CD player was not smashed, so there\'s some evidence I only dreamt trying to bludgeon my poor friend with a boombox.    I liken this period of the trip--which probably lasted for about three or so hours--to the idea of an old dog being put to sleep. I distinctly remember feeling like a dog. Dying, that is. Maybe the position that I was curled in made me think of a dog curled up as it sleeps, I dunno. The best I can do to summarize in words what was happening was that what I was hearing around me was contributing to a sensation of dying, of consciousness starting to slow down and ebb away. My connection to my body became increasingly disassociated, Ive never done ketamine but I have an idea now of it might it be like. I was all wrapped up in the visions and the sensations the LSA was giving me. Alas, the beautiful failure of language is that it can never truly convey what it is we\'re trying to talk about, and this case is no different.    At some point L got fed up with babysitting my drooling, comatose self and went to bed, leaving P and another friend of mine--K--to watch over me. Eventually (probably around 5 am) they must\'ve retreated to the living room to get some rest. This is when things get really, really weird. My slip into schizophrenia was nearly complete.    I remember opening my eyes, looking up at the blankets draped from the ceiling and thinking \'Okay...so is this it? Is this what happens after you die?\' then I jumped up and literally RIPPED OFF ALL OF MY CLOTHING. I broke my watch and a hemp necklace a friend had made for me in Africa doing so. I was EXTREMELY thirsty and very disoriented. I walk out of the back room, through the kitchen, and into the living room where K and P are sleeping. I don\'t know if they\'d just fallen asleep or if I said something to rouse them but they definitely woke up when they saw me standing there TOTALLY NAKED. \'Dude?\' K said to me, to which I responded, loudly (and now infamously) \'WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?!\'     I absolutely did not know who the hell these people were. All I knew was that I had to get out of there...and I was damn thirsty. I tried to get into my friends room but K persuaded me to not open his door, so then I walked into the kitchen, grabbed a half-empty beer bottle off the counter and proceeded to dip it into the fish tank next to it, trying to get some water. Incidentally I broke the fish tank\'s heater while doing so. \'No, let\'s not drink that,\' K said to me, trying to take the bottle from me. I think I then threw it on the floor. \'I NEED FLUIDS!\' I shouted and went into the bathroom, attempting to fill up the bathtub. K followed me and prevented me from doing so, again saying something like, \'No, that\'s really not a good idea\' (the tub was broke anyways). \'I need fluids,\' I said, adding, \'But what are fluids?\' I remember words and language began slowly filtering back to me, but this must\'ve taken an hour or more. Keep in mind that Im naked during this entire time. Thus K said, \'Hey, let\'s go back and get your clothes on, okay?\' I followed him. I can\'t remember if I was clothed or still naked when I a) punched him, to which he replied, \'Okay let\'s not do that again\' and b) lunged for the power cord of the space heater and promptly bit down upon it. Yes, I actually attempted to bite through a live wire while under the influence of LSA.    I think what I was doing with the wire thing was trying something absolutely outrageous to prove to myself I wasn\'t dreaming. K eventually succeeded in helping to get my clothes back on, during which time I made similar comments as, \'What are fluids?\' I have an interest in words and language, so perhaps this isn\'t surprising. But it also makes sense that as elements of my psyche began to re-establish themselves, language would be one element that would re-manifest itself in my consciousness. I was struck by the quaintness of clothes, words, my friends, the house...everything seemed quite quaint, in a pleasant way. As you can see I was behaving almost like a baby in many respects, a child certainly. In fact, one of the themes of the entire trip was the fear over the breaking down of what I understand to be culturally acceptable norms of behavior. The line between appropriate and not appropriate--as in do you stab this person or not--normally quite a clear line, mind you, was clearly put in jeopardy while I was on LSA. This has had lasting consequences for me.    For the entire next day I felt serene and peaceful--quite the stark contrast to the previous night\'s paranoid schizophrenic breakdown. I remember colors were softer, the sun was brighter, I felt very gentle, calm, and peaceful. It was a very pleasant after-glow, one which I have never experienced from any of the other sundry drugs I have dabbled with over the years.    One last thing I should mention. This experience unhinged me. While the day-after was pleasant, the weeks were not. At one point about three weeks later I was delivering a pizza and a wave of absolute terror washed over me--the same kind of terror I felt as I lay dying on the blankets in the back room. Only this time I wasn\'t on drugs, and yet I was still freaking out. The paradox of death was upon me and was having real, psychological consequences. It might be fair to call these episodes residual panic attacks, but whatever you want to call them they lasted in earnest for weeks. Death had never troubled me so much before, but now I couldn\'t get the concept out of my head. Questions like, \'What happens when you die\' and, \'Is there a soul?\' and, \'If so, what happens to it when the body dies?\' now preoccupied my mind, and not in a pleasant way. Every time Id think about death the same feelings of helplessness, panic, and anxiety Id felt while on LSA would wash over me. Eventually I overcame this paranoia by realizing that I was making a conscious choice to feel this way, I was not on LSA anymore and therefore could decide what to focus on thus how to feel. This has, in fact, become a guiding mantra for my life. Thus I say this experience was a \'sea change\' in my life. I wouldn\'t want to do it again, and I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend it to anyone, but I wouldn\'t take it back for a billion dollars. That fateful night three years ago made me who I am today. Thanks HBR and LSA, you devils you."
56387,Projected Karma,Peachy,"Oct 20, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"This is a report of my third experience with LSA extracted from Baby Woodrose seeds and my sisters first.  I began using Baby Woodrose seeds as a substitute for my beloved LSD, which is hard to find these days, especially since I moved 2 years ago and dont have good connections here.  I have found LSA to be as deep and interesting as LSD but with a slightly different focus, more introspective and personal in many ways.    My sister is four years younger than me (she is 21) and had only began experimenting with drugs beyond pot about 2 years prior to this experience.  When I learned of her extracurricular activities, I suggested we trip together and she agreed but we couldnt agree on a substance.  She liked mushrooms and was scared to try LSD.  I love LSD but have never enjoyed mushrooms.  For some reason they tend to make me feel extremely vulnerable and confused.    Since we live on opposite ends of the country, we gave up on tripping together for a while.  But when she came to visit me a few weeks ago I decided to see if she would be up for LSA.  I proceeded to crush up 9 seeds for each of us and place them in 1 cup jars.  I filled the jars with distilled water and left them to sit in a cabinet until she arrived.  This simple extraction method seems to negate much of the infamous nausea that many people experience with woodrose seeds.  I have not used distilled water before but I had heard that it prevents the loss of LSA.  The end result was stronger than previous attempts, but I also soaked longer this time so Im not sure if the distilled water made any difference.     When my sister arrived we discussed it and she agreed so we set the date.  The date we chose allowed for an eight day extraction  a record for me.  Fast forward three days to the evening we chose to trip.  I strained the liquid through a fine mesh (very fine  I use it to press grains for home brewing) discarded the seed mush and microwaved both tea mugs.  LSA extract is less disgusting hot.    We sip the tea slowly (it seems to get worse as you drink it) and begin to feel the effects before we have even completed the mugs.  It begins as a tightening in the stomach.  Like that feeling you get as the roller coaster begins to descend.  The TV begins to look brighter and more interesting.  My sister complains that her stomach feels weird and eats some popcorn to settle it.  She says it worked.  We both find ourselves shifting positions constantly.  I am not uncomfortable but I have so much energy.    My sister decides she wants to do my nails.  We bought nail kits earlier that day which have special buffer pads to smooth the nail surface and another to give it shine.  She quickly becomes totally absorbed in buffing my nails.  I find the sensation of pressure on my nail very odd.  Not good or bad, just strange and very prominent.  I notice that my stomach feels normal now.  The queasiness lasted all of 20 minutes.  I find I can concentrate on many things at once , the star trek episode on TV, the things my sister is saying, and my own train of thought all at once.    I start to laugh too long and too hard at minor comedies.  Sometimes I laugh for no reason.  My sister laughs too but at me as much as at the joke.  Though smiling and laughing she is more serious than me.  And totally focused on completing the nail job.  Towards the end I begin to get to antsy.  I need to do something.  I cant sit still.   Though LSA is supposedly a sedative I find it energizes me more than LSD even.  I suggest we go swimming and my sister is all for it but she MUST complete the nails first.  I am so excited to swim I force her to finish while I change with my other hand.    Soon we are out the door and walking to the apartment pool.  Luckily it was totally deserted.  The feel of the cool water on my skin felt amazingly refreshing.  My sister gets in more timidly and looks stiff.  I ask how shes feeling and she says tense.  We talk and she loosens up in a few minutes.  The sky and the water are beautiful.  The nighttime clouds look like a deep purple and seem to sway.  The water is amazingly blue.  This is the height of visual effects for me.  Interestingly, LSA visuals are more like shroom visuals than LSD visuals (for me anyway).  The distortions are more about color and breathing, while LSD is more patterns and melting.    We had been watching star trek DVDs a lot the last few days (we both LOVE the show) and topic of an old board game came up.  We had owned it as children and played it all the time.  There was a video tape that came with it and was necessary to play the game.  Eventually we lost the tape.  We searched many times but to no avail.  My sister expressed a desire to have that game again, so that we could play it.    After we lost the tape and gave up, our parents had a garage sale and we sold the game, minus the tape.  I know this sounds silly, but I have thought back to that day many times in the intervening years.  I felt bad for selling the game in its unusable state.  Deliberate fraud, especially one that hurts others at no gain to me (I never saw the money) is totally contradictory to my sense of morality.  I have thought that the children who bought it where probably as excited about as my sister and I where when we bought it.  And they must have been very disappointed.    I told all this to my sister.  And it felt great.  I felt like something I had been carrying around for years was off my chest.  My sister told me we felt bad about it at the time, and we sold it because our parents told us to.  This detail I had totally forgotten.  And it redeemed me.  Certainly, I should have told my parents it wasnt whole.  Its still my bad karma.  But the fact that I didnt do it vindictively, that I wasnt sadistic to some degree, helped to restore my sense of self as a good and moral person.    Then I remembered something else.  Years after we sold the game, when I was packing for a move, I found the tape.  At the time it just made me feel worse about what I had done.  But now I saw it in a new light.  It was my karma.  I learned a karmic lesson by finding the tape again.  I read once that karma is simply a consequence of an action.  The consequence of my selling the game when it was useless, was to receive the tape without the game, making the tape useless.  This cathartic revelation elated me and made me feel carefree.  One less karmic lesson to worry about.  And I finally felt like I understand what karma is.    As we swim back and forth we discussed a variety of topics but one that got us both going for awhile was scientific factoids.  She is a biology major and I am a grad student in physics so we have a lot to share.  This info, fascinating in its own right, was downright awesome.  I felt utterly amazed at the tidbits that she feed my imagination with.  And I rediscovered the things I knew, learning them again with the wonder of a child.  One of the many facts we discussed was a study done in mice that found that mice fed the meat of mice that had been though a given maze actually got through it faster their first time.  I mean, the implications!  We spent around an hour prancing around the pool wrapped up in our convo.    Then two of my neighbor friends walked out to the pool to say hello, along with my husband who was sober.  I felt strange because my neighbors are not the psychedelic type.  Though they drink a lot of beer.  After a few uncomfortable moments I simply asked if they were comfortable with our state of mind and they said it was fine.  I felt much better.  We swam a bit more and talked with the newcomers until we decided we had to get out to pee.  On the way back to the apartment I notice that sandals feel totally strange and went barefoot.  The sidewalk felt great.  My sister told me she didnt want to go back out cause she barely knew my friends and was tripping after all, so we dried off and sat down to some more star trek.    My husband came in and made fun of something my sister said and that made me feel icky and mad.  I was about to have the second revelation of the night.  I thought about how he often communicates through verbal jabs which are meant in jest, but can feel harsh at times.  I begin to realize that I do this too.  I can think of at least two times that I have accidental offended someone with my sarcastic tone.    I look over at my sister who seems happy to lay back and watch star trek.  I have felt frustrated this visit that she seems to consider many of the activities I planned second to watching as many of the voyager episodes she can while here.  I see in her my own laziness and tendency towards obsession.  When I buy a video game I play for 5 hours a day for the first week.    The connection between these thoughts suddenly pops out at me.  Jungian projection.  The things that irritate me about the ones I love are the things I hate about myself.  I have always acknowledged that projection occurs and that it must play a role in my own perceptions but never before have I considered what I project and onto whom.  I feel that a whole new way of analyzing my self has been discovered.  Armed with this new tool I can see into unexplored areas of my psyche.  The possibilities are nearly limitless.    This is all seen with a touch of sadness of course.  I am confronting parts of my shadow self and that is unnerving.  I stare at the TV but Im not really watching.  I need to be with my thoughts right now and this is a way of avoiding conversation with my sister.  Soon she falls asleep.  I lay back and breathe.  I notice the fullness of my breaths.  I find that on psychedelics I breath like a yogi.  Deep and full.  Equal inhale and exhale.  It tends to feel speedy almost, taking deep breaths.  Like Im taking in too much life energy to handle.  After perhaps another hour I finally felt tired and went to bed.    I wake the next morning refreshed.  My sister shows no ill effects either.  Since then I have read further on the conceptions of projection and the shadow self and continue to learn.  This trip really solidified in my mind the place of LSA in my psychedelic toolbox.  While LSD shows me connections that bring me closer to an understanding of the world around me, LSA shows me connections that bring me closer to an understanding of my place in the world."
25025,Full Blown Psychedelic Experience,Axium,"Aug 28, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"Summary: Totally mind blowing, life changing experience. Lasted about 10 hours with vivid visuals both closed and open eye that were very integrated into my normal vision. Lucid VERY deep thoughts and visions that almost seemed like dreams. Very physically disorienting, yet I could still walk and socially interact for the most part. Overall, the best psychoactive experience I\'ve ever had.    I\'m still experiencing a disoriented slight \'hangover\' like effect while typing this, so bear with any rambles/misspellings/bad grammar. The hangover is more of a very unmotivated, feeling of indifference about life and physically extremely relaxed. Thoughts are still a bit difficult to control, but mostly its just hard to focus on anything - like being drunk.    28 seeds total between two people, my self and my roommate, J, prepared as follows. (All measurements were eyeballed. I have not even a guess as to how much of any materials I used or ingested):    1. Crushed seeds as good as possible with needle nose pliers and soaked in naphtha lighter fluid for 6 hours, shaking occasionally.    2. Remaining seed mush evaporated for 1.5 until no smell of lighter fluid remained. I was surprised at how fast it evaporated.    3.Seed mush then soaked in small amount of water for 15 hours, also shaken occasionally and kept in a cool dark place.    I dosed at 7:40pm on the 4th of July. I swallowed everything, chewing the seed mush for a few minutes and swallowed that as well. Taste was tolerable... Kind of like dirt or mud. My roomy J got sick after 2 hours. His trip wasn\'t nearly as powerful as mine, probably because he through it up or because I ate more actual seed mush or a combination. I had no nausea or sickness at all. We dosed after having ate approx 1.5 hours earlier.    Ok. Now for the good stuff. Starting out, about 30 min into it, I felt like I was just floating around - walking on air, so to speak. I felt like a million bucks. Total euphoria. This went on for an hour or so. Time and numbers meant nothing. 5 minutes seemed like an hour and an hour seemed like 5 minutes. Couldn\'t do math, so when I tried to figure out where I was vs. where I should have been (based on hours and hours of research prior to this experience), it was useless. This was the first phase out of 5. The visuals at this point were mostly based on lights. They seemed exceedingly bright and lucid and ominous. The fireworks were awesome and totally drew me in. I couldn\'t perceive distance very well - I would never drive on this shit. Headlights seemed to float by and weave all over the road.     I realized then that my visuals were merely daily optical illusions enhanced 1000 fold due to disorientation of the drug. It was amazing. Music was full and totally surrounded me. CEVs were of faint textile patterns - sometimes like a warping checkerboard sometimes like a kaleidoscope (not sure on spelling) and then sometimes like a kaleidoscope on crack, shapes splashing and rotating and spinning around my head. I could actually look around with my eyes closed like I was in a big room of visuals. Faint, but awesome. My thoughts were in control for the most part and I was calm and happy and had this big stupid grin on my face that I couldn\'t wipe to save my life. I was actually tripping for the first time and I was LOVING IT!    Phase two began when we got back home about an hour and a half later. (around 10pm). J was peaking and I was only just beginning my journey. I still felt like I was just floating around. My senses all merged into one. We went for a walk and now the visuals were taking a little bit more shape of their own - more than just distorted optical illusions. Puddles seemed to pop off of the ground and hang in the air.     The visuals from here on were mostly integrated into normal scenery - trees seemed full and alive, hard lines seemed to curve and bend around - flat surfaces seemed to warp and wave slowly and gently (like the water effects in the game quake by ID Software). This too was faint, but very much there. My thoughts at this point were blissful and I felt so alive. Taste was incredible as my senses were merged - it took over my whole body to eat a mint. Same with sound and music. It was as though could taste and touch sound and hear and smell taste and so on. Phase 3 came on so gently I didn\'t even notice it until now that I look back.     In phase 3, I began to see faint colors shooting out from the fonts on my computer and fading to out to the rest of the image on the screen. Shadows subtlety danced and played with me. When I shut off the lights in my room, the dimensions totally went wild - like a cartoon drawing. Music was even more alive than before, although my senses weren\'t as merged at this point. Now it was all thoughts and visuals/visions. I could barely read or spell. I still have a hard time with that. CEVs rocked with the music like winamp visualizations. Still the same textile, checkerboard and kalidescopic images as before only more obvious now.     I talked on line for a bit unsure if I made any sense at all. My thoughts began to merge with the visuals. This is where thoughts started totally overcoming me and when I\'d think, I could see the thought and feel it instead of just think it. Social interaction was slowly becoming more and more difficult but still possible. I just kept quiet for the most part. Wandering around, enjoying my trip. I had my second of 3 bad spots in the trip here. The fist was in phase 2 and was simply the typical \'omg, what have I done\'. This second feeling was of fear and disorientation.     I remembered LSA constricts veins and I looked at my arm and it began to shrink. I got very scared, but managed to keep my head on and tell my self it was only a trip and I would be fine. This lasted for maybe a half an hour and then I was OK. I had a very notable feeling in my physical body, like pressure all over. It was a very metallic feeling. This is what brought the bad trip on. The waves were the most obvious at phase 3. Tripping hard almost like the peak in phase 4, but then back down to phase 2 and back up through phase 3 to 4 and back down to 2, until finally I hit phase 4 hardcore and stayed there for a good 2-3 more hours.... Like I said, time perception was out of whack. That is merely estimation.    Thoughts now were totally out of control. I was totally out of touch with normal reality, except I could still physically see with my eyes and if I concentrated really hard I could make sense of what I was looking at with my normal consciousness, but I felt a million miles away from it. I lost touch of my past and short term memory. I couldn\'t remember anything not even a second ago no matter how hard I tried. I had no future and no past. Just now.     Visuals were now thoughts and visions for the most part. I could see my bedroom, but it was just a warped distorted image in front of my eyes and my thoughts over powered it. I was laying down on my bed with jimmy eat world playing. I more or less didn\'t notice the music, but when I did manage tune into it, it was amazing. I heard things in the music that I\'ve never heard before and it was so beautiful. I rolled over and stared at my zebra stripped sheets. The stripes waved around and danced with me and the music. Then they all merged together and everything around them merged with them into this huge black spot that took over almost 100 percent of my vision. The spot grew and shrank then grew again.     I started to feel very heavy. I sat up in my bed and looked around. I looked at my shadow and I it felt like it was staring back at me. I could play with the visuals, but never harness or control them. My shadow would move seemingly independently of me, but then I realized it was really me moving. I laid back down and had my second bad trip. I began to think about death and thought I was dieing, or at least it was time to choose if I wanted to die. And I didn\'t want to. I had no clue what was on the other side and wasn\'t ready to find out. I remembered I was still tripping and snapped out of it after a few minutes. The weight on my body was slowly increasing to the point of total cataplexy. I had to put my entire being into movement. I was on my stomach and wanted to roll over but I couldn\'t. It probably took me 20 minutes to make it, although it could have only been 30 seconds: Who knows?    Phase 5 began - the comedown. I was fading in and out of consciousness . My dreams were lucid and real. I was still tripping in my dreams... I realized I was tripping and why, but it was in totally different times and places. When I was finally totally out, I had my comedown in my dreams. As I said, I was totally aware of the trip, but it slowly began to fade out until I woke up at about 7:30am - 12 hours from dose. I slept some more and woke up with just as intense of a hang over. It needs to fade soon but I don\'t care if it ever does. I feel so wonderful! I remember thinking throughout the experience I never want this to end... This is so amazing!    It changed my consciousness  and my thought processes and cleaned my mind and spirit. I feel as though I have died and came back - though I know I didn\'t."
31295,Rebirth and Translucent Beings,Lead_Into_Gold101,"Aug 1, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"I have never been an enthusiastic user of entheogens and psychedelics, but I have indeed used them a number of times over the past several years.  However, the first time, which was mushrooms, I was unaware of what part of my conscious would be stricken.  After that initial trip, I gained a respect for entheogens and psychedelics.  I have cultivated a small dislike for people who use such drugs for no real reason then they want to get \x91fucked up.  I doubt that there are many, but I have met a few over the past several years.     I, personally use entheogens when I feel that I need to use a tool to guide me in my mystic and shamanistic path.      Okay, now I shall dismount from my soapbox, and tell you of my experience.  I had in my possession an amount of 50 HBWR seeds.  I decided that sense I was experienced with various other psychedelics that I would indeed take a rather strong does, but over time. I decided off the bat that 10 would be suitable, and that I would ingest 4 to start, wait two hours and take an additional two if needed.  I set a rule that after 10, if I didnt have a noticeable move from baseline, that I would just put it off until another day.     After ingesting all ten seeds over a time period of about 3 hours, I felt little more then a slight uplift in mood, and a cannabis like thought pattern, without the slow confining inarticulate experience that cannabis often gives me.  So with that thought, I waited an additional hour, and concluded that it perhaps just wasnt the night.      I however was in short, very wrong.  And often I find that putting myself in that mindset of oh well, nothing tonight perhaps next time can be dangerous, but that night, it was not.    I at first watched my Bill Hicks video, which I often keep around while on a journey, because it relaxes me and keeps me sane while setting in, or coming down.      About half way though the movie, which was about 4 and a half hours after the first initial ingestion, I decided to retreat to my room, as my stomach was reaching a discomfort, and I was beginning to shift into a state of mind that required comfort, stillness, and solitude.  I often play Tool when in a trance or entheogen experience, so I did just that for a little comfort.  While listening, I turned off my lights and just lay down under my covers eyes mostly closed.  Lots of color patterns with closed eye and open eye.      Then after a song came on called Merkaba, I heard the music no more as a distortion before me, an oval shaped white light, with fading pulsating dots of white and black on the outer edge.  Its will beckoned that I allow myself to release my firm grip on this reality, and free my self from all ideas and presuppositions that I held.  I felt no fear in this, no malignant feelings, just that of something that I desired to understand.  So I let go.  I released my conciseness and felt pulled though the light.  As soon as I did so, a saw my body from a corner of my room curl up into a fetal position, and with that I was instantaneously launched into a red and yellow warmness, which I concluded was my mothers womb.  I then was reborn and took a huge deep breath and mildly cried for a while.  I was then subject to almost all of my life being watched, not really lived, but just seeing every second that let up too the moment which was the now.      I sort of awoke from my trance one I landed back in the now.  The music was heard again, but now it was offensive, as is the mild noises make me twitch and cringe with each lyric and each riff.  (The approximant time now was +4 hours after I retreated into my room, but I wasnt aware of time that much.)   I made a wise decision to turn off the music, and see where I could go.  I laid back down, and watched the closed eye visuals, and kind of writhed around in happiness of my new found life, and appreciation for The Now.      At that point, I felt two blue, translucent beings lift me out of my body, and inform me, (no words, just feelings, empathy) that I was not yet informed of what I was to need to know yet.  They, (eyes closed) lifted my being out of my body, and I felt as though I was floating over my body, and I felt as though they wanted me to look.      I was then pulled far away, and what felt like long ago.  I personally believe that these beings took me to the initial instant that the universe was born, with intense colors and heat, and a gravity shifting feeling of being pushed back by the blast, which expanded and evolved larger and more 3 demensional as I rushed through it.  Then it all pulled together into one fine needle point, and repeated itself.    They somehow explained to me, that this had happened an infinite number of times, and that I was to understand that the life of my own being, all beings, were someone connected to this same pattern, and that there was no more need for me to keep looking back into the past, for meaning. (Which I often did, I often tried to get \x91back to a time when man was void, and all was unclear, I time where our own conclusions could be drawn about all, and a place where there was no preexisting ideas or conceptions.)  That was a common theme in my meditation, psychedelic trips, and mystic ideals.  However, I was informed that perhaps we are capable of being in that void nature without looking to the past, but rather looking in ourselves and the collective human mind.      After I flew back into my body, at speeds still unbeknownst to me, I kind of jerked, and was almost back to baseline, so I thought.  But, I was back in my room, and aware of the fact that I was a sentient, logical human being.  So, I went outside to indulge in one of my favorite, yet horrible habits, and smoked a cigarette.  It was just beginning to get light out side, so it was about 7 hours after I went to my room.  Then, as it got a little lighter, I noticed that I having very intense distortions of the trees, grass, cars and my body.  I however wasnt really in that mystical state of mind, I was just hallucinating visually.  I decided that despite the fact that it was entertaining, that Id better go take the Bendryl that I had kept, incase of sleeplessness.  (which is almost always a constant while using such substances).   It took about two hours for me to go to sleep.      I woke up around seven hours later, still seeing minor distortions, and feeling a distinct afterglow, but rather groggy.    Also, I failed to mention, there was a lot of stomach discomfort whenever I returned to my room, out of the \x91trips for lack of a better word.  I felt as though I could vomit, if I was so inclined, but I resisted to no ill effect.  But it is a diarrheic, for sure, I purged around 7 hours after the retreat into my room, then again about an hour later.  And there were minor cramps throughout the next day.    I am sorry that I did not keep better track of the timeline, it was rather hard to stay focused on anything from daily life for a while there.  I hope this helps.  I may well do these again, however, the after effects lasted a long time, so I would need about two days free from any obligations.  It was strong, and indeed not a toy.  I would put its intensity at this level somewhere between P. Cubensis and LSD."
52036,Taken Completely by Surprise,Sackajuweeda,"Jul 26, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"I should have given that a little more consideration before I ate 15 ate once.  I finally was able to smoke a little weed last night and I originally planned to eat these seeds as a compliment to the weed.  Little did I know I was in the for one of the most intense trips of my life.   First though, I\'ll give a little background on my experiences with LSA.  A few weeks ago I felt myself actually start fiending for psychedelics.  I\'ve never really had a craving for them like this before, other than when acid stopped coming, but even that wasn\'t nearly as bad as I was feeling it now.  I think it was because I didn\'t have weed to tide me over between trips like I use to.  I asked everyone I could possibly think of for any kind of hallucinogen, but there just wasn\'t anything around.  I remembered my roommate D having said something about these seeds called Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, a long time ago, and that they made him trip face.  I was a little skeptical at first because he said they were legal, but I went searching online for them anyway.  My curiosity had been piqued when I read about them.  I started thinking about where I could get some.      That same day I was looking up information on them, S came back to the house with a shit ton of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds and said that they fuck me up.  I remembered seeing something about them online too while looking at info on the HB Woodrose seeds.  It turned out they contained the same chemical, LSA.  The one thing I kept noticing about both of the seeds though is that they are notorious for causing nausea and vomiting.  Those two things have always been what bring me down the most while tripping and makes it less enjoyable then it should be.  That\'s why I\'m not a huge fan of mushrooms, as they always fuck my stomach up so bad.  Anyway, the internet had a pretty legitimate looking method for extracting just the LSA out of the seeds.   The extraction method said that it was a good way to eliminate the nausea, so we gathered the supplies and made the attempt. Three days after trying the extraction, we finally got to try and take the LSA.  It ended up being very weak, I wouldn\'t even put it above tripping on a gram of mushrooms, if even that.  I wanted it to make it more intense than it really was, so I kept trying to convince myself I was tripping face but I really wasn\'t.  I did have a lot of nitrous with them though, so that helped to some degree but I would hardly call what I had a \'trip\'.      After that I dismissed the LSA as pretty worthless and not even worth the time.  I went back online, though and for some reason was drawn back to the HB Woodrose seeds.  If all these people had tripped face like they said had, including D, I was sure there was something to them. People will say ridiculous things about tripping where if Ive tripped before I can tell what they\'re saying is complete bullshit or legitimate.  Reading accounts on various websites seemed to intense to deny that there might be something to these seeds.      During spring break I found this glorious online shop that I have a feeling is going to be supplying me with everything I\'ll be needing for a while.  I  looked around on the site for a little bit and found the HB Woodrose section.  They had a few different types, but the very last one I came across was the only one that made any mention of LSA.  They were also the most expensive.  I ordered a pack of fifty and had them sent to my house.  After ordering them, I figured I\'ll be finding out soon enough whether these are the real deal or not so I put them out of my mind.       I came back the Saturday before break was over and found out my seeds had gotten there while I was gone.  Only S was back yet and he had to work that night and I don\'t like to trip alone so I was going to wait until someone was around to eat them.  However, as he was leaving, I was bored as hell and couldn\'t find anything to do so I figured why not eat them.  I crushed up six seeds in our coffee grinder, put them in a shot glass, filled the rest of the glass up with water and took the shot.  I had heard of a way taking them; letting them absorb through the mouth and then spit it out.  It supposedly helped bypass the nausea too.  I held the nasty mixture in my mouth for a half hour then spit it out.    After an hour or so I didn\'t feel anything other than a little disassociated.  I remember thinking to myself if this is as intense as its going to get there is no point in even holding the shit in my mouth for thirty minutes.  I would have rather been sober.  I tried grinding up six more seeds and put them in a shot glass again, except I took the shot itself this time.  An hour later I was still feeling the same dissociation, except this time I vomited a gross bile colored fluid.  I definitely wasn\'t tripping and vomit made me feel like these seeds weren\'t even worth it.  I put them in a drawer and forgot about them until last night.      I smoked weed last night and it was good.  I had been psyching myself up all day thinking it was going to be awesome and all that, and while yes it was glorious to be high again, I couldn\'t even see why I use to feel like I needed it so bad.  While the urge to smoke it had been dying before, now it\'s completely gone.  I just want to get clean now, get this shit behind me, so when I can smoke it again, I can smoke it worry-free and without the possibility of fucking myself over anymore.  Anyway, as I was being all high, it was either D or S that said something about eating the seeds.  I figured it might be worth a try again.  I was totally skeptical that I was going to even feel anything though.  We had been talking about taking a road trip to get some good caps, and I figured these seeds wouldn\'t fuck us up enough so I was down for a trip even while on the seeds.  In retrospect, I\'m lucky that D didn\'t want to go.  If I had been the one driving we would have probably died, or at least been stranded because I was tripping to hard to drive.  Since D didn\'t want to go, I said I was going to eat a shit ton to see what the deal was.    S and I ended up eating fifteen while D has twelve.  D had said he had a real trip off eight only, but I either just didn\'t believe it or thought he had something else instead.  This is another time when I should have listened and taken his word for it.   Fifteen seeds is totally unnecessary, and last night was the second time I ever felt like I was wigging out while tripping.  It was like I ate ten hits of acid at once.  I\'m more experienced with tripping now so I was able to calm down, where as I hadn\'t been able to the last time I had a wig session.  I\'ll never underestimate the power of the seeds ever again.  In the end, even though I was slightly unprepared for the intensity the trip got to, it was totally worth it.  Anyways, heres the trip:  Note:  Time became pretty jumbled, but this is the best as I can remember it.  T-0:30 D said that when he ate the seeds, he let them soak in a water till the outer coat became soft and then scraped off the outer coat.  I put my seeds into a cup with water and let them chill.  T-0:15 We took the seeds out of the water and started scraping at them.  I tried picking at the stuff with my fingernails but all I kept doing was breaking the seed in half.  D showed me the actual part that needed to come off and that made things a little easier.  It wasn\'t until D took a scouring pad and tried rubbing the seeds on them that we finally began to make some progress.  T+0:00 All three of us had our seeds peeled.  We each then ground them up in the coffee filter and put them on some ice cream.  They didn\'t taste too bad but the texture was awful.  Thinking about it right now is actually giving me the urge to vomit, or maybe it was the shitty looking tangerine I ate this morning.   T+0:30 Still not believing I was going to be tripping, I followed S and D into the gaming parlor and watched them play Simpsons: Hit and Run for a little while.  I should have realized then what I was in for because I was having extreme difficulty following and playing the game and I was already feeling way off base-line.  I had to get up and leave the room and go listen to some music for a little while.   T+1:00 I spent the next thirty minutes listening to music and trying to chill.  I could kind of feel the seeds rumbling around in my stomach, but I still wasn\'t feeling any noticeable nausea.  By now, I was definitely noticing pretty intense CEVs (Closed Eye Visuals).  For some reason, I kept on thinking this was going to be the extent the seeds were going to make me trip even though both my mental and physical buzz had been steadily building.  S walked back into the room and I stood up for a minute and walked around.  That\'s when I started feeling a little sick.  T+1:15 I still don\'t know why exactly but I felt like I just had to go outside and get some air.  I stepped outside and leaned over the railing.  That\'s when the urge to vomit finally hit me, but nothing was coming up.  I stepped back inside for two seconds before I felt it all coming up.  I made it back outside and had probably the second nastiest vomit of my life.  Had I been tripping nuts I would have probably thought I was throwing up my stomach from the way it looked, but I felt so much better after I got it all up.    Once I walked back inside, the visuals I was having were the exact same as I remember them on acid.  I\'d look at a spot on my kitchen floor and from that point spreading outward the whole floor would rumble and shake like it had it\'s own wind blowing through it until the wind reached through everything in my entire visual field.  It was spreading up through the walls, the table, and even D and S\'s faces.  I knew I was just reaching my peak.  I was totally blown away by all this.  I ate the seeds thinking that nothing was going to happen, other than I might get a good body buzz or something to go with the weed.  Usually, I know ahead of time if I\'m going to eat something that\'s going to make me trip this hard and it takes me a little mental preparation during the day before hand to get ready for it.  I was definitely impressed with what was going on though, even if I was a little unprepared.   [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]   T+1:30 I had a sudden urge to do some nitrous.  If I had known the seeds were going to be doing this to me, I would have stocked up before hand, but as I said before, I was totally taken by surprise.  D and I got into my car and I started driving to the head shop.  My visuals were getting ridiculous at this point.  Everything had this bright fogginess to it.  I could barely concentrate on driving and it seemed like it took forever to reach the shop.  I started getting a little freaked out when I realized that was only half the journey.  T+1:45 D and I reach the head shop and I dropped D off at the front door and go park.  I was tripping to hard to go inside this time, so I had asked D to do it.  After he got out of the car I sat there for a minute listening to the radio, but everything on was sucking so I stepped out of the car for a minute.  It was pretty cold that night and I caught a chill.  I felt it start making me shake violently, first in my stomach, and then in my hands and legs.  I couldn\'t get warm.  The whole time this was happening I was walking towards the head shop to look at the VOLTAR machine while D was getting the nitrous.  I made it to the end of the parking lot before I had to turn around and run back to the car.  The chills were becoming too much for me to handle.  I  should have known from experience that it was just part of the body come-up, but I couldn\'t think straight at all.  When I was walking past this mexican restaurant I saw a group leave and when I walking by them I thought I heard one of them say \'Look at him, what\'s wrong with him?\'.  I know I was walking normally enough and that it was just an audio hallucination or I had heard what they said wrong.  I made it back to the car, turned it on and put the heat on as high as possible.  I started chilling out then a little bit and D got back to the car a few minutes after that.  T+2:00 I calmed myself down enough to start driving back to the house.  The trip back is a blur in mind right now.  I remember having one of the weirdest visuals of my life though, as I was coming up the last up slope before the long hill that leads down my house, the street lights on the side of the road suddenly spread out in both directions, and the hill I was about to drive up became like a wall to me.  I had totally lost depth perception.  I quickly realized the lights I was seeing  were the street lights in the distance and that the hill wasn\'t a wall at all.  It was weird nonetheless.  I have learned to just make myself laugh at shit like that when it happens.  T+2:15 D and I got back and we split up the nitrous.  I took a balloon first.  I was tripping so hard I didn\'t feel like taking a double.  In fact, a single seemed almost to much for me to handle.  As soon as I started inhaling I could already feel the nitrous kicking in, usually it takes at least a couple of seconds to really feel it, but by this point in time my body and mind was on sensory overload.  I don\'t remember exactly what music was playing, but it was weird what it was doing to me.  I\'ll try to relate the way it made me feel to acid.  With acid, psychedelic music (Hendrix, Floyd..) cuts into my mind like a knife and rips it apart leaving everything in there exposed.  I find that it\'s the music that sets off all the revelations I have about myself and my mind while tripping.  It\'s just a total mind fuck.    With these seeds, it was the same way except I felt it in my body too.  The music was slicing its way into my body.   I had never felt such an intense body buzz until these seeds, even on mushrooms, which I consider mostly a body trip.   The nitrous was intensifying these effects almost beyond my comprehension.  It was here that I started wigging.  The nitrous felt like it was lingering way to long.  When I had it on the AMT, I felt the peak effects of and then they slowly started fading away.  On the HB Woodrose though, I could still feel the nitrous in my body 30 minutes later.  We had put on the movie Logan\'s Run, and I think that movie was what set off my wigging.  I started convincing myself that my heart wasn\'t beating anymore.  I tried taking my pulse, something that usually always calms me down, but I begun tripping so hard, the only thing I felt was the weird ass noises coming from the movie.    I was tripping definitely, but I knew my heart shouldn\'t be.  I got up and started walking around.  I know that heart attacks happen pretty rapidly, and I checked my clock.  I kept telling myself if I\'m still going in ten minutes than I\'m just wigging out and need to calm down.  It wasn\'t working to well, and I got to the point where I had to get S to tell me he felt a normal pulse.  After this I finally started calming down a little bit.  I use to always tell myself if what I eat to trip doesn\'t kill me in twenty minutes, I\'m going to be fine.  But I was so out of it, those thoughts of death started snowballing out of control and I couldn\'t deal with it.   I had myself convinced for a minute that I was about to fall over and die.  I didn\'t run around screaming or freak out or anything, I just had to be calmed down a little.  Once I got past this, I got back to just tripping.  T+2:45 After I settled down a little bit, I started enjoying the trip these seeds were giving me.  It\'s the closest thing to real acid I\'ve had without actually being on acid.  Taking whippits had become better than sex.  The feeling is really indescribable; just complete euphoria.  I\'m going to test this out by taking a big fatty balloon in the middle of the next time I\'m fucking a bitch.  If I don\'t try and stop her when she gets up and leaves after I get done with the balloon, then my hypothesis will be proven right.   T+3:30 The music had been turned off by now, and we had started watching family guy.  It\'s around this time I started noticing how tired I was getting.  My body had become completely fatigued, even though my mind was still jacked up.  I guess that\'s the major difference between these seeds and LSD.  LSD, for me at least, acts as both a psychological and physical amphetamine.  I just never run out of energy while on it.  I\'ve been able to go for eighteen hours without even feeling tired.  I can totally see myself dosing up and being able to run the Boston Marathon, at least if I knew there was more acid at the end to eat.  But these seeds were making me crash hard.  I could barely stand up and support myself.  When I tried to walk I could feel myself falling in one direction and I\'d have to catch myself.  I was also starting to get extremely paranoid.  The paranoia was so extreme I don\'t even remember what I was getting so paranoid about now, but I know it was just to out there to be real.  I kept it to myself and didn\'t let it wig me out or anything, it\'s just that I don\'t get paranoid that often anymore.  All the acid lore I\'ve ever read has said that vitamin C is the best thing to help combat the paranoia, so I tried eating a tangerine, but halfway through peeling it I lost interest in it and put it down.  I found it rotten the next morning.  I like grapefruits better anyway.      T+5:00 We had just finished watching The Simpsons and I was getting bored of watching the TV, and I was feeling tired as shit, so I went up to my room to lay down for a little bit.  I put on Dark Side of the Moon and just zoned out.  I turned on the I-tunes visualizer and just laid back and enjoyed the show.  When I made the effort not to let my self focus on any one object, the visualiser seemed to grow slowly till it took over the width of my room.  It was during this time I had shit ton of introspection.  None of it would matter to anyone but me, but it just reaffirmed a lot of things I had been feeling about everything that\'s been going on, and kind of gave me the lasting motivation I needed to get through it.  There\'s something weird about tripping that happens to me least.    While Im tripping there\'s some things that just all of sudden make complete sense, like the meaning of life, why we\'re here and things like that, but after the trip is over I can\'t remember why it made so much sense.  Then there\'s the realizations that stay with me a lifetime.  I don\'t think I really discovered myself until I tripped for the first time.  That\'s not to say I can\'t ever know myself without tripping, I think for me it just speeded up the process.  They can be a powerful tool for self exploration, but they can also be cruel and unforgiving.  I didn\'t have real, good, mind-blowing trips till I was comfortable with myself and my mind.  That\'s what I mean when I said this trip is going to be a lasting motivation to get through this situation.  Anyway, I realized no matter how shitty things may become I know at least there\'s always my own mind to keep me entertained.  That, and HB Woodrose.  T+5:45 Dark Side of the Moon ended, and suddenly I felt rejuvenated.  I went back downstairs and chilled again.  Eventually, Animals was put on.  It would seem like I would get tired of listening to it, seeing as how I just heard the whole thing tripping just a week ago and a few times in between, but every time I\'ve heard it, there is something different about it.  It\'s probably all in my head, but I think it\'s the greatest guitar work Pink Floyd ever accomplished.  Anyone accomplished for that matter.   T+7:00 By now I could barely keep my eyes open.  I was still tripping hard as hell, but my body was just to tired to go on.  I think it was more from the weed I smoked for the first time in a while then the seeds themselves.  I was having a good time, but I was so physically tired I couldn\'t even laugh.  I tried, but I just couldn\'t.  I said peace to D and S and went upstairs to try and pass out.  I remember laying down and turning the TV on with the sound off to try and help me get to sleep.  This ended up being a mistake.  I don\'t know what channel it was, but it was some guy dressed in a tuxedo riding around on roller skates, skating under people\'s tables in a theater.  Seriously, what the fuck.  T+12:00 The TV was to much for me to handle so I just turned it off and laid down.  I don\'t remember exactly falling asleep but I remember having some ridiculously vivid dreams.  One I would consider a nightmare actually.  I dreamed my grandmother showed up while the house was trashed and I just got done smoking weed.  It was weird though, she didn\'t even seem that mad about it, all she said to me was that she heard I\'d been doing ether.  When I denied it, she called me a liar and said she saw it on ESPN.  I don\'t know.  Anyway, I woke up still tripping.  My mind was back to normal for the most part, but I was still having some pretty strong visuals.  My whole room was swirling when I came too.  My body still ached pretty bad.  All I could think to myself was \'Oh, shit, I have a lab in a little while\'.  I knew I was in for a difficult experience.  T+13:00 I had woken up a few hours before my first class, so I chilled and listened to music.  I had to finish writing my lab report that was due during the lab which I found surprisingly easy.  The answers were coming to me easily, until I realized I had just been copying the instructors sample lab report and not my own so I had to start it all over.  It ended up not being all that bad, but I\'m sure I fucked it up in some way.  T+15:00 I was sitting in Rec. Management by now.  This class is not a good class for tripping.  The teacher is an old man that\'s absolutely ridiculous.  Everything he said was the funniest thing I\'d ever heard, even though I was the only laughing and he kept looking at me.  \'hey! Do you know how many people live in Alaska?  Hey! I went there when I was a kid your age! Hey you like the movie remember the titans?  I swear to god he said this.  Exactly like that.  Verbatim.  T+16:30 It was time for my lab.  I kind of just forced myself to get through this.  The only problem I had was every time the instructor said \'acid\' I wanted to say something stupid about eating it or snicker to myself because I\'ve eaten acid.  I had a lab partner who I think I freaked out a little by the way I was acting, but by the end of the lab I was talking to him about different acid movies and tripping.   Overall, it was pretty good lab.  T+18:00 I made it back to my house in one piece and ate a watermelon.  I had bought some grapefruits but the watermelon did me nicely.  I then slept for fifteen hours.  I think I\'ve found my new trip of choice, at least for a little while.  It\'s readily available, so I\'m going to start stockpiling this shit in case they make it illegal.  It gave me everything I love about tripping: ridiculous visuals, mental clarity and insight, and a bearable, yet intense body buzz.  The only downside to these seeds I could see is the fatigue they cause.  The vomiting wasn\'t very fun either, but in the end completely worth it.    But then again, I\'m going to have to eat them without smoking weed to see if that\'s what maybe actually caused the fatigue.  I\'m sure I will be eating them again soon.   They gave me the kind of trip that afterwards, food just tastes better, colors are brighter, being outside in the fresh air is amazing, and a renewed vigor for living.  It started off a little wierd, but now I know what to expect and will definitely not wig out again."
54450,Nocturnal Torment In an Alien Forest,Vastness,"Jul 23, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"[Erowid Note:  The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid\'s \'heavy\' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    A few days before, I powdered in a coffee grinder 4 doses of 25 of the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I had ordered from an online vendor. They were from Hawaii, allegedly with a very high germination rate and, according to several other sources, very potent.     Since I and my friends I would be tripping with had already done 800 seeds of morning glory as a first time dose, I assumed 24 seeds would be an equal dose. I was confused, however, by the fact that a website put the potency of HBWR at 25x that of morning glory, which would put our dose at 32 seeds. Since, however, we would be tripping in a tent in the forest instead of a house this time, we decided to go with a slightly lower dose, and I decided that rounding 24 to 25 would probably be a slightly weaker trip than before.    I woke up at around 10:30, went to school for my final A level exam that day, then met one of the 3 close friends I would be tripping with (lets call him J) after school. We picked up a quarter of \x91green (cannabis), bought some food (four chocolate yogurts, bourbons, crisps, cookies and apple juice) and stopped to smoke a joint on the way to meet M and R, who would be setting up a tent in the spot M and J had picked earlier. J apparently found it slightly more difficult to find the spot due to the effects of the joint, but we found it quite quickly anyway. On the way to it, I was told we didnt have a light, which worried me a bit since we would be tripping in absolute blackness, but I wasnt TOO worried, surprisingly. M looked disapproving and I thought I heard him say something like You look SO stoned, to us, but I could have imagined that.    I think before we put the tent up, J and M, in that order, took a few bong hits of the 40x salvia extract R had bought with him. We didnt have a torch lighter, though, so probably werent smoking it too efficiently. They both reported a feeling of something leaning into them (which was interesting, because Ive read of this being a common effect, although I never experienced it personally), and then decided it wasnt very good really and wasnt worth doing again, which is a shame really because I dont think either of them experienced anywhere near what salvia is actually capable of. Im sure Ill convince them to do it again anyway, though. It was while we were sitting out here that I realised I had absolutely NOT considered, AT ALL, bringing more clothes for the night. I was wearing jeans, a thin t-shirt, and a jacket, so it could have been worse, but I could have been warmer, all the same. R, however, had left the jeans he bought at Ms house, only having a jumper, calf-length shorts of some kind, and a thin blanket.    Finally we put the tent up, while listening to music (portable speakers attached to an mp3 player) which was more difficult than it needed to be because there were some poles missing, which meant the tent needed to be tied to some trees on either side of the path to hold it up. The tent was VAST, though. Seriously huge. I had imagined it would just about have sitting room for four people, but nowhere near what it actually had. There was an outside porch section which could be closed up, and then an inner room completely closed off with zips from even the other inner part of the tent, with 2 side compartments itself, which could be closed off or opened up. There was standing room for all of us, easily. I admit I actually didnt do too much to help setting up the tent myself, because I was still quite stoned, which always makes me feel pretty exhausted. I did what I could, though, and soon enough we all moved inside the front section of the tent. I was initially bothered by all the bugs that had got into the corners of the roof, but quickly forgot about them.    I got out the ground up seeds, which I had packaged neatly into bags, and those who hadnt seen it yet were pleased by the small amount compared to the bagful of morning glory we had to ingest before. We had been going to use the yoghurts, but they were hard to drink and we decided just to bomb it (wrap it in rizla and swallow) in one (or two, as some did). R put some in his yoghurt before realising he didnt like the taste, and then had to split it into bombs, which was pretty inconvenient for him. We washed down the bombs with apple juice, despite the fact that we had 2 big bottles of tap water, as I had read the fluorine (in the UK) in tap water destroys the lysergic alkaloids. R didnt seem to believe this (and I might have been wrong) but was still slightly uncertain about drinking the water for a while.    We smoked some joints on the comeup (and more were rolled for later, given how impossible we knew it would become), which, I expect, helped the initial nausea quite a lot. Coming up just sitting around the front of the tent was far easier than wandering around as we had done before, although R, it appeared, soon began to feel quite sick anyway. M and J threw away their yoghurts at his request, and also because they werent very good after all, but since I still felt OK I simply moved mine behind me out of his sight, since he was lying down with his eyes covered anyway. I soon moved and knocked it over, though, so I threw it away when he asked again and mopped up the spilt yoghurt with some sort of teacloth, which I then threw outside the tent with it.    Suddenly J began to feel nauseous as well, and went to throw up. R, maybe feeling slightly better now, went with him. I think everyone then went back inside the tent for a while, while I sat at the edge of it needing to throw up as well. It wasnt TOO bad at this stage, though. The mental trip was starting, and while I felt very sick, lying with my head outside the tent was comfortable enough and as long as I didnt move, I felt quite good. M was outside the tent for some reason, either throwing up or just lying there, and eventually J came out, munching on some crisps. I rolled over, satisfied that I probably wouldnt throw up now, and began to stare into the leaves. This was seriously AMAZING, and was when the trip truly began to start. I told M to look at the leaves, and I think J did as well after a while. R, I think, was still feeling sick (or just confused) inside the tent.    I cant really describe what the leaves looked like, but Ill try anyway  firstly, they were oak leaves, I think, and they started to take on the shape of tessellating clubs, as in a deck of cards. They also arranged themselves in what appeared to be almost an infinite tunnel of leaves, meaning the treetops looked a lot higher than they probably were. The circular parts of the clubs flashed green yellow colours, and faded in and out of being in a geometric grid that superimposed itself over the patterns of the leaves. The leaves looked like they were arranged far too geometrically in any case.    Looking at the tree trunks was also interesting  the spaces between the trees began to take on a newly three-dimensional appearance, whereas the tree trunks themselves looked like cardboard cut-outs, with a slight luminance about them. When I looked at the tree trunks closer to the tops of the trees, however, it looked as if the trees were grouped in small clusters, which all reached out to a single uniform, circular mat of flat leafy, branchy material at the top of the group. Each group swayed as one, while distinctly from the other groups. I began to realise how much they looked like alien mushrooms, and immediately the tree trunks began to look like veins in the skin of huge, invisible mushrooms, with the circular mats of leaf being the caps. The sky took on an alien colour as well, as if the composition of the atmosphere had changed, and I began to think of what an amazing variety of experiences there could be in self awareness, the realisations I gained staying with me even now.    In sober life, it appears, humans are extremely condescending towards what I can only describe, even now, as lesser forms of sentience  animal life. While we acknowledge, usually, the struggle of their existence, we always bear in mind HOW MUCH LESS they can feel (or so we think) than us. How much less intensely they feel emotions, and enjoyment and fear. For, surely, they have such simple brains! Im not condemning this  in fact, I dont think there is a practical alternative viewpoint to have, much as we cannot bear in mind the utter complexity of the universe lest we lose focus on our lives entirely. We have been designed evolutionarily to play a part, and attempting to circumvent our built in safeguards (such as the ability to necessarily ignore huge aspects of the existence we dwell in) will negate our importance in the human game. But I digress  it appeared to me, and does still, now, to some extent, that the processes occurring in my brain could not have been THAT complicated. Granted, LSD acts on a vast variety of receptors, Im not sure how other assorted lysergamides compare, but it seemed to me that was only a function of my brain density. IE, how much brain matter I have as a human.    At the same time, it seemed like my fascination with the invisible mushroom forest I seemed to have found myself in was taking up a very small part of my entire field of self-awareness. And surely, I realised  an animal with a brain equally saturated with chemicals (even if it WAS smaller)  could feel with just as much intensity as I was now. I reeled at the implications  another creature could live its entire life in a similar state to this, if it suited it, interacting with its world under a completely different set of base assumptions. I wondered how many arbitrary concepts had worked their way into the human communication game. How much more real were ideas such as forest to group areas of trees as mushroom clump to group groups of trees in the forest? While this is an extreme example which Im not entirely sure I believe now, I remain convinced there may be less obvious examples that are so intrinsic to our daily life that they remain unnoticed.     J had talked before this trip of how some sort of deep-ocean fish might simply be tripping all the time, if we could experience its mindset, so my memory of this probably influenced my realisations significantly. I imagined, as well, that we were at the bottom of a vast sea, at the bottom of a coral reef of some sort, the appearance of which the forest was quickly taking on. Experiencing the life of a species in a far vaster alien ecosystem, or the clumsily translated perceptions of one in our own? I was lost in a maze of thoughts of perception and self-awareness.    All through this, note, I had been rambling quickly and probably quite clumsily as I tried to convey my thoughts and experiences to my friends  I do this a lot on mushrooms, also. I was occasionally amused at my rapid talking about sometimes exceedingly abstract concepts, and would stop to ask if anyone understood me. Sometimes they said no, but surprisingly often the answer was yes, which I was pleased about. I talked a lot here, something not that usual for me. We also talked about how immense the coming night was going to be, and how much our situation would change in the coming years. This was somewhat saddening, but we had a whole night of insanity ahead of us for the moment.    R, finally, came outside the tent. I had come out of my very mental trip (although I had been conveying it by talking almost the whole time), and was leaning against the fabric of the inner room of the tent. We realised we all felt quite out of breath, but it wasnt at all uncomfortable. However, R mentioned breathing in some context, and J, it seemed, got quite worried suddenly about his own. He then apparently kept passing out for short periods, which I dont really remember, but I was tripping quite hard so I dont doubt it. My memory is a bit fragmented at this point also, so I have a few memories of everyone sitting outside the tent in different positions. I think M might have felt sick for a while here, as he was still lying in a way that made me think he was, but I might be wrong.    Everyone then began to move into the inner room of the tent, perhaps because it was becoming darker and colder outside, and also because we were beginning to trip quite hard. I remember, at this point, I was beginning to feel quite uncomfortable. The nausea was back a bit, and I was rapidly losing track of where I was and what position I was in. This happened near the end of the morning glory trip, but it was coming on extremely early this time. I remember someone asking M how he was, and him saying he wasnt sure if he felt OK, and, suddenly, everyone moved inside. There was such a huge amount of stuff outside the tent, though, which concerned me a lot  green, rizla, peoples rolling tobacco, CD players, speakers, CD cases, bags, jumpers, food, phones. None of us had considered it earlier, and while I could probably have just gone inside the tent and left it and no-one would have objected, I realised how much more intense the trip might get and decided it would be best to start getting everything inside before it was dark and we were all utterly incapable.     As well as this, I would be comforted by the fact that everything of any importance was safely in what I was thinking of, for the moment, as the inner sanctum of the tent. I first started selecting peoples things individually, and reaching in to hand them to them, but either this took me fucking ages or it got quite a bit darker quite quickly, or the trip just picked up speed as I was going (probably more likely) because I was soon more fucking confused than I have ever been about where the fuck I was, feeling like I needed to throw up continuously, all the while still frantically clinging to the thought that I just HAD to get ALL THIS SHIT inside the fucking tent! I think R may have offered to help me a few times, maybe the others did too, or maybe they were tripping too hard, but I still felt I could get this done and the task of doing it was an affirmation to myself that I was still slightly controlled.     Also, not out of any particular distrust at other peoples ability to do it properly, I just felt like it would be more satisfying to do it all myself. Thinking of it now, though, I wonder how much more confusing it would have been with someone else helping me.    I was also still able to enjoy myself a bit, despite the onrushing nausea and confusion, knowing the reward would be to sit in the comfortable warmth (I wished) of the inner room of the tent having got everyones shit safely inside. I had by now begun dumping random objects and loose papers and everything I could find just inside the door, but it took me a while every time to find even this. Note also that at this time I had absolutely no idea what sort of lighting there was outside and was almost scared to even step outside the boundaries of the tents floor mat in case I got lost and couldnt find my way back in, even though there was presumably enough light to see by. I kept repeating Where the fuck am I? I dont know where I am. I cant work out where the fuck I am. All the while stumbling around, occasionally chancing on some random item and getting it inside like I was triumphantly slamming a ball between goalposts (not physically, because some of this stuff was quite fragile, but in retrospect this was the sort of feeling of achievement I had).     I heard my friends being slightly amused by my stumbling around, and was amused in some part of my mind myself, still, despite my utter bewilderment and sickness. FINALLY, in any case, I had everything inside the doorway to the tents inner room (except the bottles of water, which might have spilt  or maybe someone moved them outside later), and clumsily lumbered inside, muttering to everyone exasperatedly how they would just have to hunt through the pile of shit in the entrance for whatever they needed, and lay down on the floor.    At this point it was getting so dark it was basically impossible to see. I had NO IDEA where I was inside the tent. I wasnt even sure I was inside the tent sometimes. The proportions of it stretched and contorted in the blackness, once taking on the shape of a circus tent, and I actually thought there was a large cage like object sitting some distance away from me, although I never stopped to properly think about this. Light sprinklings of colours spiralled in the darkness making imaginary patterns, and I occasionally grabbed random things before putting them down, utterly ignorant as to what I had just been holding. I kept looking up, wondering what was going on, lying back down again, and listening to people talk. I heard someone (maybe M) say they werent sure if theyd be able to move if they needed to throw up and someone else (maybe J) reply that they knew and just to move away from the centre. In the dark, actually, the tent seemed far bigger than it was. I felt like I was lying with everyone in different parts of a small circus tent.     If it was lighter and I had realised that it wasnt actually THAT big I would probably have felt a lot more secure. But then, I might have thought it was big because I felt cold, which was probably because the door of the inside of the tent was open, and all the outside doors were open, and exposed to the night.    The ground was SO UNCOMFORTABLE, also. I just cant express how astonishingly uncomfortable the ground was. Sticks and pieces of rock jutted into my sides and my back no matter which way I lay, and I just couldnt get comfortable. Comfort soon stopped being the priority, though, and it became instead making sure not to stay in one position long enough for any limbs to fall asleep. I dont think there was music, but there was some sort of insane tune in my head, and it felt like I was moving up and down where I was lying in time to it, like the ground was made of (hard) rubber. It wasnt at all comfortable, though, because lying over it all was the feeling of intense discomfort that the sensory psychedelia did absolutely zero to negate. I soon realised I wasnt sure I could even breathe, and kept suddenly taking great gasps of air. I immediately wished I hadnt smoked any joints earlier, believing the lingering burntness of my respiratory tract to be making the situation worse.     I actually think I was breathing, now, since I can breathe quite easily with barely perceptible inflation of my chest, but at the time the fact I couldnt feel my breathing was fucking terrifying, and of course the panic this caused only made things worse. I thought I heard M say something like I cant\x85 breathe, properly\x85, or maybe it was someone else, but in any case it was a sentiment I shared. I was actually wondering, for a while, what the fuck we could do. I was imagining a huge variety of different scenarios of just being found by the police, or leaving fucking everything and stumbling to someones house, even though I realised how absolutely we could just not do this and how much we would regret it if we even tried.    I also thought a lot about my family situation, something I was led onto to some extent by the fact that I thought briefly about how absolutely we could not go back to my house  it was seriously horrible. I dont even like to think about the sensation of it now, although, of course, I cant really envision how I was thinking at the time. I was just thinking, mainly, about how different I seemed from my family, and how incomplete my relationship with them was in general. I regretted not being closer to them, but at the same time I really didnt think I needed to change in a manner that would improve my relationship with them.     I absolutely had no idea what I could do to solve it, which just caused me to mentally despair, but now, Im going to blame it (and I dont think this is a cop-out) on the way our society is structured. Family groups are so absolutely different from how they were as we evolved, and it is an evolutionary patchwork that allows us generally to ignore this fact. While this may be sufficient for a normally functioning brain, a brain in the midst of an abnormal chain reaction sparked by one of natures most powerful psychoactives is too laden with hidden passages and alternative routes of thought for this rudimentary barrier to do anything to protect us. Hopefully, in any case, Ill eventually find a way to resolve this situation to my satisfaction.    It was also so impossible to move. Absolutely insurmountable lethargy. But, once again, it was just necessary to force myself to change my position every now and again, even though the new position would be no better  in retrospect maybe it did help a bit, but at the time I was always moving on the hope of a minor abatement of discomfort, and keeping my aching limbs awake. The former hope I never felt was satisfied at the time. I was very worried I would just pass out in a weird position on the uncomfortable ground, and wake up with certain parts of my body having died from lack of blood flow.    J was talking occasionally, but I wasnt sure what he was saying. I heard the words, but I could not expend any mental energy on grasping the concepts, since it was all focused on just enduring. I would occasionally grunt, and I think M did more than me. I maybe talked once or twice  mainly just to state that I realised rationally that I just needed to endure it, but at the same time the internal psychoemotional torment would just not relent. I could barely think most of the time, except to say how bad I felt. Some time in this eternity of torment, R came back in, apparently having gone outside to throw up. There was some sort of light, Im not sure if it was from a torch or just a lighter, but he was standing up and saying he could get things for people because he now felt so much better. I think I might have asked for some water, but Im not completely sure.    I think I lay for longer while I vaguely listened to R and J talk for a while  one of them (I think R) said that the seed husks were probably what caused the nausea, and I had neglected to remove them because I had read it was a myth. Having experienced such an overwhelmingly bad feeling, however, Ive since found myself reconsidering many of the supposed myths about these seeds  the husks contain most of the nausea causing chemicals, the seeds themselves contain cyanogenic glucosides, etc, etc. As far as I can tell, theres no hard evidence either way, and those that are sceptical of such claims may just be more tolerant to the aforementioned chemicals than others. The way I felt sounds very similar to cyanide poisoning, some symptoms of which being, off the top of my head, extreme lethargy, bluing of the limbs (my fingers hurt to move at times, at least) and extreme sickness.    Shortly after this, though, there was a light outside my closed eyelids, and J was sitting up with a surprisingly bright torch  we had a light after all! Perhaps it was the same one that had illuminated R earlier, perhaps not. The light briefly washed away my utter internal lack of control, and for a few precious seconds I forgot how uncomfortable I felt. M had just gone outside to throw up, and J told me to do the same. I had, truthfully, felt like I was going to throw up for so long, but could do nothing about it. I have no idea at what stage in the trip I was in at this point, but I clumsily stumbled outside.    I stood there for ages at the front entrance of the tent, holding alternately onto one of the supporting poles of the tent, and one of the trees we had tied to the tent with a rope to support it. I worked this out by feeling alone, since it was utterly black. There was presumably some starlight, however, as I could tell there was a crumpled carrier bag lying directly in front of the tent. These landmarks, anyway, and stumbling between them and using them to orientate myself (note that none of them were anything more than a meter from each other, probably less) would make up the next few hours. I stood there for so long, dry heaving at the ground. Just needing to throw up. I needed to throw up so much it was unbearable. I said I just NEED to throw up! in an almost panicked tone so many times. I felt I was just about to throw up for so long, leaning against that tree or grasping at that pole. Finally I heard M throwing up and he went back inside.     Apparently he hadnt actually thrown up and had just given up, though, which I didnt find out until later. Still, at the time, his going back inside worried me so much, since it seemed to me I was being sick for abnormally long. I had been the last one to throw up on morning glory as well, so this shouldnt have surprised me, but the nausea was SO bad. I bent over for ages, attempting to compress my stomach and force out its contents, to no avail, and then simply kneeled, dry heaving and spitting at the ground. My worry over my breathing came and went, but Im positive it was with me for the rest of the night. I cant express well how much discomfort I was in, in writing, and cant even, really, imagine it now, but know that it was in that night that I felt the worst I have ever felt in my life. The badness I felt absolutely cannot be conceived from within a normally functioning mind.    The next few hours were utter freezing torment. I would kneel on the ground, keel over, sit up suddenly, worrying Id got vomit or saliva on my hair, run my fingers through it, get dust from the forest floor over my face and on my lips, try to get a piece of dirt off my overwhelming dry tongue, and stand up, kneel, heave, repeat. At some point when I was sitting I realised I had taken my shoes off earlier, and apparently neglected to bring them in when I had embarked on my mission to get everything else inside. This worried me a lot. I worried I might have pissed on them or thrown up on them or that they might just be in the forest and lost. I reached out  and found a shoe! For a moment I was completely overjoyed, and it is odd to consider, in retrospect, that I could experience such enjoyment in the midst of such agony, even if it was at such a small mercy at a found shoe. I said how happy I was to anyone who was listening inside the tent, tried to put my shoe on, found it didnt fit, asked and wondered if anyone else had left their shoes outside, and left it again.     I then realised I might have been trying to put it on the wrong foot. Suddenly I was hit by a new wave of nausea, stood up, and threw up forcefully. For a few moments I felt so utterly relieved. Then the nausea was back. I was utterly devastasted at the fact that I still had NOT FINISHED throwing up! I decided to try the shoe again, grabbed it, and it fit my foot. I grasped around in the dark and found the other, and put it on. I was so happy, on top of the nausea, for the simple mercy of having been allowed to put shoes on.    I stuck my fingers deep down my throat, feeling my contracting tonsils and root of my tongue, and spewed acid from my throat. I immediately felt a pain in the root of my front teeth from the scorching biogenic chemical I had just brought up. I did this several times, then simply could NOT throw up anymore, even though I still felt like I needed to! I used my finger to force my stomach to contract completely, stomach walls meeting each other (at least, it felt like this), but nothing came out. I grabbed for the water bottle, knocked it over, picked it up, drank some water, sloshed it about in my mouth, spat it out, drank some more. I had done this several times when I was trying to throw up also.    This was probably where the trip got the worst. I just could not stop imagining how bad things could be. All the horrors over the short reign of humankind (and even those without) flashed through my mind. Theres really not much I can write about this, since the essence of it is fairly inconceivable, but I dont think there wasnt a potential horror I didnt consider, or a bad light in which I didnt look at my life. I became overwhelmingly depressed about how bad things WERE, and was further depressed by how much worse they could be. Was there no end to badness that could be felt?    I then realised, much to my dismay, that I needed a piss. I stood up, stumbled around in my confusion, reached down to feel the boundary of the tent floor mat (I had to do this several times as well, in addition to feeling for the tree, the pole, or looking at the white plastic bag in the faint starlight). And immediately staggered back, worried I was standing in my vomit. I knelt down inside the tent, and stupidly announced I needed a piss and asked for suggestions. I received the obvious (Get your cock out, and piss.) with a warning that seemed like an afterthought not to piss on the tent. I stumbled back into the porch of the tent, knocked over another water bottle fucking everywhere (how many fucking bottles were there in this tent?!) and stumbled out of one of the side entrances of the porch. I then pissed a lot, worrying I might start to throw up while I was pissing. I went back inside the tent porch, resumed my position attempting to throw up, and then found, much to my utter dismay, again, that I needed a piss again but this time just couldnt piss. I physically couldnt force the urine from my bladder. It may have been, in fact, that I actually didnt need to piss after all and it was simply very cold, and in retrospect this seems very likely given that I had just pissed a lot. But I couldnt risk this. I knelt on the ground to throw up some more occasionally, as well, while complaining how I couldnt piss. I tried so hard to piss I thought I might shit myself, which may have been more possible than usual because of the havoc the seeds were still playing with my digestive tract.    I once stumbled back inside the tent, stupidly asked if I could come in, then just told everyone I still needed to piss and throw up and went back outside, knowing how pointless it was to go in, in the first place. I resumed my routine of kneeling, standing, and just moving so that none of my limbs would fall asleep, and found it so difficult to breathe properly. I listened to J and R talking inside the tent and became very paranoid at points. There was really no reason for me to be paranoid, although its possible that at times they may actually have been talking about my condition, because theyre both extremely good friends, but I was feeling so unhappy and uncomfortable and overwhelmingly despairing that I couldnt help looking at every situation in the worst light I could. Its worth bringing up here that throughout this trip I wasnt sure if I would ever come down  I thought about the famous LSD flashbacks, post-traumatic stress disorder, and wondered if I would ever, really, be happy again.    FINALLY, anyway, I managed to piss. Not very much at all, but enough to say fuck it and go back inside. I washed my hands first quite thoroughly with some water (more for the benefit of those in the tent, given how long I had stood just holding my penis in the dark  probably half an hour at least  all the while ranting about how unhappy I was about the fact that I just couldnt piss although I needed to). Earlier on I had been asked by people inside the tent if I was masturbating  apparently they thought I might try this, since I had wondered if I just needed to warm up my genitals enough to be able to piss. Another thing  throughout the night, my testicles felt so uncomfortably tight. R later brought this up, apparently having experienced this as well.     As I stumbled inside I knocked over a water bottle again, righted it, now used to such an occurrence, and lay down next to everyone else, who was under a sheet. Lying down felt amazing for a moment. I had stood in the dark for so long that lying down, even on such hard, uncomfortable ground, was so relieving. I still needed to throw up, but by now I just decided that if I couldnt throw up I might as well fight in the opposite direction and suppress the urge. It seemed to be coming in waves now, anyway. Another problem remained, though  I was seriously SO COLD. Unbearably. J had told me several times earlier that there was another jumper in his bag, but I maintained I was completely unable to get it, and finally someone threw a jumper at me (I assume it was the one in Js bag) to which I simply responded Ahhh, man, I cant express\x85 as I draped it over me. There was no way I could work out how to put it on.    I still felt nauseous and uncomfortable and found it hard to breathe. I kept waking myself up suddenly with great gasping breaths. I said I needed to throw up again several times, and said maybe I would just throw up in my bag. I was told (I think by R) that there was a plastic bag next to me, and I reached over to it, clumsily pushed it to my face, and threw up burning liquid which I quickly inhaled and spluttered out, my throat and lungs rasping at the effort. During throwing up, I thought I felt vomit running down my side, and was quite sure that in my haste to throw up, I had thrown up onto the bottom of the bag or something, and it had all trickled out. I was incredibly relieved, then, to feel the comforting feeling of a full and warm plastic bag. I suddenly realised I felt SO MUCH BETTER. SO MUCH. SUCH a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I said this a lot, apparently in a much more high-pitched voice than usual. J and M were mostly asleep by this point, but J mumbled that was what he had been talking about earlier. R asked me to pass something to him (a tin, I think, and cigarettes) and finding them was so enjoyable.     It was still quite dark by this point, but I was so overwhelmingly happy. The ground didnt even feel so uncomfortable anymore. J needed to throw up suddenly, and I gave him the plastic bag, but I dont think he did. He then went outside, M with him, and I found out later that they both threw up at this point, marking the first time M had thrown up at all. At this point, despite the remaining cold, I felt so good I decided to try to put on the jumper I had been given earlier on. I finally gave it to R to sort out while I took off my jacket, and then I put it on and the jacket over it, once again saying how much I cant express (\x85my gratitude  being the implication). Someone who had been outside had also closed up the entire outside porch of the tent and zipped up the inner door as they came back in. The room was pleasingly enclosed when everyone was back inside. I went outside to find the mostly spilt water bottles later in the morning, and took them inside (along with a lighter I found with them), closing everything again as I went.    I then sat up for ages with R talking about the night before. I think, in retrospect, I was acting quite weirdly in the way I spoke. Slightly like I was pilled, but also just generally strangely. It was enjoyable, though. It seemed our trips had been quite similar in the overall fact that they had just been such a terrible night, but we both shared the utterly strange feeling of what a good experience it had been at the same time, and how glad we were it had happened. While I was talking I noticed I was still very confused, though, and at times it felt like I was forgetting what I was trying to say in the process of saying it, relying on my memory only of what the next few words were going to be, and utterly forgetting whatever I had been saying by the time I had finally said it.    I began to eat, and while biting hurt my teeth because of their earlier acid bath, the flavour was too good to pay attention to this. I actually managed to eat basically all the crisps, which I felt a bit bad about later. Some cookies, also, and a few bourbons. We may have smoked a joint at this point, but Im not 100% sure of this. There were some dog walkers, and a few dogs barked at the tent and seemed to sniff around it, but fortunately the outside was closed.    M went out later on briefly, I think to piss, and we heard some guy talk to him briefly, saying something like Could you not do this somewhere else?! Youre right across the path! Dont think youre even allowed. Apparently, M ignored him completely, which I find pretty funny. A spider landed on the roof (at least, what I thought was a spider) and neither R or I could work out whether it was moving or not, or what it was doing with its legs  it looked like it was whirling them around at some points, but when I focused inwards again, they became normal sized legs for a spider that size.    M woke up briefly, reached over J to the water lying on its side, drank some, and put it down upright next to J. I thought J would probably move and knock it over, but then thought that no, that probably wouldnt happen after all. Later on in the morning, J woke up and said hed knocked over the water. After everyone got up for a while, we all went and stood outside briefly, opened up the tent again, took some valuable stuff from the tent (but left a lot as well) and went out to the golf course with apple juice, water, bourbons, and green. It seemed everyone had had a bad trip besides J, oddly. We smoked quite a few joints and ate quite a few bourbons (finished them, in fact). Lots of golfers walked past us, and all said something about how we were going to get hit by a ball. Some guy on a ride-on lawnmower machine came and told us to move, and we walked for a bit. I realised that I just couldnt move, though. I seriously felt like I would pass out if I stood up for too long. I think everyone else probably felt similar, as we all sat down probably 10 meters from where we had been before. Some younger people came up on a converted car of some sort and told us to move again, and we just stumbled back into the forest and back inside the tent. Smoked more joints, tried to hotbox the inside of the tent, finished the green, talked about how good food would be. We had stayed in the tent for ages, really. It was almost 4 oclock PM by this point.    Suddenly, anyway, I decided I wanted to smoke some salvia. No-one seemed to want to do it with me, but I wasnt phased. I always find salvia fun in such a weird way, a feeling most people dont seem to share. The 40x was either all gone or lost, so I only had some packets of 6x. There was also no torch lighter, so I would just have to smoke as much as I could. There was no water, either, so taking a huge hit would be difficult. Despite this, I loaded the bong with 3 quarters of one of my bags of 6x salvia extract, lit it, and began to inhale. I took several hits, each time until I felt I might cough, and held them all for varying lengths of time. I did several things wrong, really, even with the lack of proper salvia smoking equipment. I didnt hold the lighter on the salvia for every hit, just let it burn, and I just didnt take enough hits or big enough hits in general.    Despite this, I got some interesting effects. I mainly noticed I was being affected when I noticed first some minor effects, and then tried to explain them and noticed how slurred and messy my voice sounded. J was moving around a lot, it seemed, while still sitting down, and when he moved his arms I realised what it looked like  it looked like peoples bodys were made up of a selection of blocklike pieces  much like they were Lego men, in fact, but perhaps with slightly more definition, like one of the many imitations of Lego people. M looked a bit more like a Duplo man, but it was very similar. It looked like people had the joints of toy men like this. The smoke gave the room a weird western feel, as well, and I felt like I was in a childrens cartoon, or a toy in a toybox. I feel this a lot on salvia, but often I feel more like a child in a toybox, or a playroom, whereas this time I was also a toy. I didnt look at R too much in this experience. But when his arm moved in the corner of my eye it looked like a wave on the surface of his blanket.    Although I felt everything Ive just described, the experience was in fact quite mild compared to some salvia trips Ive had. I noticed immediately how slurred my talking was, and how much it felt like something was leaning into my body, probably because I had been with people experiencing that yesterday  but, in this case, something was leaning into me, because I was lying into the fabric of the tent at an odd angle. I was disappointed to find the green was all gone, because the comedown from salvia feels very weird and not that enjoyable.    Finally we started to clear up the tent, picked up everything, packed it up, left the rubbish, and went home. I was so overwhelmingly exhausted, and my face looked so tired. I had some bread and butter and something that may have been a pear at Ms house, and then decided with R, perhaps stupidly, to buy the cheapest ticket we could get to get into the station so we would have some money for chips. There was someone at the gates at the other station, so we had to pay, after which we couldnt afford food.    I got a bus home, ate a pizza, an orange, and drank loads of some ultra fat content chocolate milk I was surprised to find in my fridge, then went to sleep, having eaten far too much too quickly and feeling extremely bloated.    Retrospectively:    Im surprisingly glad about this experience, and actually felt amazingly happy the next day for no apparent reason. Im so glad that night happened. I truly feel like its added an experience of great value to my life.    It is true, having experienced such an overwhelmingly bad trip, that I can appreciate how not that bad everyday life actually is a lot more. The fact that I survived it is also, to some extent, a testament to my own mental resilience, a lesson about my personal limits and a lesson in just how much a person can actually endure. Most people will never experience the sort of relentless hellish torment that powerful psychedelics can provide, and while I dont mean to deprecate physical suffering in any way, and am aware that the ability to inflict such an experience on oneself is itself an indicator of an abundance of physical comfort  psychological suffering is in some ways on a level completely distinct from that of physical sensation, something revealed quite obviously by the fact that so many would not even consider embarking upon a such a path, or touching a psychedelic. Having emerged from such an intensity of it unscathed (and, bear in mind, some people definitely would not) does feel unshakably like a triumph. I feel like Ive learnt a lot about myself.    I dont feel scared away from psychedelics at all, and, really, cant wait to trip again.    I do enjoy thinking about the insanity of the attempt, though. Taking 25 (!) of a strain of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds known to be extremely potent (despite numerous warnings not to take too many in an unfamiliar environment), in a tent, at night, in a forest. Haha, fuck."
51992,Abatement of Schizophrenia Symptoms,no1,"May 2, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"This report is an attempt to describe the beneficial effects of the drug LSA, and how I\'ve accidentally found it to be an effective way of temporarily banishing schizophrenia (in one case, up to a week). Not a pleasent way, but a way nevertheless.    It started when a friend/semi-roommate and I bought a large quanity of baby hawaiian woodrose seeds from a Hawaiian supplier. We decided to make a crude extraction, with (cleanly evaporating) camp fuel, and isopropyl alcohol. I won\'t go into that here, because this extraction is talked about in great detail elsewhere.    The first time I took it, it was to calibrate the dose. I had fun standing around in the desert, tripping, enjoying the music at a party I probably shouldn\'t have been at. Everyone was relaxed and nice to talk to though, and didn\'t care, so I didn\'t either. At a low dose it was euphoric, mildly visual.    But the time that its interaction with schizophrenia really became apparent was at a huge electronic music festival. People wandered around decked out in beads, funny pants, and other memorabilia from an unfortunately dead age. Some of the worlds best DJs were playing phat music, ripping through crowds of dancers. It started earlier in the day. I had 3 capsules of unextracted, ground, defatted seeds (~30-40 seeds?). In retrospect this was WAY too much for this kind of E-d out setting. But Infected Mushroom, the psitrance group, was proforming during the day, and I was DAMNED if I was going to see them sober. So I took the 3 capsules. My mind was unhinged within an hour. Far, far, too much. The music was amazing, and so was the nausea. Nausea with the seeds is much worse if I\'m feeling self-concious, or otherwise bad about something. In the huge crowd of people I became unhinged. I started to become very delusional. I was convinced that people were watching me, and that the crowd in general gave a shit about what I was doing. At the same time I was very calm, LSA relaxes me physically. Questions like \'where do I sit down\' became huge, 10 minutes of pondering type questions. Every mental disorder I had became blatantly obvious.     I heard people talking about how visibly crazy I was, but, it was probably a hallucination. I wandered after my friends, taking their cue for everything. Despite all this, I was enjoying myself. The music was wonderful, the dancing was great, and I found that my muscles had relaxed and for the first time in my life I could liquid (sorta). At one point I spent around an hour sitting in the grass looking at the trees, the ravers, everyone and everything.    What was interesting is when I started to come down. I was there with a friend and a roommate (who incidently had threatened to ditch me if I got too fucked up. Fortunetly they went back on this). What I started to notice coming down from this rather intense trip was that several things I had been convinced of in the preceding month just sort of melted away. I had been convinced that one of the two people I was with was planning on betraying me or screwing me over in some way. I don\'t remember how. As I came down, suddenly I started to have this feeling of clarity. I realized that no one was plotting against me. No one around me was watching me. All my paranoia and delusions kind of melted away, replaced by a sense of being clear headed. The auditory hallucinations (they usually sound like people in another apartment, or who are just out of sight - I do not suffer from visual hallucinations) disappeared, but I didn\'t notice, because - they weren\'t there. Suddenly all these things from the past month made sense in a calm, clear headed manner. I thought about this all while watching a huge metal flower belching flame.    Schizophrenia in many people, like me, comes and goes. This was during a peak of delusional thought. After the trip I was completely sane and non-delusional for around a week. For another 3-4 days I was better than usual. It was a relief. It wasn\'t like taking an antipsychotic, which only dims the hallucinations and delusions. With LSA they were simply gone.    In case anyone is immediately tempted to go try some - remember, I payed for it by being more crazy than usual for a short period of time. I have no idea whether this was idiosyncratic or not. And I took a very very high dose of LSA containing seeds. I was throwing up frequently. While I have since experienced this effect, I haven\'t had the nerve to take as much as I did at the electronic music festival. The constant nausea is a definite problem."
50528,Shallow Depth in Strange Dreaming,Mayakaya,"Apr 14, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"I am interested in psychedelics not so much for their ability to delight, but for their ability to open us beyond the usual limitations of everyday awareness and allow us entrance into and connection with what we might refer to as the Gaian Mind, the fabric of collective consciousness.  I became interested in LSA as a legal and readily available alternative to commonly known psychoactives.  My conclusions about its efficacy follow.  Each of these sessions was conducted alone.     ONE.  After removing the outer shells, I crushed five HBW seeds and steeped them in hot water for about 2 hours.  During this time I prepared self & space with a little meditation, reading, quiet reflection, and focus of intent.  At the time of ingestion, in the early evening, I had not eaten for at least six hours.  Shaking the seed-mixture in a sealed container yielded a cloudy gray-white tonic.  I drank the mixture, seed-bits and all, followed by a cup of hot herbal tea.      I soon felt the first flickers of psychoactivity, but within thirty-minutes my stomach was grinding itself into a cramped knot, lending to periodic waves of mild nausea.  I lay down, almost fetal, calmly observing the sensations.  After about a half-hour of fluctuating, immobilizing discomfort, I decided to eat a banana, and immediately began to feel better.  Well, yes.  Then I vomited.  But when I next looked in the mirror, I saw my pupils almost visibly dilating, saucer-wide and glittering a little, accompanied by a crookedish grin, suddenly surprised to find myself in the loopy first frames of psychedelic phase-shift.      The house was bright, mirage-like, and I was so relieved to be beyond sickness, so joy-buzzed and so hungry that I ate an immaculate bowl of honeyed cereal.  Feeling much better, I sat to welcome an intensifying trip, but none came, only minor shifts in uneven waves.  Hoping to potentiate the experience, I began to smoke shisha (arabic tobacco) from our hookah, which was lovely and leveling, but did little for the mildly unsettling trip, despite attempts to focus with music and intent.  Finally I gave up on this spiritual orientation, smoked a bowl, strapped headphones, and relaxed into mind set to circus  the LSA and cannabis definitely harmonized, though not to any exceptional degree.  The night ended tranquilly and I slept soundly.         TWO.  A year later, hoping for better results with the concentrated substance, I prepared an alcohol extraction, as described elsewhere on Erowid, with 20 seeds.  I took half of the resulting LSA-tincture as a shot on an empty stomach, and sat to meditate.  Again I soon noticed those first flickers, but within thirty-minutes felt flatly sick.  I patiently lay down for a half-hour, then abruptly got up and vomited.  I immediately felt fine, with no stoned or sick feeling to speak of, just a little looseness, slightly psychedelic, as if Id just had a few drinks. This sensation faded within the hour.  Finished with the experiment, I went for a walk.  The timing was fortuitous; I ran into a friend who urgently needed a place to stay, which I was able to provide, and what followed was an unusually synchronistic evening, suggesting that these substances/spirits sometimes work in strange ways\x85    THREE.  Two weeks later, the remaining alcohol tincture had completely evaporated, leaving a greenish residue that I rolled into a little pellet assumedly an LSA-pill.  I took it in the evening, not expecting much.  After a half-hour Id noticed no onset, but began to feel incredibly tired, and decided to cash in early.  I fell asleep quickly.  An hour later, when I woke up, I was tripping.    With increasingly awareness, I slowly emerged thru several dream-hallucinations.  I was the bed of a stream, each pebble, and could feel the water running over me, illuminating me with tactile colors\x85 I was the water, could feel the pebbled stream-bed as I flowed, as I melted continually yet never dissolved\x85 I was a thousand life-streams, or one life-stream, flowing through individual forms, and as I awoke I drifted through as many as twelve distinct persons; their faces were my face, their bodies, the shape of the world in their minds men, women, of different ages and ethnicities, different times\x85 I had trouble placing exactly who I was among them all, until I emerged into the lucidity of lying half-naked in the summers heat, and remembered the LSA Id taken.  Initially I panicked.  I still felt exhausted, and now disoriented, reacting, thinking: Im not ready for This! I cant do this Now! I dont have the energy to take this trip! Im not prepared!  But wisdom won me over as I acknowledged that this was the reality of the present moment and I was going to have to roll with it.  So I settled in for what became an absolute ordeal\x85    Though I was very careful in making the extract, it is clear that it was toxic as well as psychoactive.  I laid awake for most of the night, mildly tripping in a half-dream that resembled a fever-state because I felt so stomach-sick.  I drank water continually, but found it difficult to piss or vomit, though I wanted to.  My body seemed to be having trouble flushing the substance thru.  I felt that I was being challenged to observe the present moment with equanimity, and accepted this, reflecting on why I had subjected myself to such unnecessary suffering in an alleged attempt to alleviate suffering in the liberation of experiential understanding.  Though perhaps I did achieve some measure of that, after all.      Early in the morning I was finally able to drink some tea and sink into an uneasy sleep for a few hours, before I began the next day, ground-down and full of humility.    CONCLUSIONS.  What these three experiences reveal is that H.B.Woodrose is not an ally of mine.  It may be for others. This significantly diminishes the few positive aspects of the plants psychoactivity.  Perhaps further exploration will yield new means of potentiating LSA, but until then, I am convinced that it is largely a waste of effort.  As Terence McKenna has articulated, psilocybin mushrooms offer the safest, most effective psychoactive compound on the planet.    Most people never travel.  They simply transport the mad loop of their brain\'s thoughts from place to place.  To truly travel is to stand on fields of yourself where you have never stood before.  --Speed Levitch    Pleasure alone is merely a temporary indulgence, a subtle distraction, an anesthetization while on the path to something higher, deeper, lower.  Eternity lies beyond.   --Toni Bentley"
24294,The Ebb and Flow of the One,experience nature,"Mar 30, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"I have taken H.B. Woodrose seeds 2 times before, once just chewed up and eaten and another time crushed up and soaked in water for an hour before straining the seeds and drinking the mixture.  I always scrape off the fuzzy outer layer of the seeds before taking in order to reduce nausea.  Dramamine greatly reduces the amount of nausea if taken 30 or 45 minutes before the experience.  Here is my experience:    At around 4:30, I took the Dramamine at work.  After I got off work, I met up with my friend that I was taking the seeds with.  At around 5:15, we ate the seeds a few at a time, chewing them up as much as possible and swallowing them.  After that, we decided to go smoke some hydro to further reduce the nausea.  We left in my car and headed for the nearest recycling center to recycle some boxes.  As we arrived, I felt like I was going to throw up.  I held it in, and we loaded up the bowl to smoke.  At 5:45 we smoked the bowl and drove around for a while.  At approximately 6:30 or so, we arrived at this girls house where we were going to trip.  We went around back to this patio area where I found a comfortable place to lie on this pink pillow on my back as I waited for the trip to come on.      As I lay there, I began to feel a negative energy take me over.  I decided I needed to call another friend of ours so that he could come over.  I called him and the friend I was tripping with had to give him directions, because I was starting to feel become overcome by this negative energy.  After I talked to him, the negative energy grew exponentially in proportion.  Almost right when my friend got off the phone, I wanted to come down.  I told my friend to call the guy that was coming over back and tell him to bring me some milk.  At this point, I was so afraid that I would be left forever in this state that I was in, and everything seemed so negative and bad.  I really wanted to be with my girlfriend, but she was out of town, it seemed that she so far away that I felt as though I could never reach her. I held on to my friend as she comforted me.  She told me everything was going to be okay and that she had been in my position before. I sat up a couple of times and told myself out loud that I could be in control and that I could take control of my experience and be in control.  One of the final times I sat up, I finally gained control.  I proceeded to lay back down in my position on the pink pillow, and stare at the ceiling.      When the majority of the negative energies had subsided, I stretched my arms high into the air, with my fingers laced together and felt my body and my self in relation to the environment.  I began to take control of the experience that I was having and the environment around me.  At this same time, I was having an internal conversation with what seemed to be the negative experiential potential of the seeds.  I kept insisting that I was not going to channel negative energies through my experience, and the other voice kept making it known that we could exist in harmony with one another in the experience.  As the voice faded another voice began to speak, fading in and out.  Things began to move slower.  Although things were moving slower, I was in control of my body and experience, therefore, my body knew not to let things slow down to the point of death.     The voice seemed to come from both the environment around me and the environment within me.  It kept saying, You just have to keep\x85 I cannot recall what the faint voice was saying, but I understood it to be telling me I just have to hold on or I just have to be in control.  It was but a faint voice, calmly speaking to me.  It very well could have been my pineal gland opening up to expose me to new encounters and experiences.  My body became increasingly smaller in relation to the environment around me.  My friend next to me was talking to me, but I tuned her out.  Although I love my friend dearly, I felt almost as though interaction with her or any of my other friends would cause me to have a bad experience.  So I continued to withdraw from everything around me and focus on my self.    It felt as though the whole world was moving slowly in waves all around me, I would look up occasionally to see the breeze calmly swaying the trees and I was reminded of how much the world is in a constant ebb and flow.  The whole universe seemed to move in waves around me.  My legs were propped up in an A position and I was on my back, and I began to sway my legs back and forth with the flow of the environment around me.  As I swayed my legs, I would breathe in and out occasionally, and every time I breathed it would be to the same vibe of the universe both around me and within me.  At this time I became unaware of many things around me, such as time, friends, and even the space 3 feet in front of me. I think it was about 8:00 though.    As things in the world seemed to dissolve into trivial thoughts, the in-and-out fading of the waves of environment and my body seemed to disassociate my body from my inner being, or self.  A warmness overcame my inner being and I became detached from my body completely.  I could still move if I wanted to, but I lay on my side and let the harmonious euphoria of the waves induce my inner being into a pure and clear state of equilibrium with everything inside, outside, and beyond me.  I felt like the waves of the universe, all existing in harmony, were flowing with me as a part of them.  I had become one with the common ebb and flow of everything that exists in this world, whether it be living or immobile.      As people I believe that we create ourselves in a persona, or image, that we wish to be viewed by the whole world.  We develop around our clique of friends and environment specifically to our needs and wants based on our personal mask.  From these things we develop and understand what love is, what hate is, how to love, how to hate, how to survive and how to be at peace in our environment.  My experience with H.B. Woodrose seeds took me to the roots of all that we should know as humans - that universe around us is one - and in flows together in an ebb and flow through all of us.  Whether it is in relationships, technology or nature.  We all can flow together in euphonious harmony if we can reunite with the roots from which we all came - the unity of one.     I later became increasingly more aware of my surroundings, I heard everyone around me talking and recognized them all as my friends.  I felt waves of love for my friends come over me frequently, partly because I was so glad that they were there to contribute their thoughts and love to my experience (even though I had paid no attention, their web of thoughts and life contributed a little bit).  The comedown was very long and drawn out.  I laid on the patio for a while watching my fingertips spiral out into small black vortexes and spiral back into reality.  My thoughts seemed a bit more intellectual than usual as I considered theories of Quantum Physics throughout my head.  I considered that perhaps all matter really was just energy condensed into a slow vibration.  As I thought that, little things that I would look at would turn into small black dots and spiral in and out like atoms around a nucleus.  Later that night, the flow of everything diminished a little, but something in my heart kept flowing to the beat of whatever was happening around me.  When I went inside to lie down on a bed, my heart was flowing to the sounds of some music. Later, my heart was flowing to the stillness of the pillow that I was holding.     I went home around 12:00, still seeing tracers and still very confused. I was able to talk to my father though, and then I went to my room to lay down on my bed.  As the flow slowed further and further down, my experience faded further out.  So did my consciousness.  I fell asleep deeply around 3:00.  I woke up around 9:00 and was still seeing a few things moving and tracers were still apparent.  However, when I finally got out of bed at 10:00 that morning, I felt a little sore, but I was just fine after I got out of the shower.      I treat these seeds and any other gift form nature with reverence.  Know your body and know your environment.  If I send out positive energies into the world, the same positive energies will be bestowed upon me with charm.  This experience was amazing for me because I listened to what the experience was trying to convey and channeled what my personal experience is supposed to be.  Each time that I try entheogenic substances I always have specific and peculiar experiences.  Each one leads to a new revelation about the universe both around me and inside of me.  When trying any new substance, I turn my ears to the inside and listen to myself, and always know my limit and know how to keep control.  These things will help me to feel and understand the true teachings of the universe."
24504,Taken For Granted,Boll Weevil,"Mar 21, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"My last experience with HBW has stalled me in going further with other psychadelics and I wanted an outlet for it, as an introduction I\'m male, 22, a student in the UK.    I\'m a novice to psychadelics, I\'ve tried Salvia divinorum twice, last summer, both were the oral method.  Nothing much happeneed, I think I swallowed too much \'juice\' and possibly did it too late, when I was too tired.  One thing that did stand out was a feeling of uneasyness during that night when any effects that had happened should have worn off.  I found it hard to relax and get to sleep.  I can remember thinking \'why did I do this? I just want to stop and go to sleep now\' it wasn\'t a trip, just a feeling.      I\'ve tried Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds three times, the first was about two weeks before the trip this report is based on.  I\'d done 2 nice and easy exams that day and didn\'t have another one for a week and a half.  At about 7pm I scraped the coating off 3 seeds, chewed them up really well and swallowed them.  Not a lot happened for about 45mins I think but I gradually felt a little different.  I expected and felt the nausea but I also got that same uneasy feeling that I got with Saliva.  I thought \'maybe this is common with psychadelics and it means they\'re not for me\', I was lying on my bed watching TV at this time,  mostly with my eyes closed, the noise from the TV was kinda irritating.    Then there was a knock on my door (I was living in university flats), my flatmate asked me to the pub,  I felt a little giddy but no more than you do when you\'re tired or just woken up.  I almost went but didn\'t know what might happen later so declined.   Thought I\'d join him if nothing happened.  Flopped back on my bed and then everything changed! The uneasyness turned into a stoned feeling, I was cold so wrapped up in a blanket and sat up against the wall, it was getting a little darker, this and my fairy lights gave the room a nice warm glow.  Almost closing my eyes so I could see just the light from the TV and fairy lights was nice but I didn\'t see any real visuals or anything, it was just a nice stoned feeling all night.  I couldn\'t stop grinning...or drooling.  I was totally happy watching crappy TV. My legs were very stiff when walking though but apart from that there were no negative effects by then.  After 11pm I felt like I\'d passed through one phase and it was time to turn the lights off.  Fell asleep prolly around midnight and woke up at 4am, was still feeling some effects but I didn\'t want them anymore, they were more like the uneasyness from before and I just wanted to go to sleep now.  Managed to sleep fine, but woke up the next morning with a massive hangover.  Even so I really thought it had all been worth it, it hadn\'t taught me anything but it was a nice experience.    My 2nd experience was a no show, I\'d decided not to go out the Saturday of that same week and took 3 seeds again.  But I did them too late, after 10pm and fell asleep before noticing anything happening.    The 3rd -- and last --  was a nightmare but has left me feeling it wasn\'t all pointless.  I\'d had 3 pints of lager that day but I\'m not sure if that makes any difference, it most probably maded a difference to my last minute choosing to do the seeds.  This time I took 5 seeds, it was about 8:30pm when I swallowed them, I had the nausea but knew it would pass, got the stoned feeling, it was all happening as expected.  Then a friend came round for a cup of tea,  I wished I\'d pretended to be out, I did my best to act normal around her but by this time I couldn\'t stop grinning, luckily she just thought I was drunk and left after a while.     The stoned feeling stayed but it was a little different than the 1st time, pain became interesting, I was pinching myself a lot just for the feeling.  I can\'t remember when the sickness came back, maybe 3 three hours after taking the seeds but it did and it was a lot worse than at the start.  I was getting some visuals this time, with my eyes closed there were patterns,  lots of red,  green and blue (maybe this is because I do a video course so \'RGB\' comes up a lot) but magenta was there as well, lots of strings of DNA like patterns and lines.  I also had excellent photorealistic flashbacks of memories and scenes, I have a good longterm memory anyway but the scenes were crystal clear now and also completely random, I have no idea why certain memories were coming up.  These were interesting but hard to enjoy because I felt so sick and uneasy and my eyes felt like they were twisted and about to burst.  Once when having my eyes tested I had put drops in my eyes to widen the pupil to help them inside more, it felt like that but my eyes weren\'t actually as big this time.    I couldn\'t sleep, I was up all night, I was watching whatever was in the VCR at the time to try and get my mind off it.  Getting up felt awful plus my legs really ached.  I couldn\'t do anything but lay down though sometimes sitting up and moving relieved some of the sickness.  I tried to make myself sick but I\'m the world\'s worst at being sick, it just doesn\'t happen, I gave up on that quickly.  All night I was tempted to atempt walking to the hospital, I kept trying to convince myself that it would be over eventually and all I had to do was sit it out but thoughts kept creeping back in saying \'this is real, something is happening what if I\'m really doing myself some damage here.\'  I kept thinking of a story on erowid where a guy had taken hbw and called an ambulance when he felt sick, they just made him sit through it to teach him a lesson.  If I was going to sit through it I was definitely more comfortable in my own room, I doubt I\'d have been able to get to the hospital even if I had decided to go. I convinced myself I\'d wait until 8am and go down to the health centre.    At around 6am some relief was coming but only slight, I felt a few bursts of \'okayness\' and discovered that masturbation helped the feelings, yes I was ready to try anything at that point and it realy did bring some relief.  It was at this point that I believed it really was going to end and that thought made the nausea easier to deal with.  The last time I noticed on the clock was just after 7am.  I then WOKE UP at around 9am, first of all relieved that I\'d actually been to sleep and then found most of the sick feeling had gone.  The relief was amazing!.  I think I was able to sleep for a few more hours after that, off and on.      No after effects the next day, I was glad I hadn\'t gone to hospital or called anyone as I\'m sure there would be many consequences to deal with that day.  Since then it has made me feel differently about experimenting with different substances, I don\'t feel scared to I\'ve just lost the urge that I had before.  The thought of the seeds makes me feel sick, I didn\'t mind the taste when I did them but now when I think of it I feel sick and sometimes almost gag. It is still only a month since the trip however, I\'m sure this will fade.      When I was going through it I thought maybe I was being taught not to take the seeds for granted.  I hadn\'t gone into it that way but they led me into a false sense of security when they gave me the stoned feeling.  I didn\'t up the dose to get \'more fucked up\' I wanted to see what was there and thought I was ready,  so I don\'t know.  The day after I felt better for it, like it wasn\'t all wasted, maybe it was a journy I needed to be taken through.    So would I recommend them?  Well I\'ve had a good and bad trip so either of them could happen to someone else.  Just make sure you know what could happen and be prepared to deal with whatever comes up."
23986,The Best Therapy Session,Blown Away,"Mar 17, 2006",Morning Glory & H.B. Woodrose,"I began with a ton of research on LSA containing seeds; I wanted to ensure a positive, enriching experience.  I decided on the tried and true water extraction method.  After grinding the seeds as thoroughly as possible in a coffee grinder, I mixed it all in 2 1/2 cups of cold water, shook vigorously, and put it in the fridge.  For the next two days I shook it when I thought of it, and prepared mentally and spiritually for my voyage.  This included discussing the whole matter with my psychiatrist, who is unbelievably cool with whatever I throw at her.    2:00 pm  It is time to embark, and so I FILTER the concoction.  The key is to not ingest the seed matter.  Eating the seed matter is completely unnecessary because the LSA compounds have all been transferred to the water.  After filtering it with cheesecloth to remove the big pieces, I then used a very fine sieve to get the smaller bits out.  The resulting tea was dark brown, clean, and smooth.  I drank it down, and smoked a bit of cannabis to get rid of the taste, which was not exactly bad, but a far cry from good.    2:30  Already feeling the effects.  My scalp is tingling, and I am giddy and giggly.    3:00  Feeling nauseous.  It is time to take an OTC anti-nauseate: Emetrol.  This is a liquidy syrupy stuff.  Read the instructions carefully.  What worked well for me was to take 2 teaspoons every twenty minutes for a total of 3 doses.  And voila!  Just some burping, but I\'m feeling great.  Burping is good.         3:45  No cramping, no blurry vision, no nausea.  No pain at all, in fact.  Feeling good.  Listening to some good tunes.    4:30  I am starting to realize that this is going to be a very intense trip.  I underestimated the power of these seeds.  I should say that I have not had any hallucinogen other than cannabis for 5 years  I am very excited that I have found such an amazing legal, safe way to have a psychedelic experience.  It is time to take my dog for a walk.  (Should I say, it was time for my dog to take me for a walk).      6:45  Wow.  That was the most intense dog walk I have ever been on.  The gardens were so beautiful.  It\'s spring time here in California and the flowers are so fragant and colorful.  My dog was wonderful.  She was, and is, my guide through this part of my trip.  She charged ahead, and I gripped the leash and flew behind her like a kite.      7:00  I\'m tripping hard.  This has far surpassed my expectations.  I\'m no longer one with my ego.  My ego has made a nosedive for the window and a lot of emotions that I\'ve been surpressing and stuffing are coming up strong and fast.      The problem is, I\'m feeling very alone.  My partner is gone for the weekend and so it\'s just me and the dog, and the three cats.  I really want to call my therapist, but will that be way too wierd?  I\'m very afraid.  I don\'t want her to reject me.  I don\'t want her to say no, she can\'t talk to me if I\'m tripping.    My mind is blown right now.  I\'m crying.  It\'s all right to cry.  Just feel it.  Let it flow through me like waves.  I want to risk everything and call my therapist.      7:30  After an agonizing stuggle over whether to call my therapist, I pick up the phone and dial, leave a message.  I can\'t believe I\'m actually doing this.    9:30  Holy shit what a ride.  I\'m coming down now after a very emotional couple of hours.  My therapist called me back and we spoke for half and hour and I told her all the things I\'ve been trying to tell her for so long now.  It just felt so right, the time was right to open up to her.  I\'m feeling ecstatic right now.  This has been my crowning psychedelic experience.  No naptha or gritty seed meal required.  For that matter, no shady drug deal, no racing heart.  No puking.  A lot of peeing, but no puking.    My advice to potential MG and/or HBWR seed experimenters is to do everything you can to prepare yourself physically, emotionally, and spiritually.  I was wise to chose a time of peace and beauty to drink the tea.  With a little planning, I am on a spectacular journey.  For me it worked well to go into my trip with a few issues I wanted to work through.  Combining the seeds was a powerful experience, not to be undertaken by someone who is unprepared.    10:00  I\'m a seed convert.  I\'ll never do acid, mushrooms, or X again. All of the hallucinogenic/shamanistic experiences that I need are contained within these seeds. <!--Please purchase your seeds from a reputable internet source who specifies that they only sell seeds not treated with fungicide, pesticide, or any other nasty chemical you can think of. Don\'t expect a ton of--> Not a ton of hallucinations or visuals with the seeds. This is an inner high. I remained 100% coherent throughout the entire thing. During the peak of 7pm to 8pm it was pretty hard. But I broke through it and here I am on the other side.      Good luck!  For me it was 10 years of therapy summed up in a matter of hours.  I never imagined that I would ever talk to my shrink while tripping.  This has truly been a remarkable experience.  I look forward to the future!"
23885,First Time *WOW!*,EarthPrincess,"Feb 21, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"My Husband and I have done some reading about the effects of HBW seeds, and managed to obtain some seeds from a friends garden (organic).  I was a little scared, as I have only ever smoked a few \'herbs\' before, and never taken anything stronger. My husband, however, has experimented with a few other stronger substances...      It was a Sunday-lunchtime, we were at home and feeling very relaxed and comfortable, so we thought this was a good time to try.  We each had six seeds, which already had the fuzz removed, we ground them up just a little in our mortar and pestle, and added about 1/3 cup of water for each of our 6 seeds. We let this soak for about half an hour. Neither of us had eaten much this day (just a couple of small donuts each). When we swallowed this mixture, we were both pleasantly suprised at how little taste it had, we were expecting it to taste a little horrid.    About 20 minutes later, I started feeling quite nauseous, with a little dizziness, and had to sit very still for awhile. My husband felt a kind of tightening in his stomach, and a strange tingling in his head. Half an hour later, the \'bad\' feeling was gone, but we both felt the need to brush our teeth, as there was a bad taste in our mouths. We sat around for about an hour, just watching some tv, then we both got VERY hungry, it seemed like we ate everything in sight!    After we had eaten, we both started to feel very content and happy with everything, and seemed to laugh at nothing in particular. The experience I had of this was that my body was doing the laughing, and my brain couldn\'t quite catch what was so funny...    A short time after this, my husband was floating around the house smiling at everything, he said he hadn\'t felt this happy and relaxed for ages. I, however, had a stronger reaction. Everything seemed quite surreal to me, like everything looked like it was \'soft\', I don\'t mean the kind of soft that you\'d sink into, just surface-soft. I didn\'t feel at all like standing up, so I stayed put on my comfey couch. I began feeling as if I were somehow drifting slightly to the right of my body, like I was becoming siamese twins or something. It wasn\'t a scary feeling...just very strange. I felt like my body was a separate entity from my brain. I reasoned with myself that this wasn\'t so, but I had a hard time convincing myself! My body seemed to moving of its own accord - picking up a drink, having a cigarette, changing the channel on the t.v., which I didn\'t seem to be watching at all. At one point I was looking up at the ceiling, which is very high and made of bare timber, and I felt as if the house itself was actually alive, and breathing with me.    By the time 5 hours had passed since taking the seeds, everything was back to normal, and I was left with a sense of wonderment at what I had experienced. I felt so calm and happy with my life, not that I\'m generally unhappy, but this was an extreme happiness...  We made dinner and ate, and the food tasted terrific, like it was the best meal I\'d ever eaten.    All in all, this experience for me was fantastic, and I\'m looking forward to trying it again sometime. Though next time I feel like if I were outside in the bush somewhere, it would be even better!"
21084,My First and Last Time,Elephant,"Nov 18, 2005",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"My girlfriend and I finally decided to try the seeds after I had read much about them on the internet.  I have eaten mushrooms numerous times, and I have also tripped on acid.  Both my mushroom and acid experiences have ranged from pretty bad to excellent.  I fully understand that it is the nature of psychedelic drugs like these to have unpredictable effects.  Sometimes they are awesome, and sometimes you think you\'re gonna die.      I soaked 16 seeds in water for a day or so, and then spent a good amount of time scraping the \'skin\' off of them with my fingernails.  I then soaked them again for another day, and scraped them once again.  I had heard that the \'skin\' is the primary reason that people get sick when they consume these seeds, so I figured I\'d be as safe as possible.  The seeds were sold as 100% organic, so presumably there were never any pesticides applied to the plants during their growth period.      In any event, once the seeds were fully scraped, I ground 8 of them in a coffee grinder and dumped the powder into a container of water and let it sit for a few hours, shaking it up now and then.  I did the same thing with the remaining 8 seeds, but used a different container so that my girlfriend and I could be sure to have the exact same dose.  She is about 130 pounds, and I weigh about 150.  We both drank our slurries at the same time, but it only took about a half hour before she threw up.  My stomach was feeling pretty crappy, and although I wanted to throw up, I didn\'t.  Fortunately for her, vomiting got most of the seeds out of her body before she had a chance to digest them.      We took a walk and things started to get interesting.  My stomach felt pretty crappy, but I was still excited for the trip to come.  It didn\'t take too long before I felt horrible.  I tripped my balls off and had what I would describe as the worst 12 hours of my life.  There were some VERY weird side effects of the seeds that I wouldn\'t wish on my worst enemy.      I tripped hard, but not in a good way-- it was a totally bad trip.  One of the interesting things about hallucinogenics like LSD, shrooms, and LSA is that even though I know you just ate a drug, sometimes I cannot help but feel that I am going to be fucked up forever.  No matter how many times I told myself that it was going to get better, deep down I was never really sure.  My girlfriend helped to reassure me that eventually I would be okay, but it was a very difficult experience.    Physically I felt sick to my stomach, and visually everything was wacky.  The visual wackiness was typical of what you might expect from acid or shrooms, but not enjoyable at all.  It just made things more difficult.  At times I felt halfway between sleeping and waking despite the fact that I wasn\'t even close to being asleep.  I couldn\'t stay in one place for too long without growing extremely uncomfortable, so I had to go outside for a little while, then come back inside, then go back outside etc.      One of the strangest things for me was a definitive cyclic nature of the drug.  I truly believe that this was a strictly physical thing, and not mental at all.  What would happen is I would feel really bad for a while, and then gradually I would start to feel more normal, but then I would start to feel bad again, and then I would start to feel more normal.  The first time that I started to feel more normal, I got excited because I almost started to feel good for the first time.      The weirdest thing of all was the physical effects that would go along with the cycles of feeling good and then bad.  While I was feeling \'bad\' my hands felt very uncomfortable and tingly.  Then gradually I would start feeling better, and my hands would not tingle again.  Soon though my hands would start to get tingly and I could feel the \'badness\' coming back, as if I could literally feel the drug pulsing through my veins.  Also very strange was the fact that I literally could not have a conversation during the \'bad\' parts, but during the times when I felt more normal, my entire mental state shifted such that I could have a normal conversation with various friends who were around the house at the time.  But like clockwork, I would begin to feel my hands get numb and tingly, and I would start to lose my verbal ability, until I had to leave to go outside and do my best to make it through the next hour of uncomfortableness.      These cycles continued for the duration of the \'trip,\' which, incidentally was a full 12 hours.  At almost exactly 12 hours after we ate the seeds was the first time that I felt normal again, and it was an unbelieveably emotional experience for me because I had had such a harrowing experience for such a long time.  The cycles of \'goodness\' and \'badness\' got progressively shorter and progressively milder-- what I mean is that the \'bad\' parts were worse and longer lasting during the first hours after ingesting the seeds, but became gradually more tolerable and shorter lasting as the trip progressed.      I would put the entire experience in a category as the quintessential \'bad trip.\'  This was not only mentally and emotionally difficult for me, but physically, it was extremely uncomfortable.  During the \'bad\' periods, I felt sick to my stomach, tingly and numb in my extremities, and I felt on the verge of a yawn for the entire time.      To anyone who\'s thinking about eating these seeds I would say this... there is probably a reason that these seeds are not well known.  I think people aren\'t too familiar with them because they are not popular.  They are not popular because they are not enjoyable for the most part.  I could see how in some instances some people might have enjoyed consuming these seeds, but my guess is that you\'re much more likely to have a bad time than a good time.  This is coming from someone who\'s had plenty of mushroom and acid experiences.  My worst mushroom and acid experiences sucked in their own rights, but the suckiness was something that I could deal with as an experienced drug user.  However, the suckiness of the LSA seeds put me over the edge, beyond what I think any mentally stable, normal person could effectively and comfortably deal with."
20175,Comprehension of the Universe,Misty,"Nov 13, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"Well, I finally got another good trip with LSA. Good would be an understatement; it was amazing.    I posted about the HBWR tolerance thing a little while back. So I upped the dosage. The results were incredible.    A friend of mine and his friend who had flown down from Indiana were going to try my stash of LSA. We had decided on the local state owned park, but when we got there we discovered they had a nature preserve. No brainer. We went down there, walked a short way down the trail and peeled our seeds. I took 20, my male friends took 15 each. Ch had previously had an experience with morning glory.     I think we took the seeds around 3:00. The seeds were bitter and the taste made me gag. I spit up some of them but swallowed it back down.     The guys started feeling nauseaus within an hour but I still felt fine. We were laying on the trail watching the clouds. Some had rainbows in them and it was beautiful.    After maybe another hour the guys decided to make themselves vomit. So off into the bushes they go. They return. We decide to leave the park because its getting cold. I feel a slight change of conciousness but nothing big. We drive to Checkers. (Driving under the influence of something, even when it has not kicked in yet, is dangerous. There is the risk of it kicking in while driving. It is very irresponsible, do not attempt.) They decided to eat something. So they ordered the most vile looking thing i have ever seen. They call it \'chili cheese fries\'. I had conflicting feelings of extreme nausea and hunger while debating whether or not to eat the fries. We then drove back to my neighborhood park. I felt very sedated and did not want to move. I was starting to get visuals but I felt miserable. I decided to walk home.    As I walked home, my movement caused the nausea to build up until I vomited on some unfortunate person\'s sidewalk. Vomiting itself isn\'t bad, its the feeling of your stomach squeezing it\'s content out like a child trying to get that last bit of ketchup out of a fast food packet. After that I pulled myself together and walked into my house. Immediately I was hungry.     I looked in the fridge. Hmmmm. Turkey left over form thanksgiving? Sounds good. I took to my room and ate in an animalistic manner, with the realization that this was an animal\'s flesh. I studied it. Was this really a piece of a formerly living animal? Was it REALLY made of cells? I didn\'t know, but it tasted good. Kinda dry so I went back to get condiments. No gravy or gravy related substances. So, I\'d have to improvise! I looked at the potentials when i noticed boysenberry jam. And why not? In my state of mind, there was no reason these two foods couldnt go together. So i smeared it on. The seeds upset me because they were crunchy.    This event of me eating was important because after I finished I felt FANTASTIC. No nausea. No sedation. I felt free and mobile. I had a permanent grin on my face.  I was peaking. The visuals were beautiful. Pipes would intertwine and make letters of the alphabet. I squinted, wishing I could see them up close. Looking around, everything looked like it was being viewed through a screen. A screen of pipes. I looked up at the popcorn ceiling. Each popcorn was a different color with a different colored tip. The dimensions were different. I can\'t explain how.     Now, I have this black and white psychedelic design on my floor. Its a few feet in dimension and drawn on concrete in permanent market. I looked at it, and it colored itself in and added new aspects I never would be able to draw.     Looking at leaves on trees of carpet fibers, they would arrange themselves into tiled patterns. I kept trying to figure it out. How is it possible? How can it make the human mind view it in such a way?    I had freethinking. I wasn\'t overwhelmed with conflicting ideas but instead ideas would embellish upon themselves. I could grasp many concepts at once. I thought about different aspects of society, economics, government, people, all at the same time. I could comprehend the entire world at the same time. It was so horribly complex but at the same time, remarkably simple.     The bodyload I had experienced before vomiting was too intense, but after vomiting it was much more mild. Although when I tried to go to sleep, I could not get comfortable. Sleep would not come. Hours passed. Had the day really gone by so fast? Just this morning I ate the potential offspring of a hawaiian plant, and here I am, still here. Time is very strange. Sometimes you want it to go faster, sometimes you want it to slow down.    The great event of the day had to be right after I ate the turkey. My stepmother called me out to the kitchen. I had to empty the dishwasher! Oh god, I thought. How will I do this? I unloaded it dish by disk and made stack on the counter according to size, shape, and color. Normally I rush to get this done mindlessly.     Why do we have so much silverware? It makes no sense. What on earth does this weird utensil do??? Who invented the spork? Questions arose in my mind. My stepmother commented on my quietness. I was too thoughful to speak and besides, I couldn\'t rememeber what the default tone of voice was in a normal human being. Low? High? Fast? Slow? Oh well. not important. Returned to my room.    How could all this come from a seed? A seed is an unborn plant. A egg perhaps. Was its mother plant tripping? Can plants trip? So many questions. So much knowledge to be gained. Plants and nature are so beautiful.    Overall, this trip was very beautiful. Beautiful visuals, perceptiveness, appreciation.     Hints for anyone wanting to try this:    Be prepared for the purge.    Try to plan early. It takes a verrry long tiem to kick in, I think around 2 hours and 45 minutes to peak! So if you are planning a sunset in the nature preserve, or anything, time it wisely.     Do your research!     Please people, this is NOT \'cheap high\'. It is a real psychoactive substance and needs to be treated accordingly. It has wonderful self-exploration purposes and also is a great tool for appreciated the beauty of nature. After all, it is a natural substance."
18083,Remembering my Basic Iconography,Philbert MacAdamia,"Jul 26, 2005",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose,"As the colors on the trees outside changed I felt the need to appreciate it in as deep a way as I could. I couldnt wait for my mate to join me on the weekend, nor would I subject my friends to the heretofore untrodden path of the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seed. On a bright and beautiful eleven oclock morning, I found the seeds that were given to me by my soul brother.     I counted out ten as research suggested a dose to be for my weight and desired intensity. I spent a half an hour filing off the remnants of the husk that clung to the outside of the seeds, which were out of their pods, but were not yet what I considered to be prepared. I took a mortar and pestle and ground the cleaned seeds as near into a dust as I could. I read later that most people soak the seeds in hot water for hours first, but my time was short and this method proved to be acceptable to me.    After preparing myself I sat and mixed the powder with orange juice and drank it. I immediately felt a little queasy, but I had not eaten anything that morning so that ought to have been expected.    Over the course of the next two hours I grew increasingly restless as my body began to feel alien. Nausea became evident, as well as a slowly tightening jaw and a general feeling of drunkenness and mild confusion. CEVs began, but mild and lacking the dimension of LSD trips. I lay down to rest and listen to the music. It was close to T+2:00 when my sister-in-law arrived home from work early, much to my discomfort. After 10 minutes of feigning sleep I approached her and told her of my state, uncertain of her reaction. She was fine with it and it was a huge burden lifted from the experience.    At around T+3:00 I felt myself peaking. Nausea was gone, OEVs were visible now (though still lacking the dimension or vibrance of LSD or Psilocybin visuals, a quality I would learn to appreciate). I entered the experience with every intention of navigating my trip, to keep my mind focused and cognate. Up until this time I felt like a cork on the ocean, aware of where I wanted to go but unable to control the trip enough to get there. Now I still hadnt much been able to change the direction of the trip, but my mind was surprisingly clear, and certainly lucid enough to analyze the ideas and feelings I was exposed to.    It felt good to move. Proprioception seemed enhanced like with LSD, and dancing was second nature. I stood before a full-length mirror and danced to progressive trance music and my movements were fluid, beautiful and precise. I learned a great deal about dancing, and returned to the place where I have danced before on LSD. I was no longer fighting with my body with forced, quirky motions that characterize my usual dance style. My soul brother says on LSD I look like Jacky Chan instead of Charlie Chaplain.    I felt my body being pushed hard and I remembered that it was not my body that was in danger, but only my perception of it. I remembered that my body was nothing more than a symbol, an icon in a matrix of icons that all refer to each other in our Mundane World. I knew that I had the potential to shrug off this iconography, but that any breakthroughs in this state would risk being incongruous with the rest of the system on my return, and so I had to treat the icon of my body with care. The rest of the system of which I was a part would treat harshly the concept of bodily harm, even if I knew it was purely conceptual. I wanted badly to break through this iconography and I knew that in order to do so, my words would have to go as well. It then occurred to me that dropping the conception of the body would be tantamount to death\x85 And I was not afraid. On the contrary, what a release it was to know that its only a symbol, a concept that I clung onto so dearly every day! I also knew that there was much to learn in this iconographical system first, and other souls to learn from and to teach before I choose to let go.    That learned, I felt the rest of the trip could be enjoyed. Coming down, I went to a website of crazy visuals and knew that they were the product of the quality of the trip I now consider to be a distraction. I enjoyed them, but they were meaningless and I was no longer enamored with them. The focus of my journeys is now to pass through those distractions to find the truth beyond. I was grateful that the Baby Woodrose seeds did not tempt me with overwhelming visuals and that I was able to see this.    At T+5:00 I was back in my body. My body did feel sore, and my head began to ache slightly. OEVs were still evident. Overall, the experience was more lucid and \x91sharp than a Psilocybin trip, and felt much more like LSD. The short duration of the trip made it perfect for an afternoon, like mushrooms, but it still had the intensity and clarity of my LSD encounters. I consider the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seed a trusted ally."
14494,Poisoned,Aaron,"Apr 21, 2005","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Caffeine (tea)","In the past 15 years I\'ve tried a large variety of psychoactive drugs.  I have used hallucinogens extensively -- i.e. marijuana, LSD, psiloscybe mushrooms, and MDMA. I thought I\'d give HBWR seeds a shot.  I purchased them from a well-known ethnobotanical resource and have reason to believe that they were free of fungicides etc.      I tried them two times.  Each time I removed the fibrous black-grey coating from the seeds, rinsed them carefully, ground them quickly in a coffee grinder, and filled gel-caps with the resulting powder.  Both times I took the caps with hot decaffeinated tea on an empty stomach.  Both sessions began around 7:00 PM after relaxing, pleasant days.  Both times I smoked a small amount of nausea-relieving herb, first at ingestion and an hour later.    My first experience was a mixed bag.  I took 5 seeds this time.  The effects came on slowy, beginning within 30 minutes and building to a peak 3 hours later.  After an hour, I felt a great deal of sedation and nausea, but also waves of pleasant bodily euphoria.  I lay down for an hour and may have fallen asleep.  I came to feeling fairly intoxicated - I was moderately euphoric, felt mildly drunk, and experienced visual effects like those of MDMA.  Also, alarmingly, I had to work a little breathe.  My throat felt constricted and my face was swollen.  These alarming symptoms disappeared as I walked around investigating the mildly psychedelic effects of the seeds.    My second experience was terrible.  I took 8 seeds this time.  Again it took 3 hours to build up to a peak.  This time the euphoria of the first experience was absent. (I suspect that this just one of those random variations in drug effects.)  It was pretty neutral emotionally.  At their most intense, I would characterize the open-eye visual effects as being like those of Nitrous Oxide, some tracering, some random fluctuation of brightness and color intensity.  There were no CEVs.    But this time the adverse effects were much worse.  I was extremely nauseated.  My stomach was cramping and, most alarmingly, my breathing was extremely laboured.  I was yawning compulsively.  My throat was constricted.  I was badly congested.  My lips and fingers began to tingle.  I lay on the floor with my legs elevated for about 2 hours before I began to feel better.  The next day I was fine.    The \'trip\' itself sucked.  It didn\'t even have any of the metaphysical thrill of a bad trip.  I just felt poisoned.  It was a bit like I suspect a bad allergic reaction would feel, but I am not prone to allergies.  Maybe these were the effects of cyanogenic glycosides.  Maybe not.  I cannot explain what happened.  But I hope that I have provided some useful information here about the possibilities for adverse reactions.  Be aware."
38714,Frightening but Informative,Dan,"Dec 28, 2004",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue,"I have smoked grass and hash many times (in fact, regularly at times), and after trying Salvia Divinorum I decided that legal drugs might be worth investigating. After some internet research I thought I was ready, although I ignored the reports of people experiencing nausea; theyre just being fussy. Well, I learned the hard way that some of the things you read really ARE true. The place I bought the HBW seeds from also informed me that Peganum Harmala would boost the effect so I decided to chew on 5 seeds and drink a tea made from aprox 5 grams of Peganum Harmala. The whole day I had fasted (big mistake) and I downed 2 car-sickness pills just in case I was ready.    First of all, the tea was the most foul-tasting liquid I have ever tasted. As per recommendation I had used lemon juice to minimize the bitterness, but instead now it was extremely sour I simply could not finish it all, so I left about \xbc of the tea. While chewing on the seeds, which were not bad tasting at all, I decided to sit down to read until it all took effect.         After about one hour I started to feel a little light-headed but also a little, thats right: nauseous. Hoping it would not get any worse than that, I started spinning CDs and I was enjoying myself very much. It was like a milder sort of high, and different from anything I had experienced, but I was surprised to find that like marijuana it was quite a potent aphrodisiac, but unfortunately it didnt allow for, ehem, closure.           Another hour into the trip and it was still gaining momentum, and by now I was sick to my stomach. I tried to calm down by listening to more music, but for the first time in my life I was too out there to enjoy it. Im a big fan of jazzrock and 70s progressive rock, and always get a kick out of listening to that kind of music under the influence, but now it was just too intense it scared the crap out of me. In addition to that, now I had to throw up. Nothing I enjoy doing but I figured it would be no big deal. Only problem was that my stomach was completely empty, which is why I would recommend that you eat at least something before you try this, if only to make it physically possible to empty your stomach if needed. So, beginning to panic I started cooking (I had no snacks around), and looking back that could have ended badly as I kept forgetting what I was doing, if the stove was on, how long things had been cooking. To make matters worse, I could not stand still. I was running around my apartment like a maniac, sweating like crazy, stopping by the bathroom every other minute to push my fingers down my throat, bacause by now I really wanted the trip to mellow out.    The food was uneatable and I was sitting in the shower thinking that I might not make it through. Severe anxiety attacks coupled with physical pain as I was rocking back and forth with sweat pouring down my face. What am I going to do with my life? What does my family think of me? Why am I even living?. These kinds of questions rained down on me, but I couldnt find any answers to any of them. Then the really scary thing started. My thought gravitated toward the kitchen knife. I figured In this condition it would be so easy to stab yourself in the heart without hesitating. I was both compelled by this thought and scared to death by it, because it felt like in the end it wasnt up to me, but my mind, which was separate from me.         This took a while and about five hours after ingestion I was still sitting on the floor of the shower, but thankfully I felt like I wasnt just a slave to random thoughts anymore. Then the Beatles lyric Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream (or something like that) came to mind. From what I understand it is based on Timothy Learys intro to the Tibetan Book of the Dead, so I decided to give it a go. I stopped fighting against what my body felt, and I accepted that I had a bunch of problems in my life. Tadaa! Within a minute all the anxieties just went away, and even though I was feeling a bit queasy that wasnt a real problem. I got up and returned to the living room, and from the table the cover of the Grateful Deads American Beauty shone like a beacon in the dark. I put it on and slumped down in my couch. Things were feeling pretty OK all of a sudden; the music was very earthy and positive, which are not adjectives I normally identify with, but now I wanted nothing more than to be in sync with that feeling. It was getting light outside but I kept playing records and I had reached a calm state of mind that was heavenly.         The next day I woke up with a big grin om my face, and when I reflected on what had happened I was glad I went through it, though next time I would do it a little differently. Said and done, never again Peganum Harmala, and at least a water extraction of the seeds (10 seeds or more). I have done it about four times since, and even though the highs have not been as intense, there also hasnt been any anxiety attacks. There is still some nausea but not so much as to ruin the trip. Probably the most important thing is to not experiment with psychedelics when you are depressed or even slightly worried about something. In that respect HBW seeds are much more potent than pot, and requires more responsibility and self-discipline. If you are comfortable doing drugs in the company of others that would probably be a good idea in this case."
12003,Blissful,octo,"Dec 27, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"Dose: 5 cleaned seeds boiled    This was my first experience with this substance. This log was written during the trip.     I prepared a tea with the seeds.  First scraping the casings until they were a brighter/more alive color than the brown fuzz, softening them in boiling water, then took them out and sliced them each into 4 divisions with scissors, boiled again for 10-15 minutes.  Water was greenish, which was a little surprising.    4:45pm   Drank it.  It\'s not nearly as nasty-tasting as some say.  No chaser required.  Perhaps this indicates I should have ground them up more?    Will smoke some mj in a half hour for stomache-ease. In the future I will try to grind them up more and add some nice tea to the drink.    5:03pm  Already I feel something.  Movement is noticably different.    5:35pm  I\'m sort of \'tripping\' I would say now.  Smoked a small loosely packed bowl of some new weed.  Am high.  But also \'other\'.  Played guitar for a bit.  Am pleasantly tripping.      5:45pm  I\'m not sure if this feeling is actually familiar or if it just seems like it is.  But I feel like saying \'I remember what this is like.\'  but I\'m not sure if this is accurate.    [I\'d done LSD many years in the past, and I think that\'s where this feeling was coming from.]    5:55pm  Whoa.    6:25pm  Still getting stronger.    6:29pm  Movement is strange.  Not unpleasant.  All physical sensation is slightly more pleasant, warmer, more tactile, richer.  Balance is not exactly correct, but it may be because I\'m distracted by every sensation involved in walking.      [much like when rolling on e, I was rubbing my arms and sides and legs with my hands a lot.  Very very easily distracted by any physical sensation.]    6:50pm  This ffx puzzle is too difficult / boring.  I don\'t know which.    7:05pm  Feels like a lot of time has passed [since I wrote anything in the log] but it hasn\'t.  Bleh.    Tripping.  Agh!      [I was beginning to lose direct control over my actions/thoughts at this point.  I was sort of being tugged around.  I can barely recall the sensation now, and wish I expanded on it at the time.]    7:08pm  I have no sense of rythm.  Or I don\'t care to adhere to.  Not sure which.  S.e.r.p.e.n.t.I.n.e.  [I couldn\'t stop moving like a snake.]    Dancing with/to myself.  It is w o n d e r f u l.  Bliss.    Considering going to mcdonalds or some other fast-food.    7:12pm  If this is the peak, then this drug is a wonderful, mellow, pleasant, lovely alternative to LSD.  Much more forgiving, much more agreeable, much easier to work with.  Same place, same feel, similar head-trip, less sterile, less forceful, less aggressive.  Very positive.  I am a giant fan.      [I would further say that the period of time between 1.5 hours before and after the peak (for 3 hours total) is probably a nice analog to tasty e.]    7:20pm  Yes.  I want to go to a club.  Dance dance dance.  This is a fantastic drug.  I feel like being very social right now, but at the same time, and a little frightened by the prospect of talking to people.  Slight paranoia.    Amanita muscaria smells great.  Another trip, another day.    I want to get out of the house, but, am unsure.  I wish someone was here.  Maybe I\'ll just wander around the city.    7:25pm  Solvent is w on der f ul.  Still climbing.    7:35pm  Really enjoying this.    [I was sitting in my bed, playing guitar/singing along to the vaselines.  I was in a good place.]    7:45pm  I\'ve decided to have a cigarette.    [I quit a couple months ago, but really really wanted one.  Went to 7-11 and bought cigs with little trouble.  Slight paranoia.  Really enjoyed walking around in the fresh air.  But quickly realized I needed to get back to my apartment.  It wasn\'t panic-driven, but just an understood fact: I must return home.]    8:55pm  Still tripping.  Coming down?    Sleepy.    9:17pm  Coming down nice and smoothly.    6:00am the next morning.  At around 9:30pm last night I trailed into sleep and needed to puke but didn\'t.  Mild need to puke.  I sort of \'willed\' the feeling away.  Mild panic began when my roomate came home which further justified sleeping.    Woke up around 10:30 and dressed for sleep, still tripping.  Went back to sleep with some very vivid dreams.  Woke just now.  The dreams ended only now upon waking.    Oddly enough, the last dream ended like the end of an e experience at a club.  The lights were coming on in the club, but I wasn\'t ready to stop.  Everyone was very very tired and sad that the night was over.  It was as if I was being told, \'ok, the drug is done, the trip is over.\'    Overall impression: _powerful_ fun, pleasant.  No visual/aural hallucinations, but highly physical, not entirely dissimilar to e.  Less head-trippy than LSD, but now that I\'ve experienced this, I don\'t think I\'ll ever do LSD again.  A larger dose might be desirable, since I feel like I missed out with visuals/aurals.  But those nightmare stories are good warning against it.  We\'ll see.  I\'ve got plenty.    6:30am  Can\'t go back to sleep.    10:30am  Whoa, went back to sleep and had some extremely vivid dreams.    -octo"
37499,The Final Trip,Inf1nity,"Oct 19, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"Simple Preparation: Mashed seeds in ziplock bag with a hammer, threw them in our mouths and washed them down.    It was saturday night. My friend A* and i stared down at our crushed seeds with excitement and as the clock struck 8pm we shoved the gross mess into our mouths and washed it down with our hot cocoa. We both agreed it was a gross couple of seconds but our excitement outweighed the momentary distaste. We had planned to trip for weeks. We planned it out, and made sure not to eat them on empty stomachs. I had researched the HBW on Erowid thoroughly. I enjoyed reading the experiences though i admit some of the bad experiences did cause a little worry. I pushed those thoughts aside however, i was too motivated by the ultimate goal: tripping my ass off in any way possible. (I am of the belief that any trip on any drug can turn bad, it depends on the circumstances). Anyway, HBW seeds seemed to be the easiest to get at the moment. Shrooms were actually harder to find: we would have to wait for them, so I came to the conclusion that we could trip on HBW seeds in the meantime.    I was thrilled at the thought of experiencing this milestone in A*\'s mental evolution since she had never encountered any such mind altering drugs (besides our good friend Mary Jane) prior to this. This was truly going to be a great moment for her. In terms of myself, I pretty much knew what to expect: an enriching flood of assertions, a sense of well-being and understanding, a leap ahead in the race of knowledge; all catalyzed by the mind opening powers of 8 seeds. So excited.    In order to pass the time and to distract our almost menacing anticipations we decided to watch a movie. Fear and loathing in las vegas seemed to fit the genre of our pending state. Well, since neither of us had seen the movie, so that was the assumption; given that the only specifics that we knew of the movie were that it was drug involved. Well I would say that it wasn\'t the most positive movie to watch considering that Benicio del Toro and Johnny Depp lose total control of reality in a completely frightening and confusing way that is not the right representation of what was to become of us. Watch the movie. But not when youre about to trip.    After the movie was over A* and I came to 3 conclusions:    The first was that Fear and Loathing is the craziest movie ever. The second is that we felt uneasy and nauseous. The third, we had to smoke:    I knew we had to and so did A*.  I had this rising feeling inside me that was enveloping my focus. This feeling was that I needed to vomit. My previous experience with all forms of tripping have all included this right of passage, so it was expected. Not only that but I had read numerous accounts that HBW are a double-edged sword in that they cause nausea. In what was becoming an overwhelming sense of physical unpleasantry I finally forced myself to get up. As we made our way to A*\'s room to get the blunt I started to feel what can only be described as being \'drunk with nausea\'. In the courtyard between my door and hers I had to stop several times thinking I was going to hurl right on the sidewalk. As other college students going about their nightly activites walked by I knew i had to get to the bathroom fast. It would have been assumed that I had too much to drink, given no one would suspect that the girl stumbling around the courtyard is acutally tripping on LSA. I knew that regardless it would cause trouble. That\'s just what i needed, to be in an ambulance puking and tripping...right.    When we made it into A*\'s building I knew relief was coming, I just had to make it there. I must say, that phase before you actually throw up is by far worse than actually throwing up. Luckily, what seemed like a century later, as we walked up the stairs to A*\'s room, the overwhelming sickness reached an unpleasant peak. \'Faster\' I groaned to A* and we quickly ran up the stairs. I made my way drunkenly staggering in agony into the bathroom and let my pain out exorcist style into the toilet. Bye bye hot chocolate. Time to smoke.    We made it to the tree and agreed only to take a few rips each, so as not to defer the feel of the oncoming LSA.  I took about 3 good rips and A* took a few more. As we made our way back to A*\'s room we both started to feel a lot better.    As we sat down on the bed we both felt SO much better. And we didn\'t feel high at all either. We were tripping. As I layed there I fell into a zone of comfort. It reminded me of E: I was completely satisfied with just being. I lied there in my little world of happiness wondering if this trip was going to start becoming more mental, though I enjoyed the physical well being. Soon enough I knew this trip covered the spectrums, both physical and mental. So started my mental journey...    I remember looking at the clock, maybe around 12 or 1. This was about 4 hours after ingestion. From my readings I knew that HBW trips have a slow incline, rising towards one giant peak about 4 or 5 hours later and then a tapering off, whereas shrooms are more of a slight rise an hour after ingestion with a steadied peak that lasts straight 4-6 hrs and then a slow tapering. This was to be expected. We were reaching a strengthening peak. My analysis of living: I outlined it in brackets so that it may be skipped... since i don\'t expect what has meaning to me to have the same meaning to other readers, however i offer it nonetheless:        (((Basically my thoughts were pretty focused. My subconscious feeling of disconnection was surfacing. I can conclude this from my tripping desire to find a purpose. I thought univerally in terms of humans and what purpose they serve. My conclusion was that we exist to live, and to do exactly what we do, as we please. I used animals by example: they all have purposes, and are instinctively designed to do exactly what they do, exactly how they are, they just live. It becomes more complicatd as humans because we are given instincts to live naturally however we are also given free will and the ability to understand and alter our existance. I came to the conclusion that we are no different from animals in that our purpose is to do what comes naturally. Our scope of natural abilities is just more complex. I don\'t believe (like most other hippies) that exercising our complex abilities is wrong.     I am of the belief that we are given a life, and instincts and we should use them as a guide. Whatever it is that you instinctively feel you should do, is to be done. If it was not meant to be, then we wouldnt have the capability to do it. Animals do what they are intended to do. Otherwise they wouldn\'t do it. I believe that everything happens as it should, or it wouldn\'t happen. That is we can do no wrong as humans because we were given the capabilities do what we want. I took into consideration killing,etc. But i truly believe that if we lived as we were designed to do what we pleased in the most instinctive sense that things like that would not occur. In our most basic sense our instinctive goal is maintain ourselves physically and emotionally the best we can. I don\'t believe that those basic drives would lead us to do any wrong.     I used to wish to be an animal, that is to live without choice, to fit my designed program of instincts without worry. BEcause then i would do no wrong and live without the worries of wrong doing. But one thing i have taken away from this experience is that: i dont want to sacrifice my knowledge and my free will anymore. I am happy that humans can do whatever it is we please. There is no wrong.     And the final and most hypocritical conclusion was that analyzing is extremely overdone. Instinctively, we are meant to live emotionally and physically. Analyzation and its application can override our instinctive purpose to live. The only understanding we need is the understanding that we are. That\'s it. I felt that tripping gave me this understanding. And i hate to say it, i felt that tripping again, though most enjoyable and rewarding would be defiant of my conclusions. I don\'t need to trip anymore because what did i use tripping for? For furthering my understanding. However, this trip was the trip to end all trips. It gave me the final understanding, and for that I am grateful.)))    Now, I have no idea what time i eventually went to sleep but if i had to guess it was around 3am, 7 hours later, and i was still tripping when i fell asleep. The last thing i was doing was stairing at the pleasing visuals i was getting from staring at the Phish poster on A\'s wall and enjoying the sounds of Jimi Hendrix.    I woke up at 11:30am, not 100% normal. I forgot I was meeting my parents for lunch at noon! After a pleasant lunch with them i came back to my dorm and began writing this. Even as i sit here now my cognitive abilities don\'t appear to be top speed again. However at lunch i didn\'t feel apprehended by slowed mental and social connections. COnversation came naturally, though i was afraid my current state would leave me without much to talk about. Its now 3pm in the afternoon, the next day. My vision isn\'t even quite normal. A* drove home about 45mins, I hope she was able to focus on the road okay. If i stare too long i can see the visual remanents of the trip. Also there is a slower process of things cognitively like i said.    Overall I\'d say the trip was a very enlightening experience, as all should be. I can\'t say that I won\'t definitely trip again, maybe once more to see if my conclusions from this trip are confirmed; that i don\'t need to trip any more.     HWB seeds are good, if you can stand the momentary sickness. My friend A* took 6 since it was her first go, and she didn\'t vomit though she did feel sick. Pot adefinitely helped A LOT.     If i do trip again, i don\'t know that HBW seeds are practical only because of the nausea. So for the first time it was bearable, and rewarding in the end. Overall HWB seeds get 4 stars."
35656,16 Hour Trip Through Heart Pounding Hell.,Seaholm,"Sep 1, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"Though not the chemical imbibing psychonaut that some of you here seem to be, I\'m not exactly a neophyte either. So, it is with grave concern that I report to you a particularly horrific experience I had after ingesting a moderate dose of H.B. Woodrose.    Prep:    Since I wanted to do a solo test flight with this new substance I opted for beginning my experience early in the day, maximizing what I thought would be the comfort and security of daylight. The evening prior I had removed the fuzzy outer coating off of 9 seeds with a fingernail file. This seemed to take an extraordinary amount of time (1.5 to 2 hours). I then left the scrubbed seeds in a small plastic baggie overnight. Got up the next morning, ground the seeds into a fine powder with a coffee grinder, and then poured the powder into a shot glass. Poured in about a tablespoon of orange juice and a tablespoon of distilled water and I let the mixture sit for about thirty minutes.     10 AM - Poured the mixture into my mouth and tried to let it settle under my tongue. After swirling the mixture around for a little more than 30 minutes, I spit out about 95% of the mixture (with roughly 5% escaping down my throat.)  I guess this would be considered a partial sublingual method. Sat down on the floor and began meditating.    11 AM - Notice the strange, almost contradictory effects of drowsiness along with increased heart rate that are fairly common with strong acting plant entheogens. While not having much experience with synthetics (LSD, etc.) the effects I currently experienced felt familiar to other plant substances I\'ve had.    12 AM - Moderate intoxication sets in -- drowsiness combined with \'buzziness\' in the head, along with heaviness in limbs. Decide to lie down after sitting at my computer becomes uncomfortable. Take a short nap.    2 PM - Awaken from my nap in a great sweat with a racing pulse. Rapid thought cycling. Leg muscles cramping slightly. All fairly par for the course with LSA, or so I had read. Decided to get up and monitor my reactions and physical effects. Pupils widely dilated. Definitely tripping, but nothing too intense.    4 PM to 8 PM - Gradual escalation of intensity for physical buzzing sensations, piercing headache, body tremors, rapid heart rate, streaming thoughts of darkness and negativity. Once I realize how the mood is changing I begin a quiet meditation, attempting to ground myself as well as to welcome the direction of any spiritual source which may be guiding me through the experience. I kept praying, \'Please show me what I need to see. I come with good intentions.\' But, my visions continued to get darker and darker. Not hallucinations, but reflections on the horror and suffering of humankind. Other than feeling like I was going into shock, due to the sweats and hot-cold flashes, words like \'trippy\' \'sublime\' or \'spiritual\' are the last words I would use to describe my experience. Words like \'poisoned\' \'nightmarish\' and \'psychotic\' would be more appropriate. Really start to feel myself coming unhinged, not so much from panic as the physical and mental pain. At around 8 PM, roughly TEN HOURS after ingesting the seed mixture I hit the peak, when my whole world is wrapped in a buzzing, twisting, downward whirlpool of negative energy. It then dawns on me how much time has elapsed since the morning, and I began to fear that I may have done something catastrophic with this plant mixture. I couldn\'t believe it, but the old \'am I dying\' cliche started passing through my brain.    9 PM to Midnight - After experiencing little nausea up to this point, my body decided it was time to try purging the toxins from the inside out. I had eaten a few soda crackers a couple of hours before, along with 500 mg. of Niacin and a little orange juice. Medically, I knew that I couldn\'t have any seed extract in my stomach, but as soon as the vomit came up, I felt a hot electric current surge through my body from my feet to the top of my head, with my whole body vibrating from the inside. Essentially, I had somehow just triggered an even more intense experience. Feeling angry and betrayed, I flew into a rage. And, I began cursing whatever force was dragging me through this pointless exercise in misery. On the edge of tears and hysteria I simply dropped back down into my bed, accepting the waves of painful vibrations surging through my body and the horrific thoughts flowing through my brain. I briefly considered calling an ambulance, but experience told me that if I hadn\'t died after 13 or so hours, I probably wouldn\'t now. Around midnight I started to notice an almost imperceptible lowering of my heart rate, and my chills turned down a notch or two. Encouraged that I might actually be coming down I then dozed, thankfully, until around 1:30 AM.    2 AM - Get up and see that my pupils are still big as saucers, 16 HOURS AND I\'M STILL TRIPPING!  But my heart beat has leveled out, my legs aren\'t feeling as cramped, and my thought patterns seemed to be getting more even. I still felt an intense body ache and a piercing headache along with the omnipresent buzzing. For the next couple of hours, exhausted and furious I contemplate throwing my remaining bag of almost 50 grams of seeds into the trash. Were it not for a fellow psychonaut who experiments in the chem lab with different substances I acquire, I would have pitched them.    So, how to summarize? What do I make of all this?  I really don\'t know what to say. Dose? Well, 9 seeds taken sublingually and then spit out doesn\'t seem that extreme. No other drugs in my system for weeks, so nothing to interact with. Set and Setting? All in all, I was calm and reasonably level-headed when I ingested the H.B. Woodrose. My condo and surrounding neighborhood were quiet and peaceful on the day of my experiment. I wasn\'t put through any stressful situations externally.     What the Hell? All I can think of, all I can reasonably assume: 9 H.B. Woodrose seeds were introduced to my particular body chemistry and they were not my ally.    Wish I could talk with some of you about this experience. I\'m still shaken up by it. I\'ve never heard of a trip lasting this long on ANY SUBSTANCE! What does this mean!? How is this even possible!?"
24412,Seizure-like Experience,Dr. taint,"Jun 10, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"Let me start off by saying that I thought since these were relatively obscure and legal that I wasn\'t going to have much of an experience. Was that ever a stupid assumption.    Upon receiving a mailorder of the seeds along with some ayahuasca, me and my friend Suzie decided to try the seeds right then and there because we figured unlike ayahuasca we wouldn\'t need to excersize a lot of care and planning.     [5:45] after scraping off the coating of 5 seeds each, we chewed them up and held them under our tongues for 15 minutes. We were planning on spitting them out after that to avoid nausea and then decided to just swallow them.  My wife who we will call \'driver\' drove me, suzie and suzie\'s sister to a nearby lake about 40 minutes away from our place.      [6:00-6:30] it\'s a hot ass day outside (95 degrees), sun is beating down.  Starting to feel some subtle effects, mostly just nausea but not overpowering nausea. Driving on very windy roads to the lake, trying not to get sick.  Mood is generally excited and happy.    [6:40] we arrive at the lake, and upon getting out and walking I really started feeling the effects. I felt kind of weak and ticklish around my knees and my upper legs felt stiff, like I had just excersized.  Objects appear very funny and take on personality much like on mushrooms.  I am pleased that I\'m tripping off of just 5 seeds (I read that was a low dose).  We get in the water and swim out to the buoy and it feels fantastic.  Sun is reflecting off the water and sparkling everywhere.  I lie on my back with my ears submerged and just my face sticking out and swim backwards looking at the sky..total tranquility.  As I reach the buoy I feel like the trip was already ending.  It seemed that being in the water made me completely unaware of the effects.  My imagination seemed to be having a field day..as I swam to shore, ears submerged listening to the hum + swishing sounds of the water I distinctly imagine myself in my mothers womb.  I got to shore and as I\'m climbing out into the air I had this evolutionary vision of walking on to shore for the first time.  Almost as soon as I get out of the water the effects come rushing back.      [7:20-8:00]  this was a very confusing part of the trip.  The effects strengthened (very strong body buzz, general surreal feeling) and I was in one of those states where I was anxious and pacing, then lying down and trying to form a thought in my head to no avail.  I felt kind of vaguely sad and introverted, and the nausea was bothering me a bit (but not enough to puke). Again I can\'t really pull an emotion into mind, I can\'t really tell how I am feeling.  I was in a strange stupor that I haven\'t felt before on any other popular drugs.  At this point I kind of wanted the experience to end because it was no longer pleasant.  I decided lying on my back and being sad was going to throw me into a bad trip so I tried to make small talk with my other friend who is tripping, and we went and looked at an ant colony and talked about ants.     [8:20] we decide to leave because we have to go meet a friend back in town.  I begin to feel good again and the mood is happy amongst everyone.  Then I begin to feel very nice ecstasy like rushes of pleasure.  We put on Sonic Youth in the car and the music is fantastic.  I would say at this point I am peaking.  I can compare the feeling to mushrooms, ecstasy and marijuana but not exactly like either of those.   its a very euphoric drunk trippy feeling.  The nausea has not subsisted however and at times I begin to worry how this drug is affecting my brain as I have had major depression problems when I used to use ecstasy.  I become worried that after I come down I will REALLY come down and go into a severe depression like I had experienced with ecstasy.  I then begin thinking about how there has been almost no reasearch on the effects of this drug and that I might be permanently damaging my brain, etc, each paranoid thought leading into another.      [9:00] I finally brush off these negative feelings and enjoy the waves of pleasure and driving down the dark road at night I feel like I\'m drifting in space as the sky merges with the asphalt.  I\'m really enjoying this, and then all of the sudden I get a wave of severe panic out of absolutely NOWHERE.  This is very frightening and I want it all to end, and then another wave of panic and insanity I can\'t even begin to explain, like my brain glitched and locked up...and then I get horrible vertigo and pin pricks all over my body, I feel myself losing consciousness, I feel like I\'m poisoned and am dying right there, I wan\'t to tell them to take me to the hospital. all of this is in total silence as I don\'t want to amplify the trauma by making everyone else in the car panic.  So I sit there wanting to die, feeling completely insane in silence and then I feel the overwhelming urge to vomit, and I manage to tell the driver to pull over.     I vomit many times outside of the window and kind of hang there trying to gather myself after this horrible moment.  I am in a cold sweat and pretty traumatized by what just happened..I\'ve never experienced sheer terror and insanity like that in any drug I\'ve ever had, not with lsd, mushrooms, ecstasy, or anything else.  And it appeared to come out of nowhere like a seizure.  it scared me absolutely shitless, and for the rest of the ride I am sitting there in silence trying to recover from what just happened and wondering if I blew a fuse.  I feel terrible for putting my wife in this position and for giving the seeds to another human being.  I feel stupid for recklessly taking something I only know about from internet forums.      [9:20] we get to our destination and I am lying on the sidewalk being comforted by my wife (god bless her) and am slowly coming back to reality.  I am feeling more and more sane and happy that I got through that moment without hurting myself or having to go to the hospital and creating a real catastrophe.  I begin feeling very excited to be alive and happy that it was over.  I spend the next few hours hanging out with close friends and thanking god that the whole thing is over, and am able to laugh about it.     Overall I would say that it was a beautiful experience but also terrifying.  I don\'t know what happened to me when I had that episode, but I know thats NEVER happened to me before in my life, and I wanted it to end so desperately that had I been any more fucked up I might have done something crazy.  So I advise anyone to respect these seeds and DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THEM!!!! I have had \'real\' drugs that didn\'t even touch the potency of these seeds.  Also don\'t make the mistake of referencing other peoples experiences to predict yours, everyone is different.  These may sound like regurgitated warnings but I have found them to be true.  I wouldn\'t sit here and type this out if I didn\'t feel an absolute responsibility to do so after last night.  be safe & take care of eachother!"
21266,Twitching Buds of Lust-Pain-Matricide,SullenChoirboy,"Feb 15, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"Wednesday night I decided to test some HBWR seeds. It had been roughly 8 months since my last attempts with LSA, most of which were unsuccessful and all of which were with Morning Glories. I really wasn\'t expecting much, but I was curious as to how different I\'d find it after a bit more psychedelic education and experience since last use.     The day of the trip was focused and relaxed, as they always should be. I had to wait a while for my one comfortable tripspace to clear so I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas at my computer. Shortly before 12 AM, near halfway through the movie, my cohabitants dragged themselves to bed and my den became available, so I ate 6 preshaved HBWR seeds. I continued to watch the movie while I waited for onset. My only previous meal for the day was a plate of ribs four hours earlier, though in hindsight, one really should fast for an impending LSA trip.    Something like half an hour later, body load was taking hold in typical LSA fashion. Fortunately, I had a bag of supplies which included a cigar. I\'ve found tobacco to be a miracle cure for drug-related body loads and nausea, so I stepped outside and took several hits, and my suffering quickly subsided. There was an excitement in the air, something I noted in my first LSA trip. It\'s a pleasant electric high. I soon extinguished my flame and went back to watch the movie in peace.    Things progressed from here. I was reminded of one time I took a small dose of jurema and tried to watch this very same movie. The on-screen events began to get more confusing and chaotic. I was losing interest by the time body load came back in force, probably an hour after dosing. Once again, I remedied with lovely nicotine and cold soothing winds on my bare skin.     I then tried to finish the movie, but I quickly realized that I\'d much rather find a more comfortable setting. I sat in my dark den and listened to Shpongle\'s Tales of the Inexpressible on the cd player. Nausea wouldn\'t stay at bay for as long this time. I was only able to find solace in the most still of positions on the couch, lying on my back, head propped up, unmoving. Smoking a couple bowls of \'Merlin\'s Blend\' herbal smoke propelled me into a dreamy and hazy relaxation. I started drifting away to the soundtrack of beautiful psychedelic pulses and phasers. There was a strong body high.    As time and the album progressed, my conscious mind was split in two. Initially, the visual reality presided over my head, but a boundless dream world began stirring and begged to take over. I first noted this when I heard the sample of McKenna speaking of walls crawling with geometric hallucination. It was as if one eye projected such hallucinations while the other held fast to waking reality.     My more presumptuous eye\'s efforts were futile in the end because the dream world gained control. My trip was gaining momentum and I kept slipping into dreams. Motion trails were now quite pronounced. I feared that I might fall asleep, unfortunately, so I had to keep myself awake so as to not be discovered in a drugged state when morning came. This was an unpleasant realization because even the slightest movement sent waves of paralyzing body load and nausea throughout my body.    Nevertheless, I decided to leave glorious Shpongle and comfortable couch together in order to keep myself conscious in the glow of my soul-sucking PC machine. Here, I listened to The Beatles\' Magical Mystery Tour and started drawing in Paintbrush. I was out of my head at this time, not realizing what I was doing. I was sucked into a divine mission of manifesting these throbbing, profane visual projections into digital reality. The trip was quickly turning into something not quite as pleasant as before, starting as soon as I began on this drawing, yet I was forced to continue.    My body and mind sunk into worse and worse states during this time, which lasted a couple of hours. I felt very sick. My thought processes were increasingly negative. The worst of all this was a very disturbing occurrence in my stomach. A sudden contraction came about there, feeling as if this particular organ suddenly folded in half. This nearly choked me as I coughed and gasped for air.    I wasn\'t comfortable here, by all means, but fear and a rising case of tunnel vision kept me staring and working intently. The body high was turning into muscle cramps and stiffness. My acid reflux was overly active. It was physically quite painful, and I was finding that the emotional suffering was only just beginning. At 4 AM, four hours after dosing and two hours into my awful art session, I think I really started to peak.     This is is my usual bedtime, always allowing me plenty of time to safely venture up to my room before others wake up for work and the sunrise peeks in to exhaust all sins of the night. I shut off the computer and began to collect my things. I was lost in a void of psychedelic disassociation at this point. I walked through each room several times, forgetting that I had already been through and feeling very confused.     I eventually got all of the incriminating materials that I\'d spread out during the night into my backpack and it was time to retreat to my bedroom, but I wouldn\'t be so fortunate. The muscle cramps were near-paralyzing, but it was the freshly manifested auditory hallucinations that kept me frightened and unmoving. I couldn\'t come anywhere near the staircase due to this paranoia. Instead, I opted to sit on my couch and calm myself in order to try again. I put all of my effort into relaxing myself and smoothing out my breathing, but no amount of focus would bring success.    This went on until the clock struck 5 AM. I knew that I was in certain trouble now. My parents would be descending to my area very soon. I realized my only chance was to hide under a blanket and pretend to be asleep. I was very scared and kept visualizing all the screaming and general conflict that would come once I was discovered in this state of profuse sweating and large pupils.    I lie still waiting. What would become of me? I was lost in the discord of an infinite flux of infantile hard-ons and twitching buds of lust-pain-matricide. I closed my eyes and saw shifting kaleidoscopic views of strange creatures, fracturing and screeching in primal, painful language. Demonic owls belted out flanging Hoo Hoo\'s as I aligned myself with tragedy. I looked towards the television to find my sanity. It looked as it always did, but the sounds coming from it were not in a language I knew. Auditory hallucinations were very strong. All I could hear was incoherent grunts and babbling laid over perfect recordings of music I\'d heard that day.    I was in despair. I very much wanted to calm myself, but my breathing was hopelessly erratic and the burning of my insides was all too much for me. If I made it through this, I decided, I would have to change my life. I would have to stop putting myself through such suffering. Intently I searched the planes for better ways and new highways of my-ways. I made all sorts of false promises to myself, as if to bargain for the reception of my sanity. I was caught in loops of thinking, all focused on finding sanity, sobriety, peace, and comfort. I thought there had to be a way. It didn\'t seem right that 6 HBWR seeds, which is listed as a \'medium\' dosage on Erowid.org would have this strong of an effect, especially when I considered myself an LSA hardhead.    I did manage to pull through this. It was difficult, but through mindless chanting I was able to convince myself that it was going to be alright. \'This is for the best,\' I repeated to myself. \'This is necessary,\' and I started to believe it. I realized I could learn from whatever came and that this would probably turn out to be an incognito blessing for my wretched self. I began to feel a lot less pessimistic at this point. I might even say I had become anxious to receive my punishment. All I had to do was wait.    So I did. I won\'t go into the details of the following events, but I became paranoid again and lost the optimism. I had very strong auditory hallucinations, moderate to strong CEVs and OEVs, and one hell of a disgusting feeling in my body. At 10 AM, having somehow safely made it through the barrage of physical, emotional, and social obstacles, my trip was quiet and it was time to try to sleep it off. I vomited for a few minutes and headed off to bed. I managed to sleep for a few hours.    When I woke, I felt much like how I did after the first bad trip I had with LSA. My head ached and I felt feverish. I couldn\'t eat for fear of immediate regurgitation. This all lasted a few days. It\'s been five days since this experience and I am still having trouble sleeping. I\'m not keeping the ridiculous promises I made to myself, but I do feel glad to be alive, if not a little confused and a lot less sure of necessary upcoming plans.    I\'ve had two exceptionally bad trips in my psychedelic career, both with LSA. The depths of despair it can put me in are frightening. I\'m still relatively new to psychedelics and still experimenting to find what I like. These awful LSA experiments certainly don\'t seem worth repeating. I feel strange now. Still, despite all the ills of this experience, I\'ve learned in my maturing into adulthood to be grateful for every moment and learn from each accordingly. It is not entirely regret that I feel now, just a little confusion. Maybe I just need to find my way."
7110,H. B. Woodrose Can Kill You... Use Caution,Almost Poisoned,"May 29, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"argyreia nervosa seeds- or hawaiin baby woodrose- those are what we\'ve eaten to trip... this may be why they are bad.  the bark on the outside of the seeds contains cyanogenic glycosides- which even if peeled can leach into the seed during the soaking process or can exist within the seed itself naturally.  i really suggest not taking these and if you do, be sure to boil them in hot water and peel them while they are still moist( this can kill the enzyme that initiates the poison- but not always entirely successful in doing this) get ALL OF THE BARK AND HAIRY STUFF OFF!!  I still don\'t suggest trying this. i don\'t know why they websites that tell you how great they are don\'t warn you about this kind of thing:    CYANOGENIC GLYCOSIDES- Most people have heard of cyanide at one time or another, but few ever realize that such a deadly compound can be very easily derived from innocuous appearing \'natural\' sources. Basically, cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides are proof positive that although something is natural, it still can hurt you. This is a group of chemicals found naturally in about 2050 plant species. These are glycosides of plant origin that specifically affect the heart. The ingestion of these chemicals can lead to cyanide toxicity. Effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, cherry-red blood, vomiting, bloody vomiting, lethargy, hallucinations, seizure, coma and death.    Members of the rose family, Rosaceae, often contain compounds called cyanogenic glycosides. These compounds, when broken down in the body, liberate cyanide, one of the most toxic substances known to man. It\'s lethal dose is only 1 mg/kg body weight. Luckily for us, the concentration in these plants is usually far below the toxic dose, and the breakdown of the cyanogenic glycosides is often not complete. However, several species in common cultivation do have high concentrations of the glycosides in their seeds, and eating these seeds can (and has been) fatal. These toxic seeds include apple seeds, argyreia nervosa seeds, cultivated cherries, peach and apricot pits, almonds, and pears, which are all members of the rose family. It is only in the crushed, moistened seed which releases an enzyme can the hydrolysis of amygdalin be effected.  Soaking and grating release the enzymes that can turn cyanogenic glycosides to active cyanide inside the body.   The leaves of wild cherries will also contain the poison. Some other common plants which can generate cyanide include hydrangeas, tropical lima beans (not the white american ones), bamboo sprouts, sorghum shoots, and cassava tubers. Cassava, in particular, is very toxic, and cannot be eaten raw; this is important since large parts of the world use cassava as a main carbohydrate source.    Seek medical treatment immediately on any suspected case of poisoning.    *these seed have caused myself and some others a great deal of mental and physical pain, as well as a near-death experience, please post this, it could save someone\'s life*"
2686,More Stimulating than Hallucinating,Psychedelic Sunshine,"Oct 5, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Well I had been experimenting with many different chemicals since I came across the wonderful world of psychedelics, ketamine, LSD, salvia, DXM etc etc, with varying degrees of success, my recent exploration has been done with those strange fellas Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds, here is my wisdom on my subject.    The first time I tried HBWR was with five seeds, everyone was out and I knew I wouldn\'t be disturbed for atleast three hours which would leave enough time for the stuff people usually do on psychedelics, dancing, listening to music, laughing at walls, meditating, I\'m sure most of you fellow psychonauts out there know what im talking about so I won\'t go on.    Five seeds had been crushed several hours before into a fine powder, the powder was placed in a glass of warm water, stirred and left to sit in the sun for about three hours. The water had turned a kind of shitty pale white kind of colour with bits of crap floating about in it by the time  got back to it. I drank the mixture expecting it to taste foul, but it didn\'t taste as bad as I thought it would.    After about thirty minutes a slight nausea was felt, nothing strong (I should mention at this point that I hadn\'t eaten a huge amount all day so that may have reduced the nausea somewhat).    An hour and a half since I\'d drank the mixture whilst taking a crap I started to feel the usual \'shit I\'m coming up\' kind of feeling, I reached for the mirror and \'low and behold\' my eyes were slightly dilated. The next few minutes were full of the usual \'wow it\'s worked\' and \'so im still alive, wait a sec lets check my pulse\' kind of feelings. The tingling feeling of anxiety and excitement, the random giggling which could be either the drug kicking in or the feeling of self satisfaction that its actually begining to work and so on.    I immediately went into my room and turned on some music, pretty good, not so much a connection to or enhancement of the music, but the music definately sounded louder, and when I closed my eyes I was lost in a sea of thoughts, occassionally coming back to reality and the music. For some reason I decided to wander downstairs and eat something, I grabbed a slice of water melon and went outside on the patio, (I dont know how long I\'de been upstairs but the sun was starting to set so it must have be a while). The stains and marks on the red and yellow floor tiles started to become more vivid and \'alive\', I started to \'see\' witches on broomsticks, insects and other things (let me mention that I was NOT \'hallucinating\' in my opinion, my mind was just off on some wierd imaginary journey, and I think the dilation of my pupils might have had something to do with it). I layed back and stared at the sky for a while (always a good thing on psychedelics), the colour of the sky was a more vivid vibrant blue, and the clouds were bright and white and fluffy, no wonderful colourful geometric patterns though, as with LSAs big cousin LSD. After a while of this I decided to watch the sunset, the colours were beautiful, and as I looked at the sun I could almost feel the light go into me/through me, I stood there for a while and took it all in.    The mental and physical stimulation was something like that of other stimulants/hallucinogens but not as intense or as mind alterering. The feelings of exileration to the point of dizzyness were pretty cool. The euphoria was less than MDMA but more than marijuana, there was a definate mood-lift, nothing too extreme but it was there.    A while later I decided to see if taste was enhanced, so a trip to the fridge was in order. I drank two particularly huge glasses of orange juice (I was drinking ALOT of liquid since I came up, I was also pissing constantly too), I ate a few little things too, but everything tasted \'artificial\' somehow, pretty disgusting now I remember it, I also ate some chillies and couldnt feel much of a burn...so tastes (as with alot of other chemicals) was most definately not improved.    About 30 mins after this I played on some video games, they seemed boring, and my attention span wondered constantly and I couldnt get into the game at all, I couldnt even see the TV properly becuase my eyes were so fucked (dilated, stuff seemed too bright etc).    After a good three or so hours I started to come down, I felt tired, clumsy, and my mind was a little \'numb\' , kind of like the day after a good dose of MDMA, but this in itself wasn\'t particularly unenjoyable, and all part of the psychedelic experience, after all if I didnt want to \'come down\' I wouldnt have \'gone up\' in the first place.    Ive tried HBWR seeds several more times since then, I never felt as good as I did the first time and the feelings weren\'t as intense either. Once with nine seeds I felt almost \'drunk\' and euphoric, with a kind of brain dead feeling all the way through about 6 hours, this wasn\'t exactly \'bad\' though. Another time I tried nine seeds, I was really really fucked, ill, tired, couldnt sleep etc, which just shows the unpredictability of these seeds...proceed with caution.    My conclusion with HBWR is that you can never be to sure (as with all natural psychoactives) of the amount of active compounds in the plant, therefore it makes for an unpredictable experience at the best of times. But all in all ide say I learnt alot from these little plants, and its yet another chemical notch on the bedpost to be proud of. My advice to people would be; if you want to \'trip\' do LSD or something, but if you want to have a good time and generally enhance the situation then these seeds are for you, not to intense, easily managable and legal (but for how long with this persecution of psychoactives with the so called \'War On Drugs\'?)."
115448,Tripping in the Middle of Nowhere,High Guides,"May 21, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"I ate the seeds at my house. I didn\'t prepare them in any way other than grinding them with a mortar and pestle, as ground seeds are more easily digested. I can\'t stand the taste of CWEs and I\'m completely out of my LSA extracts, so plain seeds were my only option.    Set: I\'m curious about tripping while hiking, I really have no expectations. Mindset is positive.    Setting: My house, on a Sunday afternoon. No for work the next two days. I chose to trip alone, however I told some friends beforehand what I was doing so that I could reach out to them if things went poorly.    + 10 MINUTES    After eating the seeds, I decided to sit down to keep my nausea in check. I cracked open a window for some fresh air and watched It\'s Always Sunny while waiting for the sickness to go away.    + 90 MINUTES    After laying down for around 90 minutes, I figured that the worst of the nausea is over and that I was ready to go outside.    As I got myself ready, I started to experience some mild dissociation. It felt somewhat like being drunk, in the sense that there\'s a ""lag"" between what I was thinking and what I was doing, however I felt more sedated than intoxicated. I took sunglasses with me, as well, so that I wouldn\'t get blinded by the sun while my pupils were the size of dinner plates.    I went into my backyard and walked into the woods behind my land. I live in rural Maine, so I don\'t have any neighbors that will walk up on me tripping in the woods, making the area the perfect spot for an experience like this.    + 2 HOURS    The effects start to get stronger as I begin hiking, especially the time distortion. I feel like I\'m aware of every moment that passes and every small movement I\'m making with my body. My headspace begins to get really trippy, however it\'s not like other psychedelics -- it feels much calmer, more ""natural"" (somehow, if that makes any sense), and even a bit delirious. I\'m enjoying the come-up and can\'t stop smiling!    Visual effects at this point were very weak compared to the intensity of my headspace. There was some distortion in my peripheral vision as well as mild tracers, but nothing notable other than that.    + 3 HOURS    About an hour into my hike (and nearly 3 hours post-dose), the peak effects set in. I stop walking and, instead, begin examining random objects lying around in the woods near me. I stare at seemingly boring objects and notice that they have so much more intricacy than I had previously realized. One rock that I saw, for example, had swirly light-gray and rusty orange layers -- these layers look like they were ""flowing"" along with the grooves and cuts of the stone, and I couldn\'t focus my eyes on one spot. I also experience incredibly intense internal hallucinations while doing this: I feel like I could visualize the history of the object I was holding, like how it was formed and how it related to me. The peak headspace effects were truly wild.    I settled down next to a small pond and continued to hang out in nature for an undetermined amount of time. I don\'t remember what I was thinking about, but I do remember having a wonderful time just sitting and watching the cold woods around me. Here\'s some photos of the tripping spot that I took this morning, after sobering up.    + 5 - 6 HOURS?    After a while, It was starting to get darker outside and the temperature had dropped below 30F, so I was ready to head back. Fortunately, the trail I took has no forks or turns, so finding my way out was simple.    I was still tripping hard when I got home, but the peak effects were beginning to die down. I called a few friends over, made some food, and got ready to wind down. We watched a few movies before calling it a night.    Today, I still feel a bit ""foggy"" and slightly dissociated, but overall I\'m fine. I didn\'t get much value from my experience in terms of personal growth, but that\'s alright; I\'m not going to complain about having a carefree trip.    There\'s no way for me to put the headspace into words. If I were to oversimplify the experience and break down its effects by category, I would call LSA 60% psychedelic, 20% sedative, 20% dissociative, and a dash of deliriant. Of course, this varies for every person and this is just my interpretation based on my personal experiences.    I have read many reports of people experiencing intense visuals on LSA, however my experiences seem to be primarily headspace. I grow my own seeds, so I can\'t imagine that the lack of strong visual effects is because my seeds are old or weak from being shipped -- maybe it\'s just something to do with my personal makeup.    HBWR is a truly beautiful substance. Please make sure to use it responsibly so that it can remain legal for years to come!    Prior experience: Most of my previous LSA trips have been with crystal LSA extracts, however I made a cold water extraction once, and have eaten plain seeds a handful of times."
115125,Introspective Fractals,Terminally Chill,"Feb 12, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'m 18, ~240lbs and I haven\'t tripped in a while so I ordered some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds  really not expecting much. I read articles of people just being dissapointed after taking 3 or 5 seeds. They came in the mail and there were 37 seeds total of which I ate 15. I am very experienced with LSD and MDMA just as a side note.     I did not prepare them in any way I just put 15 seeds in my mouth chewed until they were pulp, held in my mouth for 5 minutes and swallowed. The following happened. (I fasted about 18 hours before dosing)    8:17pm: I swallow the seeds, they taste like sunflower seeds and leave a very slight bitter taste in my mouth. No immediate effects.    9:28: I feel giddy, like a little kid. No visual effects but I feel buzzed and excited. I played video games and talked with people from my old high school and had some laughs. I decided to make a sandwich and eat it. Which was a BAD idea.    10:30pm: I join a voice chat with very good friends of mine. The visuals begin. I look at my wall and the streaks of paint are vibrating and multiplying. I look at my bed sheets and they look like the mandelbrot set and it blows my mind. My fuzzy blanket looks like it\'s covered in eyes of all different sizes. This goes on for several hours and I just roll around on my bed. My finger tips feel like they are covered in slime.    1:00am: I decide to raise my arm in the air and I drop it on my face. I broke my glasses. This is the point where things seemed like they started going downhill. The visuals and colors are INTENSE and I start crying thinking how much of a piece of shit I am. I ask one of my good friends to stay talking to me and he does.     I had not cried in so long, I just felt numb to emotions and I didn\'t even realize it. My room was messy and had been messy for a while. I just thought about why the fuck is it so hard for me to get motivated to do anything. I began thinking of my past and struggle of sleeping in parks and Laundromats and almost freezing to death in the winter. I began to feel like the struggle of my life had been wasted on somebody that would learn nothing from it. I begin to think about money and why having it is so godamn important in this world. I cry a lot.     2:19am: I throw up. There are no seeds in the vomit just the sandwich from earlier. I begin to regret eating the seeds. And then I look up at the mosaic on my bathroom wall and it was flowing like water. The plain white wall above it is exploding with color and it\'s covered in diamond shaped fractals. I drag my hand across the wall and it leaves a wake like a boat cutting through water. All the times I had done LSD I could never manipulate visual distortions like this before. It distracts me from my own mind for a good bit.       2:30am: I go back and forth from the restroom because I would leave and feel like throwing up again. I eventually make it back to my room and cry some more.      At the time it felt like a bad thing but it was so healing to cry after not expressing emotions for almost a year. I remember that my mother texted my saying she got a job at a heart surgery place as a receptionist and that her old boss split from the company and wants to partner with her. This just turns the trip around. I start to feel like God has our back. I just feel embraced with good. Things are going to change and I will change for the better.      I prick my finger by accident with a guitar string and there\'s blood, I just stare at it and it got bigger and bigger until it looked like a grid-covered cone enveloping my face. It was small so there was no danger.      3:00am-6:00am: I talk to my friend about all the crazy shit I did in high school. I am just dumbfounded on what the fuck I was thinking when I did the stupid shit I did.     My friend tells me something that made me feel really good. He told me that before he knew me, whoever he talked to in high school knew me in some way and that everybody loved me. This took me by surprise because I only had two real friends in high school and 2,000 kids attended my school. He said that people were just drawn to me. Which explains why I have had so many interesting conversations and adventures with strangers that would just walk up to me. This feeds my ego and I realize it, but I think ""what am I without my ego. Just an empty shell."" I had not felt good about myself in a very long time.      My friend says he can\'t stay up any more and leaves, I understood of course and I was very grateful that he stayed at all. The effects are wearing off after all.       I go to sleep with a big smile on my face.      INTROSPECTIVE PART: These seeds reminded me that I am so lucky to have had a rough life. They healed me through tears and made me realize that certain things are in my control and certain things aren\'t. And if I ever worry about something that I should ask myself if I as an individual can change it, and if I can\'t, then I stop worrying.      The next day I cleaned and mopped my entire house just thinking of the look on my mom\'s face when she comes home. I had never been so motivated to do that.      NEXT DAY AFTER GLOW: When I type on my phone or read subtitles they warp around a lot. They look like a red and white 3D effect without the 3D glasses. I am writing this exactly 24 hours after I fell asleep. And the letters are moving a small bit.    Closing Thoughts: I am very happy with this experience. The visuals were incredibly intense and I felt like Mother Nature herself was hugging me and saying everything was going to be ok and giving me advice. As if she guided me to take these seeds after I had shut out the spiritual world for so long. I feel reunited.     However I didn\'t feel stupid and helpless like I do with LSD. I felt I could think pretty clear and speak clearly. No thought loops or anything of the sort. I felt no nausea or headaches I just threw up that\'s all.      Overall good experience and I would definitely do it again. BE SAFE out there guys. Much love."
91527,Pleasurable but Exhausted Me,Alice,"Jan 19, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"Pleasurable Experience but Exhausted Me    I ordered these seeds from an online vendor. My partner had taken 10 seeds the day before after a much smaller (3) and ineffective dose a few days before that. He described a mild, yet enjoyable and peaceful experience with increased sensitivity to touch and sounds. In comparison with several other experiences of people who had taken this dose, we decided that it was quite likely that these were low grade seeds.    ---------  I have severe and crippling anxiety issues and had been out into the town centre to get some jobs done before this experience. Due to this I was quite shaky, teary and low in energy. My partner and I had also been bickering quite a bit over unimportant things.    I was in my flat with my partner present as a sitter. I had eaten a small lunch about an hour and a half beforehand.    The night before, I had crushed 7 seeds up as much as possible. Then I emptied a teabag, putting the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose powder inside and tying the top up with string. I placed this in about 400ml of cold water and covered with some cloth. This was left for 16 hours. I\'d decided to take 7 seeds. Although my partner experienced mild effects with ten, I had taken into account my small size and mental health issues.    When I decided to ingest this liquid (around 3:50pm) I squeezed the teabag with the seeds in to attempt to get as much LSA into the glass as possible. The teabag had a mucus-like substance in it which I presume was the LSA. I drunk it down quickly, it had a slightly scented taste which I didn\'t enjoy much but was bearable.    I sat down and started on a crossword. I felt a mild nausea and unsettled stomach about 10-15 minutes in but this quickly settled.    About an hour passed and I noticed very few other changes, though my surroundings did feel very slightly dream like.    An hour and a half in I had very achy arms and legs and felt my muscles relax. I realised just how stiff and tense my body usually is; my shoulders and back felt much freer. I realised just how stiff and tense my body usually is; my shoulders and back felt much freer. I grew very tired. At this point I was cooking our evening meal and noticed poor concentration (although I do have existing concentration problems that get worse with my anxiety level). My feet and hands felt quite hot and itchy, and I was feeling a bit impatient whist making the food. I probably shouldn\'t have been cooking on the stove in my state, to be on the safe side; although I did manage ok. I had moderately shaky hands.    I asked my partner to serve the food and collapsed on the bed. We then sat down to eat and watched \'Phoenix Nights\'. I was only half watching the episode. I felt relaxed in my mind; very pensive and at ease. I could understand some things about my current situation that I hadn\'t thought about in that way before. And I felt a strong feeling of love and acceptance for everyone- even my landlord! This felt like the peak of my experience. There was no change in visual perception, no hallucinations or alterations in the way I heard sound or felt things.    But a feeling of tiredness had grown and grown and my body was very weak. After I\'d eaten I collapsed on the bed again. I wanted to be able to get up but I couldn\'t even put a film on. I lay there physically exhausted and fell asleep.    I woke up about half an hour later. The peaceful and happy feelings had decreased, although I felt ok in my mind. I was still very sleepy. After lying there awake for 45 minutes I managed to get up to have a glass of water and hoover up quickly. But this was hard and I  back on the bed. I didn\'t want to go back to sleep but I felt like I was being dragged back into it, I was so weak.    This reminded me of the exhaustion I felt on the psychiatric drug risperidone, but without the other torturous effects that I experienced on that drug.    After another hour or so lying on the bed, I managed to get into the shower, and had a long wash. It was nearly midnight by this point. I got out of the shower and had perked up a lot. This felt like the end of all effects caused by the LSA for me.     Overall this was a mild, pleasant experience but the incredible exhaustion it caused me means I don\'t think I would do it again.  I am interested though in what visuals and mindsets I may have experienced on a higher dose."
109238,Staring Into the Abyss,PsychoSemantics,"Jan 18, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"Year of Experience: 5  Previous Experiences: LSD, Psilocybin, O2S, Cannabis, DMT, Salvia, MDMA  Similar Experience: Morning Glories    <!-- Let me start of by saying that if you are interested in trying HBWR, only do so with the proper preparation of mind and body. -->LSA, like any other drug, is not to be underestimated.    Now, it wasnt until very recently (About a month and a half ago) that I happened upon the revelation that these mystery seeds contained a mind altering substance. Needless to say, it got me very excited to try them out; especially considering how hard (and I cannot stress the word enough) it is to find hallucinogens where I live.     After many hours scouring web-sites to buy from I finally found one that seemed semi-decent and dropped the $13 for 100 seeds (This site claimed they were Hawaiian strain). They arrived about a week later along with a nice free sample of some skullcap. I verified their appearance from reports and photos online and deduced that these were in fact what I was looking for. Unfortunately for me, I was going to be making quite a big move in a few weeks after receiving so I had to wait and let my anticipation eat me alive. For storage, I had them in a glass mason jar with the bag itself wrapped in aluminum foil and set a few silica gel packets in with them.    Time passed and the move went perfectly and my job transferred seamlessly, everything was working out the way the universe intended and the time finally arrived to take a much needed spiritual vacation on my first two days off.    In terms of preparation I had done a lot of research into different methods, ie. extraction, sublingual, and so on, coming to the conclusion that for my first time I should just eat them as to get a blunt hypothesis of the particular trip in the most natural setting. This way I could inform friends of mine interested in trying it the particular side effects and quality.    I had eaten quite a big dinner about 2 and a half hours earlier consisting of homemade beef and broccoli with steamed rice.    9 PM  Sitting outside on the massive walk around porch hearing a symphony of crickets through the trees. I was alone except for when my girlfriend passed by as she was talking on the phone every now and then. I laid out 3 seeds and began to scrape the outer shell of some of the easier to remove plant matter. I did notice that there was hardly any, if at all, furry spots which I attributed to the sellers removing before shipping. I popped them in my mouth and chewed them for about 5 minutes and swallowed.    9:40 PM  Slight change in mood, when I would focus on my phone colors were much brighter and felt a slight reeling sensation, not uncomfortable. Feeling somewhat sedated. Not at all tripping. Laid out 3 more seeds and popped them in my mouth without scraping at all, chewed for 5 minutes and swallowed.    10:00 PM   I was definitely feeling nauseous but it wasnt unbearable, just discomforting. Took a small hit of cannabis (I hardly smoke, too much anxiety, but a small hit can calm my nerves.) Went and laid down under the stars and felt overall pleasant, could feel gravity pulling me down which was quite nice, but no OEVs or CEVs to note. Still feeling quite sedated.    10:30 PM  The metallic twang I attribute to LSD starts to kick in slightly (feels as if when I move every particle is shifting in its place to reach a new static location, I can closely relate it to what I think of when I have Gallium in my hand and it melts, if that makes sense), I stand up and go inside to check my pupils, no change in size yet. I lay down on the couch and close my eyes which felt absolutely amazing as walking suddenly was a huge chore, CEVs are at a minimal but body load is definitely creeping in. Nausea seems to have dissipated to a low key sensation.    10:4X PM  Time starts to distort heavily, minutes seem like hours. I had not moved in what felt like forever, I might have even taken a nap at some point for a few short minutes, but the intensity of the CEVs was always apparent. Blinding white lights would amplify and wane, images resembling those of particular letters but with some underlying meanings I dont quite recall that I attribute now to my consciousness latent memories. I was utterly lost in my imagination. At some point, nausea reaches an all time high and I open my eyes and sit up to suddenly crash back into reality. The body load made it almost unbearable to stand up when mixed with the melting feeling. Still no OEVs but peripherals were playing tricks on me as well as slight discoloration of certain things in the darkness.    Pupils still unchanged, which I thought was weird considering I was definitely tripping. Walked outside where I noticed cramps in both legs where it meets the hip, it wasnt terrible though, it felt somewhat nice. I sat back under the stars because nausea was giving me somewhat of a panic attack. Heart rate was definitely accelerated, and breathing was quite labored. It was just the beginning of the very slow come up. My tongue was lead.     10:5X PM  Forced projectile vomit after the worst eternity (probably only a couple minutes) spent in hell. Never seen so much come out at that velocity before, but instant gratification was at hand. Nausea instantly replaced with a smily-giggly high. I stand up and appreciate the world around me as I make my way back inside. Only slight tracers and discoloration when eyes open but a whole new world behind them when closed. Walking is somewhat difficult, but comical to experience.    11:XX PM onward  Laying back on the couch feeling absolutely amazing now that the nausea is gone. Closed eyes and got lost in my imagination until around 12:30? when the girlfriend came back inside and went to bed.     12:XX-5:XX?  I was in a completely new horizon, all around me the physical had melted away and I was but floating in a vast darkness, I do not remember visions or colors, or even emotions or feelings. My conscious simply was in a nonexistent plane yet fully aware. First experience of complete disassociation I would have to say, and it was wonderfully magnificent.    I had abrupt sit ups randomly throughout the whole night still feeling trippy until about 6 AM when I was fully able to check a clock or even move more then just laying back down to be released back to that place. In a sense the last few hours of the trip reminded me of salvia, except without the utter fear and paranoia that it instills within me. Definitely will be trying again at a slightly higher dose to see if results can be replicated, but no expectations will be had.    HBWR is definitely a powerful tool, not a party drug. <!-- Please do not attempt to trip in uncomfortable settings or around untrustworthy people. Give yourself space and a good mind set beforehand and remember, You WILL come down eventually.-->"
101015,A Therapeutic Evening,Seflapod,"Jun 5, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I have had several psychedelic experiences; I wouldn\'t say I was a veteran by any means, but when I was younger I enjoyed going with friends to the local outdoor raves (\'bush-doofing\') and I had enjoyed several batches of acid, mushrooms, DMT, DOB and mescaline.     I recently had a very positive experience using HBWR seeds. I had been suffering from serious depression for about 18 months after having to move to a new city to continue my studies. My GF was extremely supportive, but the new sense of isolation from family and friends, along with an inability to obtain part time work, was taking its toll on the both of us. As I am a scientist, I started to collect data on my depressive moods, concerned that I was developing a possible personality disorder. I was experiencing very periodic \'lows\' (what we came to call my \'black dog\' days, borrowing the term from Winston Churchill), the worst of which would have me thinking about death, suicide and the misery of not being able to take that route because of the people who depended on me. I gained weight and stopped taking care of my appearance. I averaged about 4-5 hours sleep every night. I brewed hard liquor at home and drank heavily, mainly because I was unable to obtain weed. It had been a long time since I felt enjoyment in anything I did.    Then we had a week that was more stressful then any we\'d had since moving. Our lease was up, the landlords were raising the rent, and we had about a week to decide to re-sign, or more preferably, find a better place, out of the ghettos and closer to our university. But our half-dozen applications were all turned down and, heads bowed, we had to re-sign. That day, we arrived home just in time to find our neighbouring apartment had just been filled, with an enormous extended family with about 4 screaming kids. My anger and frustration threatened to overwhelm me, and the next day was filled with a reoccuring thought: \'I am a broken man\'. Just that phrase, repeating over and over in my head.    On the way home, I passed a small party-herbs shop, and decided I desperately needed some perspective. I passed a small party-herbs shop, and decided I desperately needed some perspective. I had purchased HBWR seeds from this chain a few years before, and had had a very mild but pleasant trip after eating about 4 seeds. I bought a bag of 10 seeds and went home.    At about 7:00pm, I decided to get started. I used pliers to crush 5 seeds into a fine powder, skins and all. I knew of the nausea-causing glycosides present in the skin, but I have never been greatly effected by nausea and couldn\'t be stuffed getting the skin off. I poured the dust onto a spoonful of the bolognaise we were having for dinner and ate it: not only did the food disguise the taste of the seeds, but the oils of the meat would allow for better absorption in my stomach. After about 10 minutes, I decided that I wanted a strong trip, and a quick  search had me repeating the process on the remaining 5 seeds. Another spoonful of delicious seed-bolognaise, and I was ready to roll.    As I was waiting for the trip to begin, I put on an old episode of Babylon 5 for fun and got comfortable. About half way into the episode I began to feel something. I was very relaxed, and every so often I would feel a shiver of energy run up my spine. I found myself grinning like an idiot at the sensation, and the characters on the screen were taking on a very slight 3 dimensional appearance.     Pretty soon I was sure the trip was about to begin in full, and I wasn\'t really that keen to start it off while watching bad alien special effects. I got up and quickly made up a playlist of psy-trance and trip-hop music, and let it play while I took a hot shower.  Ahh! Bliss! The shower has always been my favourite place to relax and think clearly, and as the music played I automatically began having an internal dialogue with myself, thinking about all the reasons I had been so depressed. I grabbed the loufer and proceeded to scrub myself all over, in an almost ritualistic cleansing. As I did, I came to see that I had been so self-obsessed in my depression, I hadn\'t noticed myself getting buried in what I saw as the trappings of entropy; I had put on weight, I had let my muscle go, I had stopped experiencing new things, I was only concerned in filling the void that I had created when I had left my old life behind.    I got out of the shower, dried, and fumbled in the dark of my bedroom for my most comfortable clothes, an old shirt and fishermens pants that I always wore when I had psychedelics. My tactile senses were enormously magnified. I found the sensation of my bare feet on the carpet was almost ecstatic. I spent about 10 minutes just swaying in the dark to the music, running my hands over the polished timber of my furniture. I was having definite closed-eye visuals at this stage, and as I continued my therapeutic internal dialogue, I watched flashing dragons of colour shoot across my field of vision in time with the music.     At this stage, I realised I was very thirsty, so I went downstairs. Navigating the stairs was a slow process; the bannister was the most intensely textured object I\'d ever held and I didn\'t want to stop running my hands along it. My GF was on the couch playing a video game, and I came and sat with her for a bit. We chatted for a while, and I became fascinated at the intricate latticework of the weave of my shirt. Amazing to consider the huge amount of work that goes into the manufacturing of a simple, cheap piece of clothe; all the individual threads being painstakingly woven together. I almost felt overwhelmed by this thought, and I\'m sure I was babbling about it for a while. Eventually I went back upstairs to the music, to get back to that magic state I was in before coming downstairs, but the moment was over. The first stage of the trip, what I call the \'melt\' stage, was over.    It was about 11:00pm now, and I was feeling quite cold and more than a bit tired. It had been days since I had had proper sleep. I went and curled up on the couch, laying on a pillow between my GF\'s legs. I put my headphones in and closed my eyes, listening to slow, thrumming electronica and watching the closed eye visuals. These were mostly mild light shows; whenever I\'d open my eyes I was startled by the intense sharpness to the edges of shadows, and the lights in the house felt very bright. I lay there for about an hour, dozing, thinking and relaxing. Eventually my GF said she was going to bed, this was about midnight, and I decided I\'d go too, thinking I\'d get back up later if I felt like it. Tucked up under the thick warm blankets, I was comfortable and filled with a strong sense of contentment. We lay next to each other, holding hands like a couple of kids. I felt at peace with much of the things in my life, and knew that I would take steps to work out the things I needed to work out. My thoughts ran slow and long, and the second stage of the trip, the \'dissolve\' stage, was about complete.    I remained awake for hours, in a sort of semi-conscious fugue. I became dimly aware that I could no longer form coherent thoughts; the words in my mind would jumble, and I could see the words in front of me, scattered and out of place. My entire field of vision was full of geometric patterns; small fractal diamonds, pulsating stars, strange mosaics of light. Occasionally I would get up to use the toilet; it was these moments that I would coalese back into my body and briefly realise my disassociative state. This is the final stage of the trip, the \'particle\' stage. Eventually I slipped into unconsciousness.    The next morning at about 8:00am, GF woke me up. I felt very groggy, and of course very tired, but the sense of peace and that things would be alright remained. I felt very groggy, and of course very tired, but the sense of peace and that things would be alright remained. I came downstairs and had a hot cup of herbal tea. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I had a very out-of-character surge of emotion. I found myself crying for the first time in years, great shuddering sobs as I poured out months and months of guilt, grief and regret. GF, puzzled, hugged me quietly until I stopped, and exhausted, I headed back up to bed and slept like a baby.    Since then, life has changed for the better. I allowed myself to mourn and let go of the life I left behind, and to begin rebuilding the man I was. If taken with the right philosophy in mind, psychedelics are excellent therapeutic agents. Before this trip, I was a broken man, my mind filled with cracks and flaws. The stages of the trip; the melt, the dissolve and the particle, are processes that break down a broken mind, and from the granular \'particle\' state of disassociation, the mind can be reforged, whole and strong. <!-- My advice to others considering a healing trip like this would be:   -avoid social situations while on the trip; it should be an internal dialogue with yourself, and the influence of other people, if any, must be fully understanding and supportive.  -have sentimental objects around you that remind you of good things; examples are clothing, good-vibe music, favourite scents or perfumes, etc. Things like photographs of friends should probably be avoided, due to the unpredictable nature of hallucinations.  -avoid mirrors, again due to the unpredictable nature of visuals. Also, a trip should allow you to be your \'residual self-image\', and a mirror can shock you away from this and sometimes give you negative things to fixate upon.    Thanks for reading, and good luck in your own travels.-->"
88614,Unexpected Healing Session,Seedy,"May 13, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"<!-- I want to share with my fellow psychonauts the potential health benefits of the ever enigmatic HBWR.  I see that Erowid lists more \'health problems\' than health benefits, which is unfortunate.  I do not know the exact cause for this, but obviously the cyanide derivative in the seeds must be involved somehow.  I must repeat, as is stated many times in prep. reports, NEVER INGEST THE ACTUAL SEEDS.  -->A water extract is extremely simple without any chemicals needed.  Other extracts are fine, but there is no reason to not perform at least a simple h2o extract.  I never ingest the actual seeds, eating the \'mush\' will not amplify the trip. <!--  You will want to die from the lipids and poisons.  Please heed this advice.-->    Quick preparation description: 15 or 16 Hawaiian strain HBWR (mailed from Hawaii even!) were ground in a coffee grinder after being soaked in water 3-4 hours.  The water soak was to help remove the outer fuzzy/funky layer.  I know that it is yet inconclusive if the bad junk is on this outer fuzzy layer, but I\'d rather not take chances.    The seed silt was not extremely finely ground, but it was fairly well powderized.  I placed this powder in filtered water (was concerned there would still be chlorine present, but this didn\'t seem to be problematic), with about 10% per volume lemon juice.  I shook the solution every 5-6 hours, and this was left to sit for 24 hours.  It smelled odd, and I was concerned it may have spoiled, but I\'m pretty sure that was not the case.    After one day, solution was filtered through a large sieve, then filtered twice with coffee filters to make sure NO seed remnants were in the solution.  It was late by then, about 2am.  Little did I know what a long night/morning this was about to be.  Solution was imbibed with humble prayer and a mix of iced tea.  However, I still do not think this was ritualized enough.  One really needs to be in a \'separate space\' and purified to properly imbibe the sacraments, IMO.    Within minutes, I felt agony beyond agony in my stomach.  It truly felt like my insides were being ripped apart.  I need to add some background here, which relates to the Health Benefits of Hbwr.  For the past months, I\'ve had stomach problems.  It may be candida or some kind of stomach fungus, I\'m not exactly sure.  I\'m probably lactose intolerant now.  It\'s got to the point where I vomit once or twice a week just from eating food that my stomach cannot handle - and not excessive amounts either.  This has greatly concerned me as my stomach never felt \'right,\' but always felt at least a little off, even when eating healthy and taking probiotics etc.  I do take DXM once or twice a month and have for quite a while, and I think this contributed to messing up my stomach.    Back to the stomach agony.  I was outside in the snow trying to purge.  No matter how much I tried nothing came out.  <!-- This seems to be a shared experience from what I\'ve seen in other reports.-->  I suddenly felt this intuition / voice:  \'You\'re not in control.\'  Nope - now the seed was!  The lack of control scares some, but we all need to relinquish control at times.  So I just surrendered to the HBWR\'s spirit and flow.    About 10 minutes later, after pacing franticly in pain, it was time to purge.  And I am talking Ayahuasca La Purga level purging here.  MY GOOD GODS.  This was perhaps one of the most profound cathartic releases of my life.  When the vomit came out - and it was barely anything, just a tiny amount of water from the extract - the vomit came from the BOTTOM OF MY TOES to the very top of my head.  Every cell of my body heaved with this purge.  And the sound was terrifying.  it was a groan of such depth and mind-shattering agony that was not from myself!  I was \'possessed\' and this sound was no longer my own voice, but some kind of primeval sound from millions of years ago.  The groan went on for 30-40 seconds, and it reverberated with my stomach with a shattering pain.  This was not just physical release.  It was psychic, emotional, spiritual and physical - all in one, as there is no separation among these. It was psychic, emotional, spiritual and physical - all in one, as there is no separation among these.  The purging continued, to the point in which I was crying in ecstatic surrender.  Unbelievably powerful.  Not only that, I could actually feel the seeds/purging \'scan\' my stomach deep down into my intestines - it was looking for something!!  The purging continued and I could feel the entire universe in the vomiting - the karma of the universe was flowing through and flowed right out with each purge.  BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!    After the release, I felt so light that I could have floated away.  This seems common to ayahuasca journeys, but I haven\'t read about it much in seed reports.      The unexpected part was not only did my stomach feel better - it felt AMAZING!  I mean, it hasn\'t felt that way in months or longer.  Whatever fungus or pH imbalance etc plagued my stomach was no longer there!  I couldn\'t believe it.  Maybe there are anti-parasite/anti-virus/etc. properties in the seeds.  I\'m not sure.  All I know is that the intelligence within this seed KNEW I had to release something deep within my stomach, maybe even intestines, and it went right for it, though I thought I\'d die in pain during the process.    And I\'m very glad for that! Throughout that day, my stomach would bubble and make weird noises.  One time while drinking water (extremely dehydrated after the death-purge), I felt more bubbles and actually sensed my stomach lining regenerate!  This is true medicine.  For the rest of the day, this feeling of calm and balance in my stomach continued, which improved my mood in general.    Days later, my stomach still feels fantastic.  I take it easy with my diet, but my digestion actually works now and is efficient, instead of feeling sick after almost every meal I eat.  I won\'t get into the other entheogenic details of the journey... it was not a totally mind-shattering dose for me in terms of that, but was still very edifying and humbling.  I want to stress, instead, the physical/psychic/emotional and spiritual benefits contained within this mysterious seed.  Though it can poison some, in this case, it removed my poison."
84793,Unpleasant Psychedelic,wizard of az,"Apr 18, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Mirtazapine,"I have used HB woodrose twice.  I have decided to abandon this drug, at least for now, due to the heavy physical effects (nausea!!) and lack of psychedelic reward (although there was some).  Despite the general success of my first experience, the second exposure left me nauseous for 24 hours Despite the general success of my first experience, the second exposure left me nauseous for 24 hours, and screwed up my GI function for a few days afterwards, and so I will move on to other, hopefully better, psychedelics (RCs).      Important: Crushing the seeds thoroughly seems to induce more nausea at first, but kept me from being nauseous for like a day afterwards.     FIRST EXPERIENCE  Before I start, I would like to emphasize that I was taking mirtazapine daily (30mg/night, at this time) for depression (mostly).  This affected my experience.  One hour after taking the mirtazapine (I had ingested the HB woodrose a couple hours earlier), I started tripping (no visuals, just the mental/emotional effects).  It completely turned my experience around.    Time of experience: 2010 March 12-13 (Friday-Saturday), 20:00-03:00  Place: College, my dorm, mostly in my room  Acute exposure: 10 HB Woodrose seeds (approx. 1 gram), mostly sanded, chewed thoroughly  Chronic exposure: Mirtazapine 30mg/day, taken at night, at 22:00 on night of experience    I became sick about 30 minutes after ingestion.  I felt very ill.  I tried to vomit, but couldn\'t.  I seriously thought I might die.  I even inhaled some alkyl nitrite to treat possible cyanide (cyanogenic glycosides) poisoning.  I also produced FEROCIOUS gas.  Not very much of it, but the smell was appalling.  The nausea was the worst though.  In addition, I experienced heavy vasoconstriction, which made my limbs very sore; painful to bend.  Walking was difficult.  I took my daily mirtazapine (30mg) at 22:00 (t+2h).  Mirtazapine is a powerful antiemetic.  I think it may have helped with the nausea somewhat, but more importantly, it catalyzed a wonderful and productive experience.      The euphoria hit at 23;00 (t+3h).  At this point, I suddenly knew I was going to be ok.  I was moving around a bit, preparing to attempt sleep.  Maybe this helped. Over the next few hours, I wrote several pages of prose about the world, and then I focused on myself.  I enjoyed psychedelic understanding, empathy, and emotional perfection (although an anxiety chain reaction almost occurred when I paid a little too much attention to the continuing nausea, but I kept my cool).  This <!-- is a place all people should experience, but I would recommend a different psychedelic; this one-->psychedelic is difficult to deal with, and very unpleasant in a lot of ways (nausea, vasoconstriction, gas, etc.)  I learned a lot, and I think I have benefited significantly from the experience via a change in perspective and association of intense feelings of understanding with things I knew but somehow could not understand (like, \'work hard now, you\'ll be happy later\').  I am depressed now (hence the mirtazapine), and no matter what I do, whether I work hard or not, I will be miserable.  But perhaps 10 years from now I will be neurochemically capable of happiness.  I should spend my time preparing for that, rather than trying to experience happiness right now.  I understood things like this.  The potential benefits of this state are unfathomable.  I had a great afterglow the next day, too (peace, serenity, empathy).    The second experience falls clearly into the realm of absolute shit.  I was on 15mg of mirtazapine daily at this point.  This time, I simply bit down on the seeds (after sanding them), and then swallowed them with water (00:00 [midnight]).  The human stomach can\'t deal with this sort of material, but if it\'s crushed up nice and fine, it\'ll just go through you.  It took my GI system days to clean out the seed chunks (I actually saw pieces of seed amongst my feces).  Anyways, at first I got mild psychedelia, but three hours later, the nausea had begun.  I went to bed nauseous (at 03:00, t+3h).  I woke up at 05:00 and puked what was in my stomach.  It came out my nose, and was very acidic.  Awful.  I was sick for all the next day.  I won\'t be repeating this, at least, not for many years.    <!-- The morals of the story:     -when ingesting random plant matter, crush it up good and fine.     -legal drugs are usually legal because they suck.  Feds won\'t let us have too much fun.-->"
87710,Bed Time Inspiration,FrostyBee,"Apr 17, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I am a 22 year old Male. Currently a student. Previous drug experience: Weed, E,  2c-b, Mescaline, H.B. Woodrose, Ketamine, Dxm and various stimulants.    Recently I have been experiencing some rough times in my life. Not due to external circumstances, but due to destructive thought processes which have sent me spiralling out of control emotionally. After having experienced a rough few weeks of being severely depressed I was on the mend emotionally but looking for a little extra help to get me back on top of life.     I then happened across a trip report in which the user had taken two H.B Woodrose seeds before going to bed, had a good nights sleep and reported an elevated mood the next day. The idea of taking a low dose before bed and falling asleep intrigued me. The idea of taking a low dose before bed and falling asleep intrigued me. The reason being that the value I have received from psychedelics has come from consciously working through my problems, the idea of being unconscious while the Woodrose was working its magic seemed counter-productive. I had however experienced one of my most profound trips on H.B Woodrose, it proved extremely effective in helping with my depression (something I directly attribute to my trip) and this latest bout is the first time in a long time I have experienced depression. So needless to say I believe quite strongly in the healing power of Woodrose.    Anyway I decided to go ahead with the two H.B Woodrose before bed. I had some seeds which had been in my room for a long while now due to the fact a Woodrose trip can be quite the test of will and I had not felt the need to take any until my most recent bout of depression. So at 10:30 I was feeling quite relaxed and ready for bed. I chewed up the two seeds and then lay in bed. I had a little trouble falling asleep (quite normal for me) so decided to listen to music. Had been half an hour and was quite convinced I was not experiencing any effects. However after listening to music for a while I began feeling a subtle hint of the beautiful warm euphoria experienced with higher doses of H.B Woodrose trips (quite convinced this was not placebo, I was very sceptical I would experience effects myself due to my two previous Woodrose trips being 10 seeds). I then drifted quite easily off to sleep.    My sleep was undisturbed and the next day I awoke feeling refreshed and energized. Quite a contrast to how I have been feeling the last few weeks. The rest of my day carried along in much the same positive manner. I felt as though I had improved clarity of thought in my lectures that day and life in general seemed much less of a burden than usual. Overall I consider the experiment a success and one which I may possibly repeat in the future."
91901,Burning Fiercely at the Edge of the Void....,quantagy,"Jul 30, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"I recently purchased 10 grams of seeds from a reliable online vendor, and had the opportunity to have my first experience with them this past weekend. My wife and 2 year old daughter left early in the morning for a two day trip to Maine, and I had the house to myself for the first time all year. I spent the early morning cleaning the house and getting my space prepared, as well as packing a travel bag in case I decided to go for a walk, since the sun was shining brightly and appeared to be the start of a beautiful day.    My attitude from the start was one of positivity, curiosity, and slight apprehension. My history with psychedelics is extensive, however Im never so sure of myself to forego opening night jitters, particularly with a brand new substance. After much self-debate around dose and method (was considering going sublingual to avoid nausea), I decided finally to approach the plant seeds head on and hard: I ground up 13 seeds in a coffee grounder (theyd been pre-scraped and untreated), and mixed them in a small glass of Mango-Orange juice. Down the hatch\x85.    9:15: Dosed.    10:15: Nothing so far. Aware of my mind searching for changes within itself.     10:45: Thoughts seem to be slippery, as though my consciousness is a wet plane of glass and its contents sliding around. Thoughts seem to be slippery, as though my consciousness is a wet plane of glass and its contents sliding around. However, everything else feels normal. Pupils not dilated whatsoever. As Im waiting I am working on an illustration.     11:15: Finding it difficult to draw. Aware that I am grinding my teeth pretty bad, so I get up to get some gum. The gum is not in the drawer where I thought I left it. So I check the bedroom, where I decide to make the bed. This only gets half done before Ive started organizing the top of my dresser, and then wondering where the cord to my razor went and then thinking about why not play some music, so head back into the living room only to remember there IS music playing. So I sit down and try to draw again but realize Im grinding my teeth really bad so maybe I should get some gum. The gum is not in the drawer where I thought\x85.(Okay, so you get the idea at this point where Im at\x85)    11:30: Finally just sit and acknowledge that I am COMING UP FAST. Restless energy is bubbling up from my knees, and I decide I need to take a short walk outside to have a cigarette. This idea occurs as I am staring at my half finished drawing, and I wonder if the idea to take a smoke break originated in my head or from the designs on the paper (Did I begin this drawing two months ago to deliver, via symbols, this message to myself now to go for a walk and have a cigarette right now at this moment?) I now realize Im going to trip good and hard, and so grab my smokes and head out the door.    11:35-12:15: Smoking on the corner. Colors of the sky, trees, street, cars, asphalt, grass, you name it, exceedingly vivid and glossed over with a subtle, soft, waving pattern reminiscent of LSD. In fact, I can suddenly access detailed memories from my last acid trips back in college, over 12 years ago. Aware also of my brain attempting feverishly to organize and categorize this experience, and even plan out the rest of my day. Then waves of resignation wash over and I realize I need to just let go and stop trying to manipulate the energies of the come up and of the trip itself. Finish a second cigarette and feel extremely lethargic, and a little nauseous. Head back to the house.     12:20-2:00: Zonked on the couch. Difficult to sit up or move for any length of time. OEV are minimal, essentially anything I look at appears to be breathing, and covered in a slippery soft aura of energy. But CEV are prominent and profound! A whole host of iconic imagery (pyramids, arches, spiral seashell structures from beyond and within my consciousness, multi-faceted mirrors like reflecting jewels, catching images of my thoughts and shining them back to me and to each other, only to rotate and shine imagery from beyond and within back to my watching inner eye. Also during this period I begin to experience my ego not as a solid idea, but like one of those cartoon flip books where as you thumb the pages images appear to move. I felt my sense of self as a series of impossibly thin films that simply get run in succession to perpetuate the illusion of me. Accompanying this insight is my first real shot of stomach discomfort, and I feel I need to vomit. I pull myself off the couch and into the bathroom.    2:00-2:15ish: I cant get myself to throw up. I keep telling myself that if I do Ill feel better, and just to get the sick out of me. This last phrase suddenly strikes me as the issue at hand: Ultimately it is not the seeds making me need to vomit, its my deeply ingrained belief that there is something sick and wrong inside of me. And the only way to get rid of it is to punish myself through the discomfort of vomiting. Its about feeling dirty and sick and needing to punish myself, and I do it to myself every day in a hundred different ways Im never fully conscious of. My belief that there is something wrong with me is the only thing thats wrong with me. This hits me right between the eyes like a fucking hammer and like that *snap* the nausea is gone. I pop up from the porcelain god, feeling like a million dollars. Full of energy, and ready for another walk.     2:20-4:00: I grab my bag and head out the door. On one hand I feel renewed, stemming from my toilet bowl revelation, but on the other hand Im now tripping harder than I have in some time, and feel as though Im only barely holding onto to myself, especially as I walk into the town square. My plan is to stop by the local grocer to get some fruit (parched, need vitamins) and then head into the arboretum. I get to the store, grab a pear and a nectarine, and head to the cashier. Suddenly, from the customer service counter I hear: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TRYING TO GET AWAY WITH?!?    Though I cant be sure, I think I may have jumped 13 feet in the air. I look over to see this African American woman suddenly pitching the mother of all fits to the customer service girl.    <!-- Dont think Im gonna let you take my fucking money! Who the fuck, I say who the FUCK do you think you are? Ill come back here with the fucking cops motherfucker dont think you can play me like that with my FUCKING MONEY!    -->I stood there, fruit in hand, and literally felt assaulted by the swamp-like morass of negative, harmful aggressive energy that was pouring from his woman out into the checkout area (this is a small grocer store, FYI, not a large supermarket). Equally tangible was the frozen, electrically charged anxiety pulsing out from the other cashiers. The angry woman raged on, meanwhile the young girl ringing me out couldnt seem to remember the price of the fruit or how to use the register. Finally she figured it all out. I said thank you and quickly got my ass out what felt like some pit of utter consumer despair.     Twenty minutes later I was in the arboretum. Though the day was gorgeous, and the folks walking around nothing but pleasant, I felt I was still wearing the negative energy from the grocery store. I couldnt even eat the fruit Id brought. I tried sketching, but each line I drew would begin to twist and breath and speak to me some insight about my own psyche. I sat back against the tree, and suddenly felt beyond exhaustion. I couldnt even lift my hand to grab a cigarette or my water bottle. Sweat began pouring down my face and the back of my neck, and the leg cramping common with woodrose seeds was now prominent. A host of negative thoughts took hold: those seeds were poison, youre gonna die out here, you need to vomit up the sick in you again, etc.     I found, however, I was able to access the rational thinking part of my brain. I told myself to remember to breath, and once I was breathing the path towards feeling better became clear. I reminded myself I took a heavy dose of a drug, that there was much tripping still to come, and it would be best if I were at home and comfortable. Get up. Drink the rest of your water. Put on your headphones and listen to upbeat music and get the fuck home.    All this was done successfully. I chose to listen to Phish from Hartford of last summer, Tweezer, remembering at the show my best friend bouncing around the crowd on mushrooms. Suddenly I was bouncing my way back home, wearing a grin so strong that I couldnt have wiped it off my face if there was a gun to my head.    Upon reaching home, I was struck with my own externalization of the archetype of pilgrimage. The going out in order to access a place of spiritual well being within. I stripped off my clothes and drew a warm soapy bath, and threw on some Jerry Garcia Band and soaked for about an hour.      4:00-5:30 : Out of the tub and back on the couch. OEV are now even more prominent, every surface of my house is shimmering, moving, and conforming to what I believe are ancient, syntactical patterns that organize the illusion of matter. I suddenly feel overwhelmed, and that I need to mellow out. I smoke a bowl of cannabis and put on a baseball game. This combination does the much needed trick of giving my brain a little dose of normalcy. Its a welcomed reprieve.     5:30 -6:00 THE PEAK: I turn off the TV and pick up Robert Anton Wilsons The Illuminatus Trilogy, which Im about halfway through. I cannot accurately describe what happens to me while reading this book. The text which up to that point has been frustrating me for about a month, suddenly reveals its topological manifold and I able to see the message, rather than read it, not unlike one of those magic eye posters that were popular in the mid-90s. Thats all Im going to say about that book. It induced within me a genuine psychotic episode (complete with audio hallucinations) that lasted about 20 minutes and left me paralyzed (physically and cognitively) on my couch. I closed my eyes and felt my existence burning fiercely and eternally on the edge of the void. I felt that I could choose death at the moment, and that the trick of it would be to trust in LOVE and simply let go. I suddenly understood how someone could make a dreadful mistake under this kind of influence. I suddenly understood how someone could make a dreadful mistake under this kind of influence. I called up images of my family, and of my beautiful daughter, and this opened up within my center a wellspring of aching beauty and naked joy for my own existence.     6-9:30: Coming down now, though there is no return to my normal brain. I feel rejuvenated and neurologically and spiritually reprogrammed. I spend the rest of the night pleasantly stoned in bed drinking ice water and listening to the Psychedelic Salon Podcast.     Following Morning: A blissful afterglow that doesnt quit. As I write this its two days later and Im still floating, loving myself for the first time in far too long.    Two <!-- recommendations for others trying woodrose for the first time-->takeaways:    -Being in a quiet and flexible environment. My needs on this plant changed rapidly and dramatically.  -Despite the intensity of the trip I was never at a loss to access rational cause and effect common sense thinking. And when I did it gelled well with the experience and helped to move things along. Immerse yourself in the mystery, but keep Reason close at your side.    Peace, Cheers, and Good Good Good Vibrations\x85.."
112361,Dark Emotions & Visual Thinking,SJB,"Oct 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Time: Summer, 18:55, warm weather and clear sky     Location: Fields in the countryside, my shared flat    Insertion method: oral mucosa (sublingual) + later: oral (swallowed)  Mindset: Eager, but a bit troubled (a period of many changes ahead and I am putting many things behind) I had been planning to do this trip for several weeks now, but decided this was the day. I am on my own.    + 0:00 I \'sublingually\' ingest 17 seeds of crushed and blended HBW seeds, after dissolving them for 15 minutes in a quarter shot of cold water.  Trying to spread the shreds of seed and liquid throughout my mouth, it is filling up with spittle quickly, which I do not swallow. I finish a little bit of housework and prepare the stuff I want to take out with me later. I try to meditate for a while, but I am not very calm.    + 0:55 I spit out and collect the HBWS-saliva in a storage jar with slices of garlic and ginger, which I take with me, and leave the house to go for a bicycle ride into the nearby countryside. I can already feel a very slight decline of coordination, my reaction time seems normal, my mind slowly starts running a bit \'hotter\', the psychedelic swamp of HBW/LSA starts to rise.    + 1:10 I pick up an apple that dropped on the road right in front of me: It is not perfectly ripe, but tastes surprisingly sweet, the texture is thick and the chewing noises sound amplified. I arrive at my destination for now: A scythed hay field surrounded by low trees on top of a hill, where I had been many times before. I have a nice view of the flat broad valley and surrounding hillsides settled with villages and covered with farmland, groves and the city farther away. The landscape seems barren, the summer has been very dry, much of the grain has been collected and dust rises from working farm machinery in the distance.     +1:30 (Sunset) I decide to raise the dosage: I feel the oral mucosa absorption does not reach the intended intensity - I try to recall it felt like <5 seeds swallowed at that time - I have a bit of auditory effects (amplified and everything is \'grating\' more), very weak visual effects, except for seemingly sharpened sight into the distance and the beautiful red sun seems quite large sinking behind the horizon, I feel the very typical bit of body slackness, and my mind is a little muddy and agitated, but not upset.  So I drank ~ 66,6% of the seed & saliva liquid avoiding shreds, lay down and put on some music. Vapour trails are a good way for me to tell visual distortions, but they seem quite normal.    +1:40 A bit of nausea comes up  it is not painful or too distracting for now. I constantly drink some mild black tea.    +1:50 - +2:10 As I expected I start to review many bad emotions, I appreciate the chance to face and follow them while trying to not get too attached to them - the \'weary\' and slightly nauseous body feeling adds to this throughout the trip. I often write while tripping and take notes from now on.    I feel bad about the setting, it is in the countryside but neither very \'natural\' nor calm. I like the city and the area, but I review how I never really got to settle down here  I have friends in this place, but no genuinely close emotional relationships  and want to leave it behind me. I am going to leave the city soon and have been looking forward to this for a long while. I would like to be able to share this experience with my close friends, yet I am also glad to be on my own and solitary. I think about the positive bodyload of shrooms and the more clear and analytic mind that other (prohibited) substances allow me to have. At times there is no analytic introspection, it is hard to see clear thoughts, it is instead a swamp of emotions. At times there is no analytic introspection, it is hard to see clear thoughts, it is instead a swamp of emotions. I feel very empty for a while like there is nothing to find inside. Yet after that it was like having found the door to a black and red underground tank of negativity.     +2:10 - +3:00 It is getting dark and a little cold. I start to wander around again, then pick up my bike and slowly head back. I feel disconnected from the world. Two days earlier I met a friend I had not really talked to in ages and I never really felt a close connection to her, but she had to talk to somebody as the frame of her life had largely fallen apart lately (relationship, job, partly her social relations) in very unfortunate circumstances  I realise how I was understanding and trying to help her through analysis and advice, but how I wasn\'t deeply empathetic. Thoughts about a former girlfriend I had a loose long-distance relationship with, which I had stopped to pursue several months ago, start to appear. I felt the grief I thought I had inflicted on her, though no guilt or regret. I almost cried for a few times over all the bad, though not trying to subdue it really. At the same time I appreciate all that I am and have in my privileged life, and relate to all the suffering that people experience everywhere on earth. During all this time negative thoughts are very prevalent, I accept them, but they never \'take over\' me and I remain aware of my altered state.    I give up my initial plan to take a bath in a nearby lake on the way back as I feel unsettled and sluggish. I take short breaks on the ride back over empty cart tracks closing my eyes and observing the bodyload and emotional pain. I feel like I want to dance away the misery, feel ironically escapist, but I am to weary anyway. Straight running car headlights seem interesting in the distance as all \'artificial\' and very regular shapes do. There are no tracers and visual distortions are weak in the dimly moonlit light.    +3:00 I get home trying to avoid bumping into my flatmates. I light an incense stick, lie down on my bed in the darkness and switch from instrumental ambient to more lively music. My breathing feels very flat, quite arduous and I sometimes think I had just stopped, but I stay calm and breathe deeply. Voices from outdoors sound shrill and echoey. My sense of self is very diluted, boundaries between I and other vanish. I like to pursue ego dissolution and relish the feelings of how my categories of thought and language disintegrate. With lights on shapes are a bit flowing and breathing, close things seem enlarged and detailed.    +4:15 I get up, eat some sweetened yoghurt and drink some fresh tea I manage to brew, the taste is crisp and delicious, however my senses feel dull. The artificial light in the litchen is dirty bright and yellow. I meet my flatmate whose laughter is unbearably loud, but luckily he leaves me alone. After that I am getting more and more unable to get myself coordinated and stand up. LSA and LSD strongly heighten my sense of order, but I can hardly get myself to tidy up the clothes I dropped in my room. I lie down again, philosophise, think about the practice of buddhist teaching and attachment. I think about the way in which our lives have been digitalised. I feel a sense of impending doom for the future of humanity, how our technological and social dynamics exceed any mechanism of control, which people still long for and try to achieve in many ways. I realise how myself and all people are afraid of powerlessness and uncertainty. My body feels intensely yet pleasantly like it is all chewing gum.    +5:00 Trying to continue my log, occasionally writing down some thoughts, I cannot figure out how long I have been tripping. 3, 4 or 7 hours... My generally very \'accurate\' sense of time is gone. From then on I am mostly wriggling on my bed to the beat of the music, half-comatose my swamp of a mind is draining slowly, leaving behind an abstract, visual inner world of faces and organic shapes and I have some interesting asymmetric closed-eye visuals (all typical for me on HBWS).    +6:30 I need to pee, but on the short way to the toilet my circulatory system and enforced body control weaken dramatically on the short way to the toilet my circulatory system and enforced body control weaken dramatically. I defecate while trying not to fall down from the loo. I then collapse onto the cold floor, pulling a towel underneath me. I get up and vomit twice. I crawl into the shower and sober up for a while.    +7:00 I feel purged inside-out, quite serene in fact, get some milk to drink and fall asleep almost instantly.    + 13:30 Next morning, I wake up by myself way earlier than usual. My body feels warmer than usual, I breath in some sweet summer morning air, feel very calm and quite energetic, although not yet entirely clear again.    Resume:    Method: The absorption via the mouth / oral mucosa, which I had tried in lower doses before, does not really work well for me. Compared to eating the seeds in my experience the dosing would have to be 3x the amount or more with up to an hour of keeping them in, instead of as low as 1,5x which some reports mention.    Trip: I had been anticipating doing this. I expected it to turn emotional and a bit dark, albeit for slightly other reasons (but some of those HBW has already made me face before) so I embraced that side of the trip and did at no point during or after the trip regret it  the dark periods serve to me as a way of properly dealing with negative situations and behaviour, and the mindset as a glimpse into a state of depression or mental illness, that I hope helps me relate and empathise more. I expected some nausea after drinking the liquid +1:30, however it hit me surprisingly hard in the end  I never had to vomit on a psychedelic trip before even with swallowed HBWS. The weariness and quasi-paralysation on higher-range doses is a side-effect that I do not enjoy very much.    These seeds work on a more intuitive and emotional level for me than other psychedelics These seeds work on a more intuitive and emotional level for me than other psychedelics, they can go very deep and be useful in that regard! When compared to mentally similarly \'impactful\' doses of e.g. psychedelic mushrooms auditory effects on HBWS are moderately strong, music is less strongly enhanced and (especially open eye) visuals less pronounced, while touch and taste seem slightly and smell hardly altered."
112272,"A Marvelous, Joyful, Encouraging Journey",lucky57,"Sep 1, 2018",Amanitas - A. muscaria & H.B. Woodrose,"If it matters, am 6\'6\' (height-weight proportionate).  Took these substances at home by myself at 4:20 p.m. Mountain Daylight Savings Time on August 11, 2018. This instance was the first time I\'d ever taken any sort of mushroom. Had read that keeping the dosage low is a good idea on the first try. Had taken Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds before in combination with Morning Glory seeds with somewhat unsatisfactory results (nausea, lack of intensity). My mindset was extremely relaxed in the matter; felt quite confident about what I was doing and that nothing would happen that I couldn\'t handle psychologically. Had read that having a \'sitter,\' at least on the first try, was a good idea; but I consider myself a very stable person, and one who\'s endured a couple of so-called \'bad trips\' along with some very traumatic experiences in life. Having survived them all and being in my 60s, didn\'t feel prone to any sort of psychological breakdown.    Didn\'t wish to take on empty stomach; felt that might lead to nausea. Had tried various preparation methods with Morning Glory seeds, all of which were taken on an empty stomach with the experience of nearly intolerable nausea. About 90 min prior to ingestion of the caps and seeds, ate a turkey and cheese sandwich with a little mustard - and a little caffeine-free diet Coca-Cola.     I tore off small pieces of the mushroom and chewed each carefully - didn\'t taste bad, sort of earthy, musky. Took all four seeds at once and chewed them, left them under my tongue for a minute, then swallowed them. I then took two dimenhydrinate (NOT diphenhydramine - benadryl) anti-nausea tablets and ate a clementine orange since I\'d heard that acidic fluids help to potentiate the alkaloids in the mushrooms and seeds. After about 1\'45\', I took a booster dose of 1/2 a cap of Amanita Muscaria + 2 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.     After about 2\'30\' - 2\'45\', began to experience mild closed-eye visions. Like sitting on a big outdoor balcony with a 180\xb0 view of the aurora borealis. Gradually the visions became more intense, much more colorful, and much more complex, with constantly-changing abstract patterns. It was like watching multiple movie screens at once, being able to pay attention to all of them at once and note what was happening in each of them. Sometimes all of the screens would meld to form one image - occasionally figures or faces which I thought of as being \'grotesque,\' \'menacing,\' or \'perverse;\' a little bit intimidating at first, I knew that resisting these figures or trying to run from them would intensify the slight anxiety I felt at first. So I willingly accepted them and thought of them as being my friends rather than my enemies - this caused me to smile. I thought of my smile as moving through space under a strobe light, like a river of undulating smiles, which made me smile all the harder. I began to feel joy at knowing that I was under the influence and so much in control. I conceived of reaching out to touch the visions and extended my arm upwards above my body while lying on my back (this was about 4\'30\' after the initial dose). It was as if I\'d dived right into the middle of all these marvelously-colored patterns and pieces of jewel-like light sources. They were inside of me now, making me feel happy, secure, and warm. They filled me up and I exploded into a thousand whirling multi-colored galaxies, all sending off sparks of light; yet even though I\'d exploded, I could stand and watch myself as a separate observer, even though I\'d experienced that sensation of filling up and so joyfully exploding.     The galaxies reconvened to reconstitute my self and suddenly I conceived of a spectacular light source that began rapidly entering my body and exiting, back and forth, going faster and faster; at times it seemed to be vacillating inside and outside of my body and at other times, I was vacillating inside and outside of it, then both were happening at the same time. When written in black-and-white on paper, it doesn\'t quite make sense; the sense of space and time were more fluid. It kept going faster and faster and, as the frequency rose, I was able to hear a sound that rose in pitch to match the frequency. At last the light and I were completely one and then we began twirling and rotating through an ocean of colors. Our form changed constantly and would encompass the normal size of my body to perhaps a hundred square miles, back and forth.     Throughout all this, I am aware of the constant process of change, renewal, and acceptance of the rapidity with which it was all happening. So much was happening in such a short time that time seemed to slow down. At this point I thought to myself, \'I think I\'m pretty-much peaking about now,\' which caused another huge smile and a sense of joy and satisfaction. I thought to myself, \'I think I\'m pretty-much peaking about now,\' which caused another huge smile and a sense of joy and satisfaction. The fact that I was actually able to enjoy a hallucinogenic experience (especially after my rather strict upbringing) made me very pleased. It had been about five hours since I took the first dose of mushrooms and seeds. I conceived that something sacred and other-worldly had entered me and that I had entered it - some magisterial, majestic force that was making me lose my own identity - my self - repeatedly, over and over. For some reason it seemed natural to me to find my self over and over again and to identify with it.     As time passed, I became weary of it and it dawned on me that, perhaps, I was being called upon by this force to relinquish possession of my self - to let go; perhaps even to die. While the same visions of colors and vibration and frequencies were right in front of me and inside of me, it was as if I had a separate dream about riding a horse out in the country. I came to a wide and beautiful crystal-clear stream where my horse drank. A very handsome elderly man with white hair and a big, thick, long, white beard rode up on his own beautiful white horse on the other side of the stream. His black eyes sparkled, and he smiled broadly at me with his deeply-creased face, instantly winning my trust. He slowly crossed over to my side of the stream, holding my eyes with his steady gaze and smile. \'Ride with me,\' he said. \'You\'ll see, it\'ll be beautiful.\' With only slight hesitation, I began to ride with him and it was now as is if I had a trail-pardner, someone I could trust in and rely upon. The wonderful visions continued, only now I had someone to share them with, and that made me very happy. It dawned upon me that I had given myself up to death, and it was wonderful! Never had I been happier or felt more satisfied or complete. It was so reassuring to think that \'this is what death is like.\' Thinking of death as a friend, a companion, a trail-pardner - was such a refreshing thought for me.    7\'00\' after the initial dose, the visions began to weaken and my thoughts became less compelling. Around the 8\'00\' mark the last few flickers of color in my vision slipped away. Lay awake for an additional four hours, unable to sleep, and around the 12\'00\' mark, I finally drifted off to sleep (around 4:30 a.m. the next day). Had some fairly routine, unremarkable dreams. Plan to take the drugs earlier in the day next time so I won\'t be up all night again.  Plan to take the drugs earlier in the day next time so I won\'t be up all night again. Slept until 1 in the afternoon, felt very mildly \'hungover\' (nothing nearly as bad as a bad alcohol hangover).    Also of note is that the mushrooms and seeds had a fairly rapid laxative effect - after three hours, I had a large bowel movement rapidly followed by another liquid bowel movement. It was an extremely satisfying experience, giving me several whole-body shivers, almost like having an orgasm. It almost made me laugh to think that it was similar to what a woman must feel when giving birth. While squattin on the bog, got totally ensconced in watching some light patterns on the bathroom wall for a few minutes - made me laugh when I realized what I was doing, sitting there with a wad of toilet paper in my hand and a dirty bum.    All in all, a fantastic, rewarding, and growing experience. Up until four years ago, I hadn\'t done any hallucinogens since the mid-1970s as a late teen / early 20s lad. At that time, there was still a terrible stigma attached to it - at least in my mind. I took LSD once under really poor circumstances and had a really bad time. Mescaline was more fun. About four years ago I took Morning Glory seeds (and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds) several times with somewhat unsatisfactory results and, after trying to figure out how obtain illegal substances, recently heard about Amanita Muscaria mushrooms and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Got the mushrooms <!--on e-Bay and the seeds on Amazon-->online. Think there may be some risk to ordering the mushrooms (seems to be questionable legality to owning the dried version of the mushrooms), but nothing happened with it this time at all. <!--So if you try it, do go easy first time round and if you have any doubt about your ability to handle \'heavy stuff,\' have someone available to help you just in case you need it.->   Best of luck to all!"
83094,"Nice Trip, Bad Side Effects",Charleysez,"Aug 26, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I had a mixed experience with HBW, I have done acid a few times (which has made me feel sick at times) and mushrooms and I had done the Trip-E capsules once before which contain HBW mixed with some other ingredients (these also gave me mild nausea).     I decided to try HBW as I have stopped taking chemicals in favour of natural highs. I read up on them thoroughly before taking them as I was aware they contain toxic substances. I cannot have alcohol so the traditional Hawaiian method of soaking them in alcohol was out of the question. I also could not get any coffee filters so soaking them and drinking the water was not an option. I decided the best option was to scrape the coating off the seeds as thoroughly as possible and to smash them up with a mortar and pestle and put them in capsules. This was a method I had read on a website which seemed to be pretty well informed.     My boyfriend and I took them when we were in the queue outside the new year\'s eve party (I did 2 capsules he did 1 to start with). We started to feel a bit queasy by the time we got in to the party which must have been about 40 mins, this passed fairly quickly and I felt very positive about taking them. The party was excellent and had a friendly crowd and good atmosphere for a hallucinogenic experience.     The seeds were a nice gentle ascent up unlike acid which tends to just hit all of a sudden and can be quite aggressive. I began to feel very euphoric and danced for a while and got some mild visual effects. So far so good! My partner wasn\'t feeling much so he took another one.     I made the mistake of eating a square of dark chocolate which did not go down well and gave me stomach ache. This was not too bad and after a bit we went into another room - I started getting more trippy visuals and felt very peaceful and free and couldn\'t stop smiling. Then my body started feeling more and more weak and floppy until I thought I was going to pass out. I lay on the floor before I collapsed and felt very heavy and relaxed - so much so I was struggling to remember to breathe and kept closing my eyes. I managed to tell my boyfriend how I felt and he was wonderful and kept talking to me to make sure I stayed awake. After a while I managed to get up but all night after that I kept getting weak and sleepy and passing out I kept getting weak and sleepy and passing out, I couldn\'t stand up for a lot of the night and started feeling sick and getting stomach cramps.     I hadn\'t eaten for about 4 hours before taking them because I heard it was best to take them on an empty stomach. This made being sick impossible as there was nothing in my stomach. I did throw up some acidy stuff but still felt bad. My stomach bloated up and my hands and legs felt achey and tingly all night. Despite this I still felt in a relaxed and happy mood and did not panic. I am grateful I was in good hands though because if it wasn\'t for my partner looking after me constantly I may have lost consciousness and people may not have realised.     I felt like I needed the toilet but couldn\'t go and the sickness and fainting feelings kept alternating and in the end I decided it was best to go home. I knew it could be potentially bad news but I did not feel scared or paranoid. I was feeling in control mentally although still a bit trippy and I managed to get home (half asleep all the way!).     When we got in I went to the toilet and was a bit constipated but managed to go - as soon as I managed to get it all out of my system my stomach felt instantly better, I felt dizzy and weak still but was able to breathe properly now and had a gingko biloba tea and went to bed to sleep it off. I slept on and off all day and felt a lot better after especially once I\'d eaten something. I had a large spaghetti bolognese and some biscuits as I felt the need for something sweet.     I knew HBW could cause vascular constriction  but I only found this out after purchasing them. In hind site I really shouldn\'t have done them as I already suffer from Raynaud\'s Syndrome I already suffer from Raynaud\'s Syndrome and poor circulation, but I had decided the chances of this was probably fairly unlikely - wrong! <!--Ok I was lucky enough not to get gout but -->I did have some unpleasant feelings in my hands, legs and feet all night and all the next day. Once the vascular constriction wore off I had the opposite problem and my hands, legs and feet swelled up really big and got bright red and really hot! To counter this I smoked a joint which instantly took it back down. My nose was running and eyes watering and I felt like my body was trying to expel the poisons in every way possible.     My boyfriend was fine all night and he does have a stronger stomach than me so I guess it really depends on the person. I really enjoyed the high but will not be doing them again in a hurry. I would advise anyone thinking of taking them to try a small dose first, wait a few hours and see how you feel before doing more - they are slow to take effect. <!--Also DO NOT do them if you have circulation problems / history of fainting / sensitive digestive system! -->They brought my new years eve to a halt far too early.<!-- and are potentially quite dangerous! RESPECT THESE SEEDS! Also I guess this is why only the poorer Hawaiians take them - they are too risky!!!-->"
74253,Realized I Was Seriously Tripping,Verin,"Jun 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"A Powerful Legal Psychedelic    This was my first experience with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, but not my first with LSA (I have used Morning Glory before).  I am a fairly experienced user of psychedelics, having done LSA, Salvia, Mushrooms, and of course a bit of marijuana before.  I am by no means an expert, however, and I am now beginning to learn how they work in my body and what I can expect from different types of chemicals (such as the difference between lysergic acid compounds and tryptamines).      I ordered the HBW seeds online from a vendor that sold two types  normal HBW seeds, and HBW Super Strain that supposedly contain about 3 times the normal amount of alkaloids.  I purchased 10 seeds of each variety and when they arrived, stored them in a cool, dark closet.  My friend and I were to do the seeds together on a weekend where we had nothing else planned.  We did them alone as I felt we would be fine without a sitter.  I had not eaten in six hours, and my friend had not eaten in ~4 I believe.    T+ 0:00  We decide to eat the Super Strain variety  4 each.  <!--This would probably be equivalent to eating 12 normal seeds.-->  To prepare the seeds, we soaked the seeds in a cup of water for about 20 minutes, and then used a knife and our fingers to peel off the furry outer shell.  We attempted to peel the inner brown shell off of the white core, but it was fairly difficult and we just decided to eat them as they were.  We ate them whole, and chewed them for a minute, letting them soak in our mouths, before swallowing.  We immediately ate ice cream (Chocotacos) to get the taste out of our mouths.  The taste itself wasnt so horrible at first, but after 20 seconds or so it started to taste pretty detestable.      T+ 0:15  My friend and I were starting to feel our stomachs rumbling already.  He got really bad nausea, while mine was just a subtle discomfort.  I was extremely surprised to already get that feeling of coming up after such a short time. I was extremely surprised to already get that feeling of coming up after such a short time.  Colors were noticeably brighter, and there was a strange feeling of lightness in my muscles, with a hint of relaxation.  This was definitely a good method of consumption, as other people have described up to a 2 or 3 hour delay before coming up.  We decided to go outside to see if fresh air helped, and also to have a good place to vomit if need be.    T+ 0:20  My friend had to vomit, and regretted losing the Chocotaco he had eaten.  I wandered back into the woods next to my house a little bit and looked up to see a very startling sight.  The intertwining tree branches contrasted on the bright night sky was extremely mesmerizing.  I felt I had to vomit, but only ended up dry heaving.  I told my friend to come back, as he was feeling better after vomiting and we stared at the trees for a few minutes before going back inside to a room where we could be ourselves and just listen to music.    T+ 0:35  My stomach got progressively worse until I threw up in the toilet.  The vomit wasnt entirely unpleasant, as immediately after expulsion I felt a lot lighter and better.  Most people report trying to find ways to consume the seeds without this, but for me it was more like a rite of passage.  Now the real trip could begin.  My muscles were starting to feel very relaxed.  Every sensation felt very natural  I could find complete comfort in walking around or just laying down.  I decided to lay down on the floor while we listened to some music.  My friend reported feeling very heavy when he was standing up, but very light when he lay down.  I began to get the familiar feeling (familiar from when I was on mushrooms) of melding into the floor.  I spread out to receive as much contact with the rug, which began to feel very sensuous on my face and skin.      T+ 1:00  We decided to listen to the band Godspeed You! Black Emperor as they have such emotionally powerful songs, and we were really starting to get into the \x91tripping mindset.  I played the song Storm and began to feel wonderfully loving towards everything.  I thought about my life and how I affect the people around me.  I had entered the very satisfied state of living in the now, and as the song reached its climax, I began to cry to myself in the dark in complete awe of the power of music and the beauty of the world I live in.  As the song came to a close, I stopped crying and realized I was seriously tripping.  We discussed the wonder of life, and different philosophies as we listened to more soothing, mellow music.  We had the lights off, and my mom came in to deliver some cake to us.  I declined, but my friend decided to eat a piece or two.  Even though I knew I hadnt eaten in a long time, food just didnt sound appealing.  Having her walk in was very sobering  as if the room we were in was a secret universe of infinite possibility, but she had brought a little bit of the real world in with her.  As she left, we immediately got back to tripping.  It was very easy to act normal, however, and we werent freaked out or paranoid about having her around.      T+ 1:30  We have been in our own personal worlds of thought with little visual effects, because we had been sitting in the dark with just the iTunes visualization screen to light the room.  We decided to turn on the lights and found it to be a very different world we were experiencing.  Colors were very much more defined, and everything looked new and wonderful.  I let my cat in and we discussed how animals live such simple and wonderful lives without the desire for material goods.  The feeling of the cat\'s fur was amazing, and I felt like I could feel each individual hair as I ran my hand over his back.  Everything had such a unique feeling.  Physical sensations are enhanced many times over, and I felt the need to touch everything.  My friend and I sat and explored our own faces for 10 minutes alone.  We both felt very uninhibited, and I decided to follow my cat around and try to smell all the things he can smell.  I crawled around on all fours until I got up and started to walk around and feel all the walls and surfaces I could find.  I began to do what I call the Eagle Dance that is so associated with Native Americans.  I am normally not the type of person to do anything like this in front of other people, but it just felt very natural, and I didnt care who knew what I was doing.      T+ 2:30  We both play guitar, and decided to give it a try in this state.  We turned off the lights again and attempted to play along with the music.  Neither of us had any kind of coordination, and our attempts consisted mostly of playing the same note over again, or barely keeping up with very simple bass lines.  Even so, it sounded very beautiful in our state, and we enjoyed it immensely.  Eventually I left him to his guitar and took off my jacket in search of something with more color.  I decided on another sweatshirt, and came back and tried to get online and talk to a friend on an instant messenger program.  The keyboard felt really alien, and it felt completely strange to talk without being able to express emotion like I wanted to it felt completely strange to talk without being able to express emotion like I wanted to.  Quickly I decided I couldnt do it properly, and decided to get off of the computer, but not before telling the person that I loved them immensely.  This is a very emotional drug.  I felt like I loved everything in the universe, and that I was connected to everything.  We continued listening to music and writhing on the floor and generally making fools of ourselves into the night.    T+ 4:00  This is probably the end of the mental part of this trip. We are both getting pretty tired and drained.  We decided to go downstairs (my mom had gone to sleep by now) and watch TV or something.  We were still feeling very physically affected.  The same sensation of absolute pleasure in anything was still present.  I found myself instead of watching TV (couldnt follow any programs for the life of me) walking around the living room and climbing up and down the stairs just for the pleasure of doing something.  This was contrasted with periods of supreme relaxation on the couch.  I tried to do everything in a strange way, and decided that sitting on the couch ought to be done upside down.  This inevitably led to me getting stuck on the floor between the couch and a table, but my friend helped me out of that.  My friend eventually fell asleep on the couch, while I kept walking around and trying to decide on something to eat.  It really took me an hour to decide, as my mind was racing a million miles a minute, and I felt the need to immediately walk around as soon as I tried to sit and look in the refrigerator.  I ended up making some canned soup and eating it without a spoon.  I found that if I stood still, I would just drift into different physical contortions.  It wasnt scary, but I often ended up on the floor with my legs or neck in some strange angle.     T+ 5:30 - I eventually settled down on the couch and watched Adult Swim for a while before turning it off and lying down in bed.  I hadnt noticed many of the visuals associated with psychedelics before now, and laying in the dark I saw a kaleidoscope of colors shattering and reforming into geometric patterns made up of triangles.  Even though my mind was still racing, and my muscles were a bit sore and twitchy, I found it very nice to lie down and do nothing after this day.  It did take me a long time to fall asleep, but when I did, it was a dreamless darkness.      I woke up early in the morning feeling completely rejuvenated.  I had a little muscle soreness, but the good kind that just feels wonderful to stretch out.  No other physical side effects.  I had a very nice relaxed afterglow for the rest of the day.      This was an amazing experience.  I am completely satisfied with every aspect of it.  The physical sensations are a lot like what I imagine ecstasy is like, the emotional aspect was great and led me to a deep sense of caring for all my friends and family, and the trippy aspect was present as well with everything looking changed, new, and bright, and even some closed eye visuals.<!--  If its hard to find mushrooms or anything where youre at, I would definitely recommend HBW.  -->As always though, be careful people.

91092,Memoirs of a Space Cat a Night With Infinity,Gnosis Space Cat,"Mar 16, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'ve heard of LSD acting as a mind enhancing drug, but its close cousin LSA? It would appear as though LSA has some secrets of its own.    I have drank cold water extractions of Morning Glory before (it tasted like bitter peanut butter... There could be a market in this) and chewed the bitter seeds of the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, at times close to thirty, with not much effect. So wasn\'t I surprised when I chewed only eleven seeds and found myself in the grip of maddening euphoria for hours on end. My comrade and I each chewed eleven seeds or so and decided to walk around the town and peruse the book store for anarchist literature, Terence McKenna, Walter Benjamin, Allen Ginsberg, and numerous books on psychedelic drugs (It\'s a nice thing when your local book store has all of this).    Hours passed, we had been off baseline since a half hour or less after we chewed the seeds. The mild euphoria, we thought, was as high as we were going to get... But with each passing second it subtly intensified. My friend suffered from slight nausea, I had a little myself (as is common with these seeds), we decided to walk the three or four miles to my house because it was getting on the later side of the afternoon. We began to talk, starting with social commentary, and ending up reminiscing over our public television childhoods. We walked passed a house, that of course we logically assumed belonged to a wizard and a family of gnomes, and another. We came upon a house that was white, and awful, and satellite dished, and evil, and wrong, unholy, just bad. It made my friend sick to his stomach. Our talks of our childhoods became even more impassioned, we took a shortcut through a neighborhood of condos and quickly found ourselves scurrying into the woods. My friend took refuge in between the roots of a tree and wouldn\'t get up for fifteen minutes or more, I patiently talked with him and admired all the nature that was out that day.    As we got closer to my house, I felt as if I was flashing back on Salvia Divinorum, my arms stretched down as heavy rubber while my bike slowly sank into the pavement. The sidewalk was a treadmill, my head was lighter than hydrogen gas. We finally made it to my house, my other friend called me on my cell phone as I walked through the threshold, and I couldn\'t contain myself. My body became the physical manifestation of laughter, much to the bewilderment of my friend on the phone. I explained to him that I was \'Tr-tr-tri-Tripping so hard right now\'... He decided to call me back at another time. So me and my fellow psychonaut sat in the fading light of the day and ranted and raved, still stuck on social commentary. I remember exuberantly speaking the awe I held for the eyes of a girl I know, because her pupils were always dilated \'That is so cool! I always wanted to really express that!\'. I had photo-grainy visuals though out the experience, including, eye patterns, snake patterns, blue dots, and cube zippers.    Then my friend and I began to talk metaphysics, like never before. Now, I already had known that LSA affects the way you perceive time, but it was never so intense that each minute was as an hour. I stumbled into the bathroom, each step was an orgasm for my foot (I later found out that LSA increases appreciation of sensual and aesthetic sensation). I snapped on the lights and beheld my face in the mirror, pupils dilated like saucers and in the process of making minute adjustments to their size, resulting in pupil fluctuation. Proportions made little sense to me as I stood laughing into the mirror, my nose was huge! I yelled to my friend \'There is no difference between a psychoactive and a non psychoactive substance... My teeth are DMT crystals!\' as I grabbed my teeth. This is where everything got intense, I felt a small wave of nausea mounting. There was a buzzing approaching me from the middle of my head, I became increasingly lightheaded. I nearly vomited, but my body decided against it. The buzzing intensified, as did the light headedness. My vision went brown, I was on the verge of fainting, I flipped the lights on and off and saw no distinct difference. My vision went brown, I was on the verge of fainting, I flipped the lights on and off and saw no distinct difference. I began to explain to my friend that my trip had taken an interesting turn, my voice sounded like a far off megaphone. I stumbled down the hallway and into my room onto my bed, on which I laid until the buzzing subsided. My Euphoria returned tenfold, as did my clearheadedness, I was a super genius again. Unfortunately my friend\'s nausea worsened, and he vomited in the toilet several times and was sick and miserable for the rest of the night. Neither of us got much sleep, I drank some Kava tea and employed the aid of some homeopathic stress relief to relax me. But my brain was on overdrive, I kept expanding on the points I had discussed earlier. Several times I mistook my thoughts for reality and essentially dreamed while I was awake (or maybe I was lucid dreaming that I was awake and knew that I was dreaming while awake in my bed). Eventually I found a niche in my mind that could go to sleep, while the rest of my head continued to buzz. Eventually I found a niche in my mind that could go to sleep, while the rest of my head continued to buzz. It was very relaxing, we always try to keep track of our thoughts and it takes more effort than we realize, if you can sleep while your thoughts flow you enter state of mental serenity. When I woke up, well I\'m not sure when I woke up since I was half lucid the entire night, I was still mildly tripping. My friend was still sick and he eventually got a ride home, and I biked to my school and had the most fantastic time taking SAT. My thoughts flowed so clearly and lucidly, I was still euphoric and having a good time.      However, this trip wasn\'t just novel, it was one of the most spiritual experiences of my life... Here are some of the ideas that I remember: The collective unconscious is the biological internet. Think of a brain as a computer; alone it can do much, but it only reaches its full potential when its connected to other computers through the internet. The reason why the internet seems so foreign yet so familiar is because the internet is already hardwired into all life as the collective unconscious. When we \'created\' the internet out of non-organic materials and signals, we were only reflecting what we already knew unconsciously. This also essentially reinforces the idea that, not only humans, but all lifeforms are social animals to some degree, motivated and influenced socially through the biological internet. It\'s the perfect balance between the individual and the collective, like the political philosophy of anarchist communism, which is in all likelihood another reflection of what we already knew unconsciously. I also realized that dreaming is like a social networking mega-site, since dreaming is the entrance into the collective unconscious and therefore the biological internet, each dream is one social networking site shared by all life. (New hypothesis: Given enough time, the internet would become an indistinguishable extension of reality).    I also learned that the multiverse is is indeed wove from language as the shamans say it is. A good example is the Om symbol. One of the things Om symbolizes is the vibration that is the multiverse. I was thinking of the nature of language, when I realized that language is a vibration that you form with your mouth into shapes of sound, as well as the alteration of its tone and frequency. Sound familiar? It should if you know anything about string theory. In string theory the multiverse is made up of one-dimensional strings that can stretch themselves into two dimensions and store compact dimensions in closed strings (rings). String theorists began to realize that what made the strings perform specific actions was the rate and frequency of which these strings vibrated. Even at absolute zero there is a vibration known as the \'quantum jitters\'. Heres where it gets real interesting... The holographic principle states that the multiverse is comprised of two-dimensional universes, but in order to store its bits of information efficiently, the individual universe stores the information in voxels and projects itself into three dimensions of space. We are simultaneously a physical reality and a hologram, a digital program and an organic being.    People always attempt to solve paradoxes, what they don\'t realize is that the paradox is the nature of reality. There is no end and there is no beginning, the big bang is the growth of a cell to fill up (non)space (which is altogether a different kind of space). It\'s like counting numbers with numbers, it doesn\'t end, you can go forever in all directions. So, just as the macro reflects the micro (as with an atom and a solar system), all universes make up a multiverse and a multiverse is just a universe in an even larger multiverse out to infinitum in all directions. When a universe dies it dissolves back into the collective unconscious of the infinite supra-multiverse. Just like when an organic being dies on a planet, its physical body breaks down and adopts a new form (the multiverse is its own food). Or if a planet or star decays and its material goes on to create new planets and stars."
86185,Peace and Well-Being,CCKat,"Dec 27, 2017",H. B. Woodrose,"First off, I\'ve tried HBW once before and had a horrible experience with it from the amount of nausea I felt. This time, I took some precautions in pre-making a large amount of chamomile and mint tea the day before to chill in the fridge and taking ginger root pills right before hand. This worked very effectively and kept away all nausea this time.    So I chewed four cleaned seeds at 11:30. An hour later I couldn\'t keep awake (likely more due to the fact that I hadn\'t slept well at all for the last number of days rather than a side effect), and dozed pleasantly in and out until about 2:30. There were only mild effects by then, and I thought perhaps the seeds were duds. By 3:30 though, the full effects finally hit and it was incredibly similar to lower doses of LSD; no hallucinations or visuals but incredible feeling of peace and giddy well-being, like the first time I ever fell in love.     I tried watching a movie but got bored very quickly, and the same with a usually well enjoyed MMO. I then tried sitting outside, which was indeed a great setting visually, however I live in a southern climate and 90 degrees with 80% humidity was just too uncomfortable to bear, even in the shade. So I retreated back inside and channel surfed for a while, finally coming on some cartoons which were very satisfying. Whether it was the bright colors, plucky music, or overly silly characters and storylines, it was exactly what I was looking for. (Looking back, I think it was likely because I was experiencing some time distortion -- it felt like time was moving slower/more time was passing than it actually was. So it seemed like the movie and game were just progressing too slowly to be entertaining. Whereas, the faster storylines of cartoons made for children\'s short attention spans seemed to be moving at the right pace.)    I ended up hogging on all kinds of things in the house, not because I was particularly hungry or had munchies like with marijuana, but because food simply tasted amazing. Marshmallow cookies, bbq ribs, strawberries, curry rice, the chamomile/peppermint tea, chocolate soy milk, it was all extraordinary. The only thing I ended up not liking was a Sprite that just tasted like pure chemicals. I was glad to have a bunch of varying tastes on hand.    As for the actual effects, throughout the trip I would randomly burst into bouts of exuberant laughter for no reason whatsoever. I also kept catching myself with a huge grin plastered on my face; so much so that by the end of the day, my cheeks were sore. Like with LSD, despite the large amounts of stress I had in my life at the time, during the trip it felt like all was right with the world. That I could just easily let go of all my problems and be at peace. The strongest of these effects tapered off by about 7-8, but I was still feeling very happy when I turned in for an early night (for me) at around 11.    As a side note, I noticed another personal similarity to LSD - it gave me cold-like symptoms: a stuffy nose, sore palate, and slight lung congestion. Next time, I will definitely take a mild decongestant and see if that solves the problem or if it\'s a psychosomatic response.    Overall though, it was an extremely pleasant experience that bolsters my thoughts of experimenting with higher doses. Especially, since HBW seeds are much cheaper and easier to come by than actual LSD.    -----------  Note\'s from the next day:    I slept in this morning and feel very lethargic, no drive to get up and do anything whatsoever, which is unusual for me. There\'s a comfortable heaviness to my limbs that makes me just want to laze around in bed. I have noticed a slight light sensitivity; no pain, but in bright light my eyes seems to unfocus and I feel like I just can\'t see properly. Also have a mild sinus headache; again, not painful, just pressure in the sinus areas. Otherwise my lungs and sinuses have completely cleared out and there are no signs of the other cold-like symptoms I had during the trip.    What I\'ve always liked about LSD, and now also seem to find with the HBW, is that it seems to clear out my head\'s cobwebs. Before the trip, I was in a very bad funk -- in a darker place than I should have been whether stressed or not. But afterwards, it feels as if I can deal with my problems with the proper emotional level. In other words, the sense of peace and well-being remains even after the drug has dissipated."
110028,Euphoria and Unexpected Memories,LateAdaptor,"Dec 13, 2017",H.B. Woodrose,"The seeds of woodrose are an interesting drug with some psychedelic potential. However, usage needs some care, and before going this way, <!--you should definitely dismiss some prejudice-->I considered:    1) It is not a party drug.  2) If you take too much, it\'s a poison.  3) Don\'t swallow! No, just don\'t!  4) It is not like LSD.  5) It is not pure LSA.  6) Fun is not guaranteed.    This drug needs quite some preparation. In the paper [1] I read how you should *not* do it. They really did everything wrong what could be done wrong. First rule is: don\'t swallow! <!--If you do, you will experience severe nausea and even have to vomit.--> Here is, how I do it.    4-5 seeds, sugar, cacao, water, and ginger, the secret weapon of the psychonaut.     Clean the seeds of the light brown skin and all white stuff. Break each seed with a pliers, crush it in the mortar. Add a teaspoon of water, some sugar and some cacao. Mix it. Wait 3-4 hours. The result is a dark brown paste, which looks disgusting. And indeed, it is, though softened by the sugar and the cacao.     I put it into my mouth (sublingual), but don\'t swallow! Hold it there for 15-30 minutes (fighting disgust). With the amount of time, I can tune the dosage of ergolines I get. Now I cut thin slices of ginger and make a strong tea of it. After I get rid of the stuff in my mouth, I drink one or two cups of that tea. That helps against the nausea.    Next: patience. It takes quite some time to kick in, 1 or even 2 hours before I feel something. For me it starts with a rising euphoria, very somatic. Sometimes, nausea rises too - then ginger tea! Simultaniously a subtle hypnotic feeling starts. I loose the ability to follow a movie or spoken word. Music on the other hand sounds more beautiful. The body may want to move, and every move feels just so wonderful. Time runs a little slower. The hallucinogenic potency is very low for me. The euphoria may hold for 2 or 3 hours.    Then, however, phase two begins, which I would call the psychedelic phase. The euphoria vanishes quite quickly, and the hypnotic state becomes prominent. Dependent on dosage, that may even feel like a lock-in. I almost completely loose the ability to connect my will with the executive instances. This has quite some potential for anxiety! Simultaniously a lot of memories pop up, very fast, almost as if in a hurry. Many of these memories are from childhood, even early childhood, and I see connections that are very surprising. It is as if threads of memories are unwound, from today back into the past, very very fast, almost too fast to get used to it. I see connections that are very surprising. It is as if threads of memories are unwound, from today back into the past, very very fast, almost too fast to get used to it. In this phase I may even see lights (closed eye hallucinations). But most stuff I see are vivid memories. This second phase does not bring so much fun, but still it has a lot of value for me. I would also call it psycholytic. That again may run for 2 hours, then I\'m just falling asleep.    The next morning I feel quite some headache, but also a good afterglow. I just feel fine. And here it comes: this feel-good period may even last for 2 or 3 weeks! And actually I don\'t do it more often than once a month. Usually I\'m very prone to winter depression. But the seeds make it vanish, instantly. It even made me stop smoking weed because I found the weed rather to deepen depression, and other problems. Does LSA have potential as an antidepressant?    However, this is a plant product, and what you get is not pure LSA, cf. [2]. The way of preparation and administration I described ensures to some extent, I only to get water soluble ingredients of the seeds. Anyways, the dosage per seed is also unsure. If there would be an LSA pill, I would prefer this.    In my country (in Europe) selling seeds for plant breeding is legal, while selling it as a drug is not. Taking it as a drug is legal again, as it is with all drugs, even those, where possession is illegal (which are all interesting ones, of course). How one can take a drug without possessing it - only a lawyer may know! Can one only possess things that are outside of one\'s body? But what if they are inside - and come back?

110932,Wonderful Yet Not Overboard,UncleRemus,"Nov 27, 2017",H.B. Woodrose,"This trip was wonderful! I\'ll walk you through the process of preparations, and try to share my experience.    First, I bought the seeds a month prior to ingesting them, they just sat on my countertop, beckoning to me.  Having tried LSD and Mushrooms about a dozen times in my life (albeit at a younger age),  I was very excited to try these seeds.  But, I\'m a very patient person, so there they sat.  When the time and day seemed to be in sync, I prepared the seeds for ingestion.    Many have said that there is a hairy skin on the exterior of the seeds, I did not find this to be so. I tried peeling them, then soaking for 30 minutes and tried again, yet nothing came off the outside of the seed.  I discarded the notion of peeling the thin shell of the seed, thinking perhaps they had already been peeled or somewhat brushed clean of the skin.  The seeds had been soaking in about an ounce of water in a mortar w/pestle.  Boy these seeds are tough.  Even after a half hour of soaking, crushing the seeds seemed to be somewhat of a challenge.  I did what every handy person would do, and got a pair of needle nose pliers.  After crushing them in those jaws, the finishing crush was no longer a problem.    Time for ingestion, Yeah!! Considering the ounce of water they had been soaking in, and their powdered state, I just added a little milk and down they went.  The taste was not unpleasant, perhaps a little nutty/woody.  I filled the mortar with more milk and swirled it around to get the last of the seeds, and was still stuck with a good thumbnail sized pile of goop.  A spoon soon took care of that.  I didn\'t hold them in my mouth for any period of time for a sub lingual route of entry, trusting in the fact that I hadn\'t eaten for at least 8 hours, and just drank them.    I should mention, that after reading trip reports, I understood that many people became nauseated and vomited somewhere between an hour and two hours after ingestion.  Always the boy scout, and liking to be prepared, I had purchased an anti-emetic (motion sickness pills/anti-nausea) beforehand.  I took one nausea pill 30 minutes prior to ingestion, and another at the time of ingestion.  It did the trick.  I never got sick, nor felt like I needed to throw up.    On to the effects.  Although I have no blood pressure cuff at home, and wouldn\'t know how to test my blood pressure anyway, for the first 1-2 hours, it did feel like my blood pressure was slightly elevated.  It settled down after that, and I really started to relax.  Knowing that I wasn\'t going to get sick, I fixed a large meal of enchiladas with rice, and filled my stomach.    I chose to watch \'Electric Sheep\' videos with dark trance music on my headphones.  <!--Search your favorite search engine for these videos, and you\'ll find them right away.  -->Anyway, the videos are visually amazing, and the trance/industrial music was just what I needed.  I settled in for the long buzz.      The trip began in earnest at the 2 hour mark.  While not as potent as LSD or mushrooms, the body high is pretty close.  I got lost in the music and the video.  While I didn\'t see the carpet bubble, or the walls drip, the colors of everything were definitely, extremely enhanced similar to the more powerful hallucinogens.  After a while, the music and colors (especially on the screen) became a part of me.  I could anticipate every beat of the music with absolute precision.  The external world and I were merged.  What a wonderful feeling. The external world and I were merged.  What a wonderful feeling.    Some trip reports mentioned sleepiness at around the 2 hour mark.  I did not experience this.  At around 4 hours, I closed my eyes, and ate up the music like every beat was a morsel of food from the gods.  This was an extremely audio based trip.  It was also an excellent sensory (touch) trip.  I used my fingers to touch my arms, face and neck, and it felt like I was being touched by electric fingers.  I am always holding onto my vaping device (quit smoking 4 years ago and haven\'t looked back). I was vaping black licorice flavor, and that was very enhanced also.  The vaping tip is practically glued to my lips most of the time, but this time was different.  The tip in my mouth sparked those skin sensations, and I gently ran it around my lips and tongue, it was electric.  The trip lasted a good 10 hours, and I became very sleepy.  Falling asleep was no problem, and was out like a light in 15 minutes.  I will certainly be trying these seeds again.    Time ran very slowly during my trip, which was nice.  Longer for me to enjoy myself.    The very best part of this trip is the body high.  I know that 25 seeds seems like a lot, compared to many other trip reports, but it was great for me.  I like my psychedelics a little on the heavy side, preferring two hits of LSD or a double dose of shrooms at a time.  Because I felt no ill effects from this dosage, I may increase it for future runs.    <!--Like advice given to all psychedelic users in the past,  prepare your space in advance.  Make sure there isn\'t going to be any chaos.  Get a trip sitter if you are nervous about the trip, and for god\'s sake take some anti-nausea pills for this particular substance.  You\'ll be glad you followed this advice.      And, as always, have safe, delicious fun.  Delicious, what a nice word.  I should have been more prepared and had cheesecake available, and lots of it.    Thanks for taking the time to read this trip report.  -->It was a pleasure taking the time to share my experience."
82278,Juggling with Grand Canyon Vision,Johnny Appleseed,"Jul 10, 2017",H.B. Woodrose & Selegeline,"I planned on crushing up the seven seeds and soaking them into a tea to drink Monday morning. However my house was left empty on Saturday night and the biting urge to trip out had me plopping all seven seeds in my mouth. I chewed on them and let my lower gum take in the LSA at 7:00pm. I swallowed the wad 30 minutes later, which triggered my gag reflex.     For the next hour I was reveling in the anticipation of a psychedelic experience. At the hours end I was doubtful it would happen. But I was feeling giddy and a general murky weirdness.     From 8:00 to 9:30 I was not enjoying myself. Being a legal product I began to doubt the seeds recreational potentials and began comparing it to nutmeg (havent tried). I felt I was under a deliriant and had a general poisoned feeling. I thought, this plant prolly doesnt want me eating its potential offspring so its teaching me a lesson to not eat. I smoked a cig.    I retreated to my room to lie on my bed in the dark. My stomache ached and I wanted to sleep. The taste of the seeds was still in my mouth and it became aggravating, yuck. After only a few minutes on my bed I popped up to brush my teeth (a fun activity while tripping, brightenin the bitin bones) Ahh, relief, much improvement. My stomache relaxed and the poisoned feeling went away. I returned down stairs.    I flipped the TV on and looked over at my dog sleeping in the other room, 20 feet away. His head was confusing to look at. I knew I was looking at the head but I couldnt differentiate the various sections. I couldnt tell which was the back and which was the front or where the eyes or ears were. I blinked and tried to shake it off but the illusion wouldnt subsist. Here we go, now thats what Im talking about, I be trippin, not really though. But slowly more psychedelic qualities began building in my head.       While playing Mario Kart Wii I was able to play the game competently with possibly improved performance. What was most interesting while navigating the tracks was my ability to look at any portion of the TV, even at the wall beside the TV, and be able to use my peripheral vision to control my kart. This was the opposite of tunnel vision, I had Grand Canyon Vision, with full focus, 1080p. Also I could put thinking about playing the game to the periphery of my thoughts and still maintain performance. It was like I could play the game well, analyze my game playing abilities and reminisce on what I did yesterday, all in complete euphoric control. I wasnt tripping I was juggling! It seemed very creative the ways I was using my head to concentrate, like I was flexing my brain muscles in ways I never have.  I even tried to play the game off the TVs reflection in the window but it made everything backwards which was too much even for my nimble, savvy, psychedelized head to handle.    I had the stereo playing various albums (The Kinks, Animal Collective, Dan Deacon). Music was good, I was surrounded by it and it was comforting and warm and I was more attuned to the background details of the songs. The lamps around the house had warm feelings also, for some reason I recall the subtle hues of pink and orange being visible.    I wished I wasnt alone, but wasnt disappointed about it. I began thinking about my friends and girls and concluded I could easily express and enjoy myself socially in this condition. I would have been funny goofy and bubbly around people. Man, I wanted sex.     I then paced around my house for a bit at 10:30. These seeds have a more natural feeling. I didnt feel that my thoughts were on razor edge clarity, slicing through endless conceptions like LSD. Mushrooms have a natural feeling, also, but this wasnt exactly the same, closer to acid, for sure, then shrooms. It felt evident the seeds are not a manufactured substance designed to unleash whats within.  I was craving that synthetic edge of acid, I really wanted to go further and if I had more seeds I certainly would have ate at least three more. A way to describe my condition was a psychedelic feeling but not a psychedelic experience. The potential for a bad trip was not possible because I just wasnt that gone, this was light but very nice. Id say I peaked at 11:00.     I got real drowsy and went to bed at 12:30 still tripping. Falling asleep was sort of bothersome, kind of like when the spins from alcohol make concentrating on sleep unbearable. I wished my head would stop tripping and just relax so I could rest. I did fall asleep soon enough though.    Okay, so other experiences with seven seeds have much more dramatic effects and a reputable website lists seven as a common to strong dose. This was not strong and by comparison to other reports barely a common one. Hears the deal, five days prior I stopped taking Selegeline, a selective MAOI. I had been taking 5mg daily for about a week and a half. The effects of the drug last long after ingestion like two weeks I believe. It has been reported Selegeline makes phenethylamines (mescaline,2c-b) more potent. Nothing I can find discusses selegiline and tryptamines (Psilocybin), which I think LSA can be considered. I decided from this experience that effects are diminished. I was expecting to experience far more then what I did even though I enjoyed what did happen.     Months ago I took two grams of mushrooms and truly tripped and I am assuming that 7 seeds should have had a stronger reaction then those 2 grams of shrooms, but thats not reliably known.    Would I try it again and let my friend in on this? I dont know, theres an initial hurdle that I found to last two and a half hours, which are not enjoyable. But then all the murk eventually clears up to experience the cleaner color time. Perhaps I will continue sustaining form selegeline and redose with another seven seeds in the coming weeks and report back."
100635,A Rip in Our World to Another World,Im not sure yet,"Dec 9, 2016","Huasca Brew (Syrian Rue & A. confusa), H.B. Woodrose, Calea zacatechichi, Damiana, & Passion Flower","My First Time Mistakes    This was my very first experience with anything of this sort. Drinking a \'special tea\' to allow me to awaken some spiritual third eye was lost on me. I didn\'t believe it, I didn\'t believe IN it either.     So I asked around, did my homework, spoke with some physicians even, and decided to purchase several leaves and vines to make a special tea (I still did not believe this would work). I bought some damiana and salvia previously, and would boil the contents freely and drink the tea constantly, I was told I would be relaxed and lucid, but I felt no more changed than if I drank regular sleepy time tea.     So I decided to buy some things and PROVE that this ritual and experience was \'BS\' and boy was I wrong.     Ingredients - Syrian Rue 2.3 grams ground but not powdered, passion flower 3 teaspoons shredded, hawaiian acacia confusa root bark 4 teaspoons powdered, hawaiian baby woodrose seeds 12 seeds crushed, Calea Zacatechichi shredded leaf 3 teaspoons, damiana herb leaf shredded 3 teaspoons.     Preparation - ALL ingredients were put together in one steel pot, 1 liter of water, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, just enough heat was placed on it to make it NOT boil. When the water level became low (after 2 hours) I filtered the \'tea\' through a clean shirt, into a clean coffee pot. I put the pulp back into the steel cooking pot. I took the coffee pot and poured the tea through another clean shirt into a second coffee pot. I poured the tea a few more times between the two coffee pots to get rid of all the floating plant remnants. I poured another liter of water and teaspoon of vinegar into the steel cooking pot with the pulp and simmered for two hours and repeated the filtering of the \'tea\'.     5 hours had passed by this time and decided against a third \'wash\'.     Mistake 1. The drinking of the tea- The two initial washes were put into one coffee pot and I poured myself an 8 ounce cup, and then poured one for my wife. We both had a sip from our mugs, it was bitter. We added cream, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla, and the tea tasted like a strong horchata, or vanilla chai latte. That was mistake number one, because it tasted good enough to drink the entire contents all at once.     After about 30 minutes, my wife and I were conversing and then she stopped talking mid sentence. Her eye went wide and tears began rolling down, I was about to asked her what was wrong when the effects of the tea hit me.....      Mistake 2, not being prepared-   There were several effects of the tea.     Visual effects- my eyes had trouble keeping saturation, the best way to describe it is looking at a picture on photoshop or MS paint or some other art program, then taking the \'Hue/Saturation\' bar and dragging it up and down, so then everything goes from greyscale to full on color, and back and forth. Size proportion was difficult to maintain, the background of my wife seemed smaller, then bigger, and my wife\'s head and limbs looked like they were expanding and shrinking, not exaggeratedly, the changes were slight.     The worst part of the visual effects was the pictures on the walls, my wife\'s face and the faces on the television, they became pale, their eyes blugy and white, their mouths looked like they were opening more than they could and a black void could be seen in the back of their throats. Blue veins eminated from the corners of their lips and surrounded their faces. They seemed to come closer to me, like they were coming towards me, out of their frames. The room became brighter, the shadows changed color, from a dark black, to a rusted red, and they elongated.     When I went to my room to lay down I noticed the hallway was contorting, like in charlie and the chocolate factory, when the hallway became small. I also noticed that my eyes were trying to patternize and restructure anything that was organically shaped, like the stucco walls, the clothing on the floor, my eyelids when they were closed, this created a kaleidescope effect that appeared to me like everywhere I looked - the space I was viewing was trying to open a long tunnel, or portal and it looked like I was travelling through it. I tried closing my eyes or shift my focus to avoid that, but it was inevitable. Visually I was travelling, but to nowhere in particular (as I wasn\'t expecting astral travel).     After the initial come up, things settled down, and the second wave came on, and everything looked like they were taking on monstrous forms, the clothing hanging in the closet looked like people, or monsters, trying to come out, the foot stool looked like there was a dead cat on it, and the shadows continued to grow and move with swiftness across the walls.      Physical effects - racing heart, there was a faint burning smell, even though nothing was cooking, nor were there any candles lit. I could hear better, at least it seemed like I could hear everything, perhaps my selective hearing went haywire and decided to stop focusing on the important noise, and simply listening to everything. I could hear the blood pulsing through my eardrums. One of the herbs works as a medicinal treatment for asthma patients, so my bronchial tubes expanded and I took in excess oxygen, resulting in hyperventilation and a tingly feeling in my feet, hands, and eventually, my chest. The hyperventilating and focus on my breathing caused my body to feel paralyzed, immobile, and light as a feather.     Emotional effects - during the initial visual effects, I became frightened as I had no idea what was happening. I thought I accidentally poisoned myself and my wife. I began to fear that we were both on the verge of dying, and that at any moment, my heart would stop, or we would both have seizures or have some type of anuerysm. I began crying and prayed to God (which I don\'t truly believe in.) that She make it out of this alive. When I saw the monstrous hallucinations, I felt like I was taken to another realm, and it was a barrier that I had to break through, much like facing ones fears, in order to begin the journey.     When My eyes began to see the \'portals\' I calmed down, I focused on my breathing, and started doing a fact check \'1. I am still alive, 2. My hands and feet are tingly because I\'m hyperventilating, 3. I have no tell tale signs of imminent death, 4. I have read about this type of experience before, and not to worry.\' When My head felt clear, I enjoyed the travel... It didn\'t feel like I was travelling through space and time to another world on the far reaches of the galaxy, no. It felt more like a rip in our world to another world, slightly similar to ours, but, different. The best way to explain it would be the entire series of \'His Dark Materials\' the golden compass, the subtle knife, and the amber spyglass. More specifically, the subtle knife and the amber spyglass books. They describe a shimmering tear in someone\'s world, that created a window to travel to the other person\'s world. Some worlds were very similar, some were very different, some were even to the land of the dead. I felt that I was able to sense, and somewhat see these other realms for myself, and the people the dwelt within them. There was no sense of anguish, no sense of fear or anger, not even a sense of purpose or drive for either of our existences. I felt there were other beings out their who I could now see, and who could see me, and their question was \'okay, now you see us, we know the other one exists, now what? What great things are we going to accomplish? Can we even accomplish anything great? What knowledge can we exchange that is new to the other one\'s world?\'      Mistake 3. Not believing. Please, if you are reading this, and are a skeptic like I was, I urge you to have a more open mind. DO not come into this with a predetermined notion of what you think will happen, or worse, what you ASSUME others lie about. A skeptics mind will cause a negative reaction. I urge you - not to believe in this, but believe that other people believe in this, that my testimony can change your heart and mind, just a little bit, to allow yourself to open up and prepare. PREPARE! Yes, do your research, talk with others, take the steps needed, in the preparation of the teas, and in bodily preparation, TAKE NOTHING FOR GRANTED. And please, listen to what your new mind tells you while on your journey, you may find out more about yourself than you ever thought possible."
82624,First Psychadelic Experience - Very Intense,TheAlchemist,"Dec 7, 2015",H.B. Woodrose,"A found out about Hawaiian baby wood-rose online so I decided to order some and try it. A friend of mine was also keen to try them see met up one weekend and prepared for our trip. I\'m definitely glad I ordered these seeds because they give you one amazing trip which I will definitely be trying again soon.     2:00pm - I prepared a tea for us with a total of 20 seeds in it. We both drank half, making a total of 10 seeds each. We both agreed that it made our stomach feel a little queasy, and also inebriated in a newly unexplainable way.     2:55pm - However, we decided we wanted more. I then proceeded to eat 5 more seeds. It tasted somewhat like chewing on popcorn seeds which didn\'t taste too bad. My friend ate 10 more seeds. We held the mush under our tongues and could feel almost immediate effects. Very soon we were both definitely tripping out.     3:45 - We both noticed that our eyes had now nearly completely dilated. It was as if I had just awoken and turned on a bright light. Our eyes were almost completely black which looked pretty cool. The high was also intensifying. I find myself rubbing the side of my face on my desk because it felt particularly good. My friend watches curiously with widened eyes and a big grin.    4:20pm - I have completely lost sense of space and time. It is as if time and space have collided and broken into tiny pieces. My spatial perceptions are completely gone. Down at my legs and it is as if they extend for miles. I feel as if I am somehow drifting out of my body and merging with my adjacent environment. The walls and floors begin rippling like when a stone is dropped in still water. The house itself seems to pulsate with energy. I feel as if I have become aware that my mind and body are two separate things.    5:00pm -Everything seems funny. I cannot help but laugh when my friend attempts to talk to me. He is tripping balls and so am I. We both agree that we have become filled with a sense of elation, similar to when taking ecstasy. We sit and play video games and it almost feels as if we are really IN the game, it was awesome.      6:00pm - I feel as if my face is droopy and melting. I cannot help but play with my face. It feels as if my face stretches like play-dough when I pull and tug at it. I suck on my thumb and lie down on a couch like a baby. I feel intensely satisfied. Everything seems perfect. I experienced a moment of complete, utter clarity. My spatial perceptions are still non existent. It is as if I exist in multiple locations at the same time, a very strange feeling.      6:45pm - We decide to go outside for some unknown reason. I find myself looking up at the sky, captivated by a light show display of stars. The stars appear to be blinking in synchronization almost like lights seen at a rave. The trees, while in reality  probably just being blown by wind, appeared to be dancing to the movement of the stars.     8:00pm - My friend sketched out and ran home. It takes about 15mins to drive to his house. Who knows how long it took him to walk home. He left his bike at my house too. By now I was getting very tired so I decided to sleep. Sleep came very easy and I remember having some really cool dreams.     I awoke early the next day with a sense of enlightenment. The sun was still coming up so I sat on our deck eating breakfast. Everything seemed incredibly beautiful. It was like I could see light particles reflecting off every little leaf on every tree in sight, probably one of the most amazing things I\'ve ever seen. My friend claimed he experienced this same feeling the following morning.    All in all, Hawaiian baby wood-rose was an amazing experience that I definitely want to try again."
77696,A Cautionary Tale,Ecco,"Oct 28, 2015",H.B. Woodrose,"I haven\'t had much experience with drugs other than alcohol and trying DXM a few months before this. Before trying anything I would do as much reasearch as I can about any particular drug I wanted to take. I had read about DXM for many hours from many sources. The experience was pleasant but not something I feel the need to try again. I wanted something else.    I started a week ago from this experience mostly reading about Salvia and LSA. I did not want to order online and instead wanted a drug I could buy with cash at a head shop. When I got the headshop they did not have any fresh salvia leaves for the chewing method. I did not have anything to smoke salvia with so I bought Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. The guy at the shop explained a bit about the seeds to me, suggesting I take something for the nausea. Everything which I already knew and read about. I also assumed since this was a headshop that he would not be selling me seeds laced with the poison of commercial morning glory seeds. Although I did not ask this specifically.    I go home and read a little bit more on H.B. woodrose. I understand the main negative effect is anxiety/panic people experience while going through psychedelics. The other one being nausea which seemed to be less common and not something anyone really complained that much about.    It is a few hours after I purchased the seeds around 3:30pm and I am excited to try it but I decide to only take one to see what effect it would have. I remove the husk but chew and swallow the whole seed. The taste was mostly bland and a little bitter but not unbearable. An hour later my arms and legs feel a bit off and for some reason I can\'t sit still. My inner thighs feel strained when I try to walk so I go on my laptop while laying down. For the next few hours I am shifting and kicking my legs on the bed they feel somewhat numb although this doesn\'t usually happen when I lay down so I attribute this to the seed. Also, I have been fighting a mild feeling of nausea since ingesting the one seed.    The side effect I felt on one seed were quite mild and I decide 2 days later to try another 4 of the 5 I have remaining. I remove the husk but not the dark part surrounding the seed which people say give you the nausea, although I have heard someone else say that nausea is an intrinsic nature of the seed itself. I chew the seeds as finely I can, one at a time before swallowing. Each seed taste more bitter than the last and bitter taste lingers in my mouth even after a glass of water.    I am in my room after having ingested the seeds. It is 11:30am and I have not eaten anything since the night before. The blinds are closed and I attempt to watch a sitcom on my computer to bring myself into a happy mood. Minutes into it I feel a rush in my face, my ears are hot and so are my cheeks. A strange feeling but also a nauseous one. I lay down to wait for the nausea to subside.    I lay down partially on my side with my eyes closed. I attempt to sleep though every time I nearly fall asleep something in my mind jerks my body and my legs kick keeping me awake. I look at the clock and 2 hours have past in my attempt to sleep away the nausea. I feel better so I get up. My thighs feel strained from walking, more so than with the one seed. I look in the mirror and my eyes are very dilated. I am not tripping. Everything is normal and the only effect I have is that disconnected feeling I have with my body.      I attempt to watch something on the computer to see if anything has changed with my perception. I turn on the news, everything is normal. Typing and using the mouse feels difficult. I merely watch. After a few minutes my head feels funny. The hot sensation in my ears and face return and my stomach is churning. I move as quickly as I can to the bathroom and as soon I make it over the toilet bowl I throw up. It is mostly clear stomach acid, I do not see the seeds. I feel better and hope thats the last of the sick feeling now that I\'ve thrown up.    I lay down on my bed again, laying down helps with the nausea, watching moving images only makes it worse. I lay there for an hour, its 3pm. The feeling comes back. I run to the bathroom and throw up once more. I sit there for half an hour in case I need to throw up again. I am hungry now so I grab a bag of chips and a drink. The smell from the bag of chips makes me nauseous. I run to the bathroom and vomit again into the toilet just as I make over the bowl again.    I sit in the bathroom some more. At this point I am very disappointed. I throw the last seed out. The only thing I experience on the seeds is a mild disconnect from the body, no changes in the perception of the world no open or closed eye visuals, nothing. What I have is the feeling of nausea since ingesting the seeds. I puke 5 times in total. Each time more violently and with more stomach content coming out than the last.     The last time I vomited was at 8:30pm about 9 hours after taking the seeds. An hour later I attempt to eat bread and have some water. Something I wouldn\'t mind too much if I had to throw them up. I don\'t. I go to sleep and slowly regain appetite over 24 hours.    In conclusion: For those who do not want to read the long winded bit. 4 seeds equaled 9 hours of nausea and intermittent vomiting about every 2 hours.    Some would say that it may be my method of preparation, my own body chemistry, or the fact that they may not be organically grown. I do not know the answer to these. Only that I do NOT RECOMMEND. I am done with drugs and will stick to alcohol. If you really want to take a psychedelic, try something else."
94782,Clarity and Euphoria - Cold and Warmth,sisterray060,"Feb 2, 2014",H.B. Woodrose & Methoxetamine,"Let me start off this report by saying that i already had some experience with both of these substances separately and had decided that i would make a day of combining them. Also note that the night before I had went out on 8 hbw seeds which may have created some kind of tolerance for this experience and had been drinking, but not very much, as I was looking after a my co-tripper of the day J who was very very drunk on that night. So J was very hangover on this day.    0:00  Crushed the 12 seeds using a glass, and chewed them along with a packet of barbeque crisps to mask the taste of the seeds. A taste which I despise. This completely masked the taste.    0:05  Eyeballed probably around 50mg of mxe on the edge of a knife and applied this sublingually. At this time I also crushed 8 seeds for J to have, which he ate in the same way as me, with a packet of crisps. I open a beer at this point as I know that a small amount of alcohol acts a vasodilator, which would counteract the leg pains I seem to get on hbwr. In hindsight this did work for me and I will definitely repeat this.    0:20  Both I and J decided to go take showers, as we both feel quite grotty from the night before.    1:00  At the end of a long shower I can feel the effects of the mxe coming on. Things seem quite odd as usual. It feels almost like Im drying myself, somewhere where Ive never been before but I can recognised everything around me. Like a strange form of dj vu. This is a light feeling which I decide to ignore.    1:30  go to Js room find myself quite wonky(my only way of describing the come up of mxe) I suggest we should take a walk in a large park nearby. But as we go over to my room J suddenly needs to throw up, and run promptly to the toilet to do so (I believe here he threw up the seeds)    1:35  feeling wary, but deciding to go ahead with it any way, I eyeball for J, the same dose of mxe.    2:00  We start walking to the park, its very cold and icy, but I cant really feel the temperature, as the mxe is making me feeling intoxicated, much like alcohol, except that everything I walk past seems to have the most strange proportions. Mxe, for me at least, makes me unable to take in the proportions of objects, everything looks out of shape. For example the trees Im passing have a really odd build to them and dont seem well placed.    2:30-3:30  The ponds in the park are frozen over and just look so beautiful and calm. The ducks and other birds look beautiful and so odd. Especially the fur on the head of the duck, its just the most powerful green. I feel so calm here walking through this vast empty nature-filled area in the middle of a city. This hour seems like an eternity of calm and clarity. Time has stretched beyond measure. This one hour felt like 5 at least. We go to a shop at the end of this hour, and I buy a bottle of orangina, as soon as I taste this I I get an instant hark back to when I was a kid on holiday with my cousins and family, its such a beautiful taste, and brings me the warmth of that holiday, even though Im slipping around on ice. At this point we walk to a nearby art gallery as this should be a calm, warm and empty place, where we wont need to see anyone we know. We start  feeling painfully cold during this walk.    4:00  Were sitting on a pair of very comfortable chairs, when a kid walks in, looks at us strangely, and quickly walks out. We start talking about how this kid might remember this random encounter in future years to come and how we imprint ourselves in peoples memories. People we will never know, that is.  4:15 we find a pair of chairs upstairs that are far more comfortable, I can feel the mxe coming down throughout the gallery, but the lsa is definitely come up, touch is getting great, find myself rubbing my hands with the biggest grin on my face, I just feel great. I absolutely love the sedated euphoria of lsa.    4:30  we have found some heaters in the gallery and have proceeded to wrap ourselves around them.  I have the most beautiful sense of warmth running through me, as well as the warmth of the heater, feeling fantastic. I noticed visual distortions, like that of lsa, looking at a large quote on the wall, I was unable to read as the letters would move and breath and morph, to the degree that I was too distracted to take in what I was looking at.    4:45  before leaving we have a last look around the gallery, and notice how much different each of the rooms seem since the mxe has started coming down, sort of like that feeling of odd dj vu I described earlier.    5:00  Me and J are back at my room; J seems quite sober, still a bit hungover and is playing around on my laptop. Choosing songs and lurking online. All of a sudden Im hit by the most unstoppable feelings of euphoria and pleasure, I soon started stumbling around my room, rolling around on the floor and throwing coats and blankets around my head in complete bliss and ecstasy. Its completely uncontrollable, if someone would have walked in at that time, I would not have been able to compose myself, and no matter who it was, I wouldve continued rolling around laughing frantically and smiling hugely.    5:15  the euphorias long gone, but my skin still feels amazing. The thing I love about lsa, is that even after a short burst of sedated euphoria, I dont feel sad about that bit ending, because I end up sliding into a whole other state that is just beautiful. A couple of friends come into my room at this point. I act comfortable and never tell them Im on anything, and they dont suspect it.    5:45  I still feel absolutely comfortable and nice, but touch has stopped feeling so amazing. I try to eat something at this point but its hard, and I cant stomach too much, very slight stomach discomfort at this point, but nothing really.    6:30  Go out to a restaurant with a few other friends without J. I dont tell them Ive been on anything. Visual distortions are still going on, and my visual still feels breathy, especially when looking at patterns    7:00  Finding it difficult to focus on what everyones saying, and my vision is quite messed up, notice this especially when in the toilet, when the patterned wall in front of my is moving back and forth.    8:00  feeling like the lsa has finally come down, but Im still damn sedated, end sitting around with a few mates and watch a film with some tea.    12:00 - still feeling sedated and comfortable. As soon as my head hits the pillow Im out cold.    22:00 - I woke up the next day feeling lovely, was so hard to get out of bed though, as it felt like I was on holiday in a warm country with sounds outside my window bringing back to places I havent been in years, Ive never felt that comfortable in that bed before, even during these winter months.    This was probably one my best experiences with any substance other than alcohol. I just cant for some sunny weather to try this again as I had a beautiful time and the only thing getting in the way was the iciness and coldness. Lsa is a beautiful psychedelic and I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach it to try it at least a couple of times. Mxe I definitely think should be treated with some kind of caution, but is a lovely drug when used right, and can be very interesting."
88889,The Pusher of Universes,psychrick,"Jan 14, 2014",H.B. Woodrose & Salvia divinorum,"About two or more years ago I started getting very interested in Entheogens and medicinal botanicals. I have already vastly entered the realms of psychedelia and drugs. More recently though I have found a new respect for drugs and life in general.    My experiences with entheogens such as mushrooms, lsd, salvia, mdma, lsa, hash have been crucial to my growth in spirituality and altered-states. Other drugs I have experimented with but now avoid are pharmaceuticals (Xanax, aderrall, valium, oxycontin etc.), alcohol, heroin, dxm (robo).    I have found that treating the substance respectfully by creating an experience with a well planned set and setting is the best way to experience any drug but mostly in my case, Entheogens and psychedelics. Which is what leads me to my latest experience with the Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seed and smoking salvia extract in the peak of my hbws trip.     PREPERATION: I grinded 10 seeds in a coffee grinder, then mixed em with some applesauce and enjoyed.     ONSET: Within 45 minutes I notice a pleasant tingling or light buzzing in my legs and head. I got a little cold in my house to I decided to go on a walk for a bit. When I was walking I felt a little bit cramping or pain in my stomach area so I then sparked up my cannabis joint, which immediatley calmed any discomfort. After the joint and a half of mile walk I started feeling alert and felt a pressure around my eyes, not umpeasant at all, something that reminds me of when doing lsd. Energy bursts were creeping up on me anywhere from my inner thighs to my feet and head and body, so I decided to stroll on back home.     Once I walked inside and took my shoes off, I quickly noticed an amazing amount of euphoria and bliss enter my consciousness much like a wave of lsd but with no visuals. At this point I sat relaxed on my couch and turned up some psychedelic music. Being a musician I suddenly realized how amazing and deep the music sounded. I layed back and let the music and energy waves coexist in my sensory field. Closing my eyes I saw green tunnels moving fast and eventually stopping at this huge neon green ball of light that was so vivid I knew it was a c.e.v.     After about another hour and a half of exploring my closed eye visuals which were no where near mushrooms or lsd, but nonetheless very pleasant with the aid of music, I decided to take it up a few notches. I packed a nice sized hit of salvia 10x in my glass pipe and dimmed the lights and began meditating for I was not a begginer of the sacred herb and knew very well what sally could do.    I then acknowledged the power of salvia divinorum and asked her to give me a insightful and not to intense experience since I was already tripping. I wanted to break thru to the salvia dimensions, but I did not want to experience any \'turbulence\'. With that said I hit the pipe without letting the lighter stop burning the herb and took a huge hit and held it in for over 30 seconds.     By the time I blew out the hit I saw my visual plane almost crack in time and within ten seconds I felt like I was being pushed really fast and squished next to other bodies of flesh. I was being pulled deep into the salvia world, with no idea what I was getting myself into. Finally after what seemed ten minutes I felt as if the force pushing me relaxed and I was able to vividly witness one huge archetypal image of multiple universes including ours being organized and controlled by this \'pusher\'. My emotions were shocked with this feeling of being infused with this pusher that pulled me out of my dimension. It was as if time was no more. I had no thought of the normal plane we all experience every day. My sole purpose was to move universes and spirits in correct alignment with me. Remember I fused with the pusher archetype that pulled me into this realm.    A vision of my infused form with the pusher entity was seen in a out of body experience like view. It is hard to explain what its appearance was. I can most closely relate it to a catapillar and a train and colorful images on its body and spirals around its aura. The vision lasted for a while, but slowly but surely was fading away and slowly but surely I realized I was looking at my living room.     I was cracking up when I realized I just came back from the salvia trip because I actually forgot I was a human. I was like...\'no way!! Wow I forgot!\'. After laying down and feeling the huge euphoric infusions of the afterglow of salvia and the lsa from the seeds. The salvia comedown intensified my lsa effects for 2 hours and I was literally getting amazing visuals that felt cartoon-like, some breathing or moving/dancing qualities on surfaces. I noticed very bright lights and almost tracer like images from lights in any form. The euphoria from the seeds were still waving in and out and slowly the salvia afterglow was gone.     I smoked another joint and realized after the salvia experience fully subsided I was actually quite stimutlated. I went on a bike ride and then went home and talked on the phone to close friends enthusiastically. A lot of research I have done for hbws say that they are sedating for most people compared to the stimulating effects of lsd. I personally felt almost the same effects from lsd except the visuals, and the intense spiritual talkative mindset.    Overall Hbw seeds were not that nauseating as I thought they would be, they were actually quite stimulating, marked euphoria, energy burts, entactogenic qualities, very few opened eye visual, more chance of simple fantasy or imaganitive closed eye visuals, any discomfort from cramps were nuetralized from cannabis. The euphoric mind set was perfect for inducing me into the salvia trance, but I strongly suggest you be careful because I noticed the salvia trip seemed to last alot longer when I was on hbw seeds compared to just stoned or baseline. I also recall feeling like I was in the experience a lot longer, it seemed a lifetime before my return to home base. So if you don\'t want to have a very long in depth salvia experience that can be quite intense, then dont do hbw seeds first, but overall it was the most unique entheogenic experience I\'ve had yet."
86315,The Horror! The Horror?,Ace,"Jan 8, 2014",H.B. Woodrose,"I got the seeds through the post and I was a bit disappointed to find that the packet only contained 8 seeds. I was planning on doing the seeds with a mate, but four each didn\'t sound too exciting. I hadn\'t fasted at all, I really couldn\'t be bothered with doing that and I am happy with that decision because when I was sick it was not as a result of not fasting beforehand.    Anyway when my parents went out at about 2pm, I crushed them, squashed them a bit with a pestle and mortar and chewed them for ages. Nothing happened for a about an hour and a half. The first thing I noticed was these little flashes I saw at the corner of my eye, a bit like camera flashes. Then after a while, almost without me realising, I slipped into the trip and felt intensely happy. It was a high like nothing else I had felt before. It was like I was actually experiencing pure heaven and I could feel it in my body. Even the nausea actually felt good. Then my parents got home, I was a bit worried about this but I was still loving the trip and I felt as I was one with everyone on earth. I don\'t really remember too much about the first hour and half or so to be honest, but I think I watched a couple of videos and listened to some trippy music. Then dinner was ready...oh shit I thought. I went down stairs, put a tiny bit on my plate took a few mouthfuls and promptly rushed outside. I puked, well, I thought I did, but there seems to be no trace of puke anywhere, so it could have been a dry heave but I was so fucked that it certainly just felt as if I had been sick. I then lay down on the path, feeling that I needed to completely connect myself with the earth and lie with nature. My mum came over and I jumped up onto my feet as soon I saw her but she knew that I had been lying there and she was clearly really worried. I told her that I was on the seeds which she knew I had got through the post earlier and I told her everything was ok, but dear god, I did not mean it.    At this point I was actually experiencing hell and my mum being worried really made it worse. I went upstairs and back onto the computer. I felt intensely embarrassed and I was feeling full on despair. I\'m not gonna make joke about this, this is a genuine warning, this despair is like nothing else and there have been cases (albeit very rare ones) where people have gone into cardiac arrest because the feeling can become so strong. For me it developed into a feeling as if all the hopelessness of the entirety of reality was being experienced by me and only me. Death seemed like an easy escape and the urge to commit suicide was extremely hard to suppress. I felt delirious and overcome with complete insanity like that of what you see when you see some poor sod going bananas in a funny farm. At one point I looked down onto my bedroom floor and my imagination completely took over as I saw a hole that was going down into hell. I went in the toilet and sat on it for a good while, wimpering like a dog who\'s just been kicked in the bollocks. I considered having a shower, thinking it would just \'wash all of these emotions away\' but I couldn\'t bring myself to do anything really.    I went back into my room, and then about five seconds later went to sit back on the bog. I know it sounds absurd but the feeling of pulling my trousers down gave me a brief, slight, inkling of relief, God knows why. After a while I managed to calm myself slightly but I still felt as if I was walking a tightrope above an opening into hell and this state lasted for about two hours or something. My dad came upstairs, he needed to use the PC. He seemed pretty chilled with me taking the seeds and made some joke about the Grateful Dead. It made me feel intensely more happy and more comfortable and I went downstairs and talked to my mum about how it felt. I was a bit more sober by this point and I was able to talk in fairly coherent manner. All the colours seemed really really bright and vibrant which was something I had only just started to appreciate. I was feeling really good again. My parents went to bed and I went back onto the PC, and I stayed up till about 4 am, still tripping a bit even then.     Some other aspects of the experience were also very interesting. The most interesting was I was able to access my dream world and I could suddenly remember dreams that I had from the night before and even a dream in which I seemed to live an entire existence in even with friends there. It seemed like I recognized everything in it perfectly and as I closed my eyes I was able to experience it. It felt as if I had thought about this dream many times before but at the same time I couldn\'t actually remember ever consciously thinking about it before. It involved a spiralling path, down into the ground, with a house at the bottom, which had someone evil in it, a witch perhaps. I also remembered other dreams, which also seemed part of this world, with the same \'imaginary dream friends\'. The fact that I could access these dreams really excited me.     One of the hallucinogenic effects that I kept experiencing was that if I looked at myself in the mirror by my PC out of the corner of my eye, I saw myself as a demon, with a really creepy smile and sharp teeth. He seemed almost like the puppet master, as if he was the \'spirit\' of the drug or even a part of me. I kept looking back at him throughout the trip.    The trip was amazing. It felt as if my subliminal consciousness was equally as prevalent as my normal consciousness and as if it was a different being altogether. Most of the hallucinations were a result of my mind not registering stuff properly such as if I looked out of the window and saw a group of flying things, I couldn\'t tell if they were birds or flies. Or they were from looking at stuff with a significant texture such as my woodchip wallpaper on which I could make out strange beasts and figures, some of them even appearing to move about. On a higher dosage I think I may see more full blown hallucinations but I dont think I\'d like to take a higher dosage. Although I experienced such incredible mental pain for a probably pretty short period of time, I am really glad that I did the trip and whether that makes me a nutter or not I don\'t know and I also don\'t really care. The trip really made me realise some home truths and also some things about life, as well as leaving me with some interesting questions. One of the most prevalent feelings was that I realised that I should just try to be myself, and not pretend to be anyone else, and we should all just, yah know, \'do our thang.\'    I realised that I shouldn\'t be bothered by what people think of me taking stuff like these seeds because they simply don\'t understand. They think I\'m doing it to be cool, like a rockstar, but of course they are wrong. My first real interest in entheogens was when I watched a programme about this tribe who ingested some plant or something that made the presenter go absolutely insane and then in another programme I saw this shaman and it just really got to me, really hit a chord. This isn\'t a recreational drug, this is for people that have an insuppressible fascination of the pure human self. For me, this fascination is the same as the fascination I felt when I spent hours in the British Mueseum.    Would I do it again? Definitely, but I think a smaller dose might be a good idea. Please, please, take care when taking this entheogen though, this is not for the faint hearted. And most of all, don\'t worry when you take it, cos the fact is, you\'ll be fine. Just have fun exploring!"
90458,Slowing Down Into Death,M,"Dec 17, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"I wanted to try HBW seeds for a long time because I heard about their hallucinogenic properties. I have had a lot of experience with other hallucinogens so I know \'the drill\' so to speak.     So I got the seeds and chewed them as well as I could before I swallowed up the paste. They tasted quite nice - almost like nuts but not quite.     The come on was quite rapid and only took about 20-30 minutes. I could feel myself wanting to yawn and was starting to have trouble walking around. At this point I knew that I was tripping.     So I went to bed to lay down and this is where it really hit me. I could feel my whole soul, my being, my consciousness, my life slowing down to a halt. Like a train with breaks on. The descend was not fast, but fast enough to be noticeable.     There were no visuals, but rather very deep thoughts. I could literally feel my self imploding on the self that was me - but not the same way as you would implode on some other drugs. More of a slow wrap up into myself. I covered myself with a blanket and just wanted to go deeper into myself as the trip progressed.     BEING INSIDE    This is where I felt anxiety. I felt as though I was coming closer and wallowing in my own spiritual pain. I felt as though I was \'there\'. This is where my pain was originating from. My bleeding soul. I wanted to cry. I could see how my life was very deficient in some very obvious ways. I could feel all the suffering that my soul was experiencing on a day to day basis - but now I was there, inside the spirit chamber.     The time started slowing down even more. I was dying. At first I wanted to panic. I would have panicked if I had never experienced this before but my I could steer my subconsciousness ashore by \'knowing\' that it was only a trip. Everything would be fine.     Usually when I go deep into my trips I wiggle my foot and hold on to my dick - because I can\'t feel my upper body so doing so is a good way to remind my brain that I\'m still alive. I don\'t know why I do it, but I guess if I knew that I was going to die then I\'d hold on tight to my dick and hope that it was only a dream. That\'s probably just me though.    I felt as though some tremendous healing was taking place inside my soul. I had a voice in my head, like the voice of an oracle that was telling me what was happening. I said that everything will be fine. It said that what I was planing to do next week would surely help me in many ways. And that felt good - getting this kind of confirmation.     DEEP SLEEP / MEDITATION    For periods of time I went in and out of deep, comatose, REM-like sleep. I was awake and yet I was deeply asleep. I suddenly realized what people who have made The Matrix must have been taking because it was exactly like The Matrix. The time was slow. The experience was like either thinking really fast when the time is slowed down speeding up the time while thinking really really slowly.    It was like experiencing the bullet time. Although my hearing was entirely unaffected by this trip. I could still hear the trains and cars go by so I was entirely conscious but I couldn\'t see and I couldn\'t move. I was deeply in the thought world where I was walking around the temple of my soul.     THE WRAITH    Another interesting thing that I have experienced was fast forward time where I was taken many years forward and shown me being old and sick and ready to die. It was like being attacked by the \'wraith\' from Stargate. It was as though I was taken to the day when I was going to die. A voice inside me was saying that I still had a lot to do in this life and that it was not my time to die - but that the time would inevitably come.     I would also occasionally wake up and feel like I wanted to throw up. So I remember myself walking to the toilet to throw up and then hanging on the toilet lid for what seemed like ages. Then I finally threw up - but this time on the floor. The puke was so acidic that it hurt my teeth it seemed. It tasted like vinegar.     Finally the trip was coming to an end. This was about 9 hours after I have first taken the seeds. It was the middle of the night and I had a meeting the next day (where I was still slightly tripping I must say - but I was hoping nobody would notice).     NEXT DAY    The next day I felt happy. I felt as though my depression was not there. I mean it was still there but I was very alert and happy. I stood on the wet train station and I could see every detail around me. I was present, here, living the life. I felt extremely joyful inside. There was definitely a halo on that day. I could effortlessly speak to people and it felt great. Everything was so soft, so colorful, so beautiful.     These seeds are definitely interesting, although if you have never experienced \'fake death\' before then you are in for a ride. The seeds showed me that we are all indeed mortal and that we are going to die some day.    I think that there is definitely a deep potential for severe anxiety if the user is not mentally prepared for a trip so I don\'t recommend large doses and do recommend ensuring that you are prepared for an experience that will take you to the \'cementary\' - not the other side - but close enough."
67516,One of the Best of My Life,Ix,"Dec 13, 2013","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Tobacco","This was my second time taking HBW, and it was without a doubt, one the most amazing experiences in my life.    For the record, all people mentioned in this are heavy weed smokers, and have experimented with magic mushrooms, E, and Salvia.    I was staying with college friends in Ireland and wanted a night to remember. I suggested we take HBW, to which two of my friends (herein referred to as A and B) agreed. There were two others who decided that they would be sitters for the night. We decided to buy 9 seeds each, which were purchased legally from a headshop. We intended to have empty stomachs at the time of ingestion.    6.00pm. After removing all the white fur from the seeds by hand, I put 6 of the seeds in my mouth, and chewed them up well. The reason for choosing this method over eating was because this way supposedly reduces feelings of nausea, which I found to be untrue. I kept them in my mouth without swallowing for half an hour, then spat them out. This was very unpleasant feeling, as my mouth filled with spit, and it had the same consistency as cum. Next time I\'ll eat them.    6.30pm. I noticed a strange feeling in my stomach, but it was very subtle. I recognised it from the first time I tried HBW. I was very much looking forward to coming up, as the first time I had tried HBW, I got very intense eye-open and eye-closed visual hallucinations. I had a cigarette. A and B eat 6 of their seeds on pizza    7.30pm. The feeling in my stomach is getting more noticeable, but its very bearable. Feels like I\'m slightly bloated or gassy. I was getting slightly impatient, so decided to listen to Pink Floyd on my own for a while, to try and help myself come up. Had another cigarette.     8.00pm. I woke up, not realising I had fallen asleep. I didn\'t fall asleep because of the HWB though, it was because I had been up since 3am. I get up to see how my friends are getting on. Neither of the two report feeling anything yet, and the 3 of us are feeling slightly annoyed. I ate my 3 remaining seeds in pizza.    9.00pm. I look in the mirror for the first time and notice that my pupils are very dilated. I start having a slight feeling of euphoria, slightly unsteady on my feet, and begin to feel tired. I go outside and talk to a friend I haven\'t seen in a few months. It was enjoyable, although she was drunk and didn\'t understand what I was experiencing. She was trying to have a normal conversation with me, which my brain just couldn\'t handle. I preferred not to talk. Had another 3 cigarettes.    10.30pm. I head back inside, when my friends inform that they\'re going to leave for a small while, and ask me to join them. Feeling quite nauseous, I decline. I make my way to the bathroom, and throw up for about 15 mintues. It\'s pretty horrible, but the bloated gassy feeling in my stomach leaves, and I feel a rush of euphoria. Leaving the bathroom, I begin to notice my first visuals. As my hand was moving through the air, it left trails. I was delighted that I was finally started to come up, as it had been nearly 5 hours, an unusually long time. I felt quite giddy, was smiling a lot, and felt generally happy.    11.00pm. I retreated to the bedroom to listen to Pink Floyd, and start moving my hand through the air, playing with the trails. It was pretty cool, as when I blinked, things would momentarily flash a different colour. Very strong purples, and neon greens appeared around the edges of things. Was feeling slightly more tired now, and my legs were stiff and sore. I close my eyes and start having mild eye-closed visuals. It was very similar to what you\'d see in a music visualiser, on iTunes for example, except that the images in my mind were a lot better.     12.00am. My friends return and have managed to get some weed on their travels. Delighted, I instantly get out of bed, feeling almost normal again. A and B report feeling very euphoric, and having mild visuals. Their pupils are enormous. We roll a joint each, and I hit two large bongs. This is much more than I normally smoke, my judgement no doubt impaired, and I began to feel sick. I make my way to the balcony, and start puking violently. The 2 sitters come outside to keep me company, and to make sure I was alright. I continued vomiting for what felt like half an hour, although I was experiencing pretty strong time dilation, so it was probably more like 10 minutes. I have now puked so much, that there is nothing left in my stomach, but the feeling of nausea is still so intense that I begin dry-heaving. At my sitters\' suggestion, I drink some water, which allowed me throw up again. I felt much better, and went back inside.    12.30am. This is when I really started to hallucinate. I sat on the couch, my legs were quite sore, and I was too tired to talk properly. The first thing I noticed was that the movement trails were a lot more intense. They were multicoloured and I could see them everywhere. When I moved my head forward, I could \'zoom in\' very close on something far away, and \'zoom out\' when I pulled my head back. It was very cool, very intense. Next, I noticed that everything I could see was changing, into computer game graphics! Everything took on 8-bit graphics, very similar to the NES. This was unbelievable, as I could see everything so clearly, but it didn\'t last very long, maybe 3 minutes. While sitting on the couch, parts of my body started disappearing. Example, I could feel my chest and my legs, but my pelvis area disappeared completely. I continued smoking weed, but only in small amounts, as it made me hallucinate very intensely. When not smoking weed, I found myself smoking 2 or even 3 cigarettes at a time, as it felt very soothing.    2.00am. I head to the bedroom area, where A and B have been lying down, listening to Pink Floyd. I lie down on the bed, and close my eyes. Since I last vomited, I haven\'t felt any nausea whatsoever, which gives me a huge sense of relief. I feel very tired, my legs are really sore, but I haven\'t stopped smiling. A and B are completely tripping balls at this stage too, and the 3 of us together just lie on the bed, talking, trying to communicate how we feel to one another. It made for a great bonding session, and definitely strengthened our friendships. I fell asleep around 3.00am.    Next day    Woke up around 11.00am, feeling pretty sluggish, but otherwise, felt perfectly fine. We smoked some weed, and watched cheech and chong. We spent the day talking about the night, and all 3 of us agreed it was definitely one of the best experiences we\'ve ever had. I continued having very very mild trails for the whole of the next day.     In hindsight: Having lots of cigarettes was key. I am definitely glad we had some weed, as it helped to bring me up a lot, although, I\'m not sure if this presents and dangers from mixing drugs. I don\'t think I\'d like to mix with alcohol. We had lots of really mellow music, and a safe, positive environment. The hallucinations seemed to come in waves, and as the night progressed, the got more frequent and stronger. The puking sucked balls, in fact, it\'s one of the worst pukes I\'ve ever had, but I really started to come up afterwards.    Conclusion: Totally fucking awesome stuff, although it\'ll be a few months before I try it again."
75530,Kensho,JustMe,"Nov 18, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"For at least two years after my Woodrose trip I professed the experience as the most poignant and profound moment of my life. Since an early age I was a thoughtful soul and have always had an interest in religion, theology, God, the universe etc. And indeed I am happy to find in my later years, that there still is an albeit marginalised society of like minded souls in the world who are explorers of the conscience. I had always felt that longing that we all feel but can\'t place, for the truth.      The Monk Bought Lunch    I had had this bag of twenty seeds for a while now but had not tried them. What brought me to them was that I was in an incredibly low place, almost certainly because of the not so copious amount of skunk I had smoked in the past few years. I was depressed and mildly psychotic. This nadir I could no longer bare and hence turned to the extreme. I needed something, I wanted something to change. So alone in my London flat, prepared a single seed, burning and scraping the fur, then smashed it with a hammer in a bag. Ingested the shattered seed chased with a glass of water. To no avail. Following a half hour or so of mild visual disturbance I decided to drop another four seeds. Many of you will be rightly thinking \'What is this idiot doing?  No sitter, jumping up to a four fold dose.\' No excuse, like I say I was pretty much fucked anyway.    So away to my bedroom, the tv playing a documentary about whales, perfectly trippy stuff. It all of a sudden occurred to me that the effects I was experiencing where very similiar to a migraine (a teenage affliction of mine) but without the headache. As a medical student, I was analyzing precisely the association between the alkaloids battering my synapses and the abberent neurological activity in migraines. As a whale I was writhing around on my mattress uncontrollably. This was the classic trip, visually the tv was amazing but I could hardly regard it, cognitively I was a whale and at that point my good friend called me on the phone and I told him so.      Hell    This was insignificant in light of what was to come. My uncle called me on the phone and this is where it went wrong.I just told him I had a migraine and couldn\'t speak, but non-the less it was enough to send me on a bad trip. This was the worst fear and utter hellishness that I have ever and hopefully will ever experience. I would never wish it upon anyone. Nausea ensued and absolute loss of hearing. I ran myself a bath, to quote Sylvia Plath \'there must be quite a few things a hot bath won\'t cure - I just don\'t know any\'. I sat there in the tub thoroughly gutted. Spontaneously that scene from the film of The Doors flashed into my mind where Jim Morrison is sitting in the bath dead. I considered \'what if I am already dead?\' It occurred to me that I was already dead. This was the death of my ego. I realised that what religion describes as hell is the letting go of and moving through at death, all the shit that one\'s ego accumulates. All the stress, anxiety and negativity that I had been for the sake of my ego I had to move through in dissolution. Further to this I pulled myself through it on the notion that what if everything I did from now on had only pureness and goodness of heart, then nothing else could touch me.      \'This is the best part of the trip. The trip...the best part.\'    I was dried and in bed. This was the moment that my life had been leading to. Everything was exactly the way it was supposed to be. It all made sense. It was perfect and it was so simple. Everything that I had ever read, the Baghvad Gita, the Dammapada the Upanishads, everything I had ever tried to understand or grasp, I knew and understood everything at this one point in time. It was so perfect and simple. This was God. I knew at the time though that it was not everything. I knew there was still a lot of myself I could not let go of or sacrifice. But this was at least a glimpse of God. I knew even at the time it was what Zen Buddhists call Kensho, a transient clarity or revelation. Visually throughout there was simply a central focus of dull orange glow which I was surprised at since you always hear of brilliant white light. But visuals were entirely insignificant to me, it was an almost completely intellectual and spiritual experience.    For at least a year after that I was more alive than I had been for a long time. I was very much changed for the better. I saw God in everything, the same pattern, the same beauty. Nothing else mattered or troubled me because I no longer had faith in something greater, I had knowledge, I knew that there was a deeper truth. And being safe in that knowledge of a deeper truth, I lived without fear, passing everything I did, all of my Karma sacrificed up to God. I hoped that it would stick but suspected that it wouldn\'t. And indeed, nigh on three years later, although still by far the better for it, I have forgotten most of it or rather I can not feel it any more. I am too scared to take woodrose again currently as it was such an intense experience and feel I don\'t really need it at the moment. But at some later point in life I may dare to explore it again. I have been experimenting with Salvia and cactus with some interesting superficial trips but nothing has shown me God like LSA."
69951,Very Intense,B,"Jul 21, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"As an introduction, I\'ll say I\'m not super experienced with psychoactives, but I\'ve been around a little. I had heard about these seeds that were related to LSD, and figured I\'d check it out. I decided to order 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds of the actual Hawaiian strain, which is reputed to be the strongest.    They arrived a few days later, and I was surprised at how tiny they were. Each seed had a triangular shaped base that culminated in the germ eye, with the top side being round and the whole seed being about the size of a pencil top eraser. All fifty fit easily in a 2x2 baggy, and I was a little skeptical as to the potency of something so small (which is probably what led me to take a perhaps to large dose). I scraped off the fuzz which supposedly causes a lot of the nausea these things have a reputation for. I found the tip of a steak knife to work best for this.    I woke up early the next day so as to give myself plenty of time to feel my high before becoming tired. This is an approximate timeline of events, as my sense of time passage was severely impaired.    Dose Time +0:00 -- I decide I don\'t want to drink a lukewarm tea of plant material like I had heard a lot of people do, so I pop them in my mouth one by one and chew them, twelve seeds in all which is labeled as a \'heavy\' dose. The small brown seeds are surprisingly hard, and I have to bite down with quite a bit of force to get them to crack. They taste awful; I remember thinking that they tasted very oddly like beef jerky, but in the worst way possible. After washing each seed down with a swig of Cherry Coke, I set about amusing myself until effects kick in.    Dose Time +0:30 -- I suddenly realise I\'m quite nauseous despite having had nothing to eat so far that day and scraping off the seed coating. I try not to hurl as I read online articles in an attempt to keep myself occupied.    Dose Time +2:00 -- Just as suddenly as it set in, the nausea disappears completely. I realize that I\'m heavily intoxicated, with symptoms feeling very similar to being drunk. Upon standing up, I feel a surprisingly painful sensation in my legs, and remember that LSA constricts leg veins. In an indescribable way, it does feel like my veins have constricted almost shut. Walking is stiff and painful, but I take this as a sign that the LSA is working and enjoy my intoxication.    Dose Time +3:00 -- Intoxication continues, with added muscle stiffness. My reflexes feel slow; like I couldn\'t move quickly or precisely if I had wanted to, but it\'s an oddly pleasant sensation. I start to notice a severe time distortion; much more intense than what I would experience on marijuana. I seem to be taking in much more information than what should be possible in a set amount of time. I get up to talk to my roommate (M), who\'s getting ready for work. Talking is fun, but I have to make a point to move my mouth enough not to slur. I sit down to watch the newly risen sun, and the already bright colors look more vibrant and engaging. I started to laugh for no particular reason, and had trouble shutting my jaw. It felt similar to trying to close my mouth in the middle of yawning. This made me laugh even harder and I spent a good five minutes just giggling to myself and trying to close my mouth. Everything began to feel enormously soft and I started to touch things just to enjoy how they feel.    Dose Time +3:15 -- Just as M is leaving, I start to notice mental effects setting in. Up until this point I had noticed only a \'body high\'. I find that I\'m fascinated with whatever I\'m looking at, and could have spent a half hour staring at a blank wall and been perfectly happy.    Dose Time +4:00 -- Mental distraction increases (and at this point is very pleasant), and so does an intense euphoria. I have honestly never felt better or been happier in my life. I start to do repetitive, rhythmic tapping on or with whatever is close by. My body seems somewhat numb and my appendages sometimes feel a little off-center. Along with the time distortion, I now feel like sensory input is reaching my brain at three or four different speeds; noises or movements I make are happening at one speed, movements other things make are traveling at a different rate, and audio input is happening at yet another speed. It\'s an insane feeling and my impaired brain tries to comprehend how everything can be timed differently yet still synch up. I start to wonder what a video game would be like in this state, so I start playing Counter Strike. I figure I\'ll be almost useless, but I\'ve honestly never played better. Because everything was so distorted, it seemed like other people were moving in slow motion, but I was reacting and moving quicker than I ever had. Getting head shots or responding to someone jumping out suddenly and blazing at me became childishly easy. My mind also seemed to have split as well. One part was still completely inebriated and distracted, one part seemed to be playing the game for me, and yet another part seemed to be thinking clearly and in another place entirely. I seemed to be able to double- and triple-task, and laughed at the thought of me actually being able to do everything better high. I\'ll also note that any movement I made or saw seemed much more fluid; kind of like moving underwater. There was no jerkiness to anything.    Dose Time +5:00 -- I start to wander around aimlessly, enjoying my high. Listening to music is amazing; every rhythm is heard and every beat or word seems to be in exactly the right place. I was appreciating new things about a Bone Thugz C.D. I had heard thousands of times.    Dose Time +5:20 -- Music suddenly seems too rhythmic and I find myself wanting it to stop. Mental distraction seems to be a little intense now, were as before it was just fun but now it\'s beginning to be overpowering. I assume I\'ve just had to much of a good thing, so I turn off my music and sit down to continue playing my game.    Dose Time +5:30 -- Without really realizing it was happening, I start to become so impaired that it\'s like I\'m not even watching what\'s going on in front of me. It felt very much like a dream, and I got up and started walking around without realizing were I was. I have no idea how long I stumbled around and I think the only thing that made me snap out of it was sudden, intense nausea. I bolted to the bathroom and knew I had to vomit. I was extremely confused and barely thinking. It took me a solid minute to figure out were I could vomit despite the fact that I was standing inches away from a bathtub, toilet, and trashcan. I actually almost emptied the trashcan into the toilet before realizing that just vomiting into the toilet would make more sense. I stood there, slightly bent over, not daring to move, just wondering if I was going to throw up. I was at this point more than a little scared; even though I knew a lot of people threw up these seeds I hadn\'t thought it would happen to me as someone who pretty much never vomits. Vomiting, to me at least, was a sign that something had gone horribly wrong. But I did vomit. I vomited probably more than I ever have. I stood there trying to hit the toilet and managed to hit the toilet and everything around it and it was like I was dreaming. Everything was so foggy and surreal that I still sometimes wonder if I threw up at all or that I just hallucinated it.    When my stomach finally settled, I collapsed on the edge of the tub. I was suddenly exhausted, and couldn\'t even wipe the vomit off my face. For reasons that made sense at the time, but now completely escape me, I started thinking about everything that was bad about my life, and everything I hated about myself. I remember wondering how much slitting my wrists would hurt, and wishing fervently that I owned a gun. I wondered how they would find me dead, and what the news report would be like. Mostly, I thought about my mom and what she would do. Ultimately I think that\'s what kept me from killing myself.    I have no idea how long I sat there, but it felt like hours. I was depressed, self-loathing, and terrified. I had no idea what I was going to do next, and knew I was freaking out. Luckily, I had just enough drug experience to know that I absolutely had to come down before doing anything rash, even though I could barely stand living another second. So, after a long discussion with myself, I got up and wiped up the mess I had made. I missed a lot; I could barley see or understand what I was doing, although I was thinking slightly clearer than before I had vomited. I crawled into my room and collapsed into bed. My bed felt wonderful, and I was incredibly tired, but I didn\'t get to sleep for hours. I was still scared and depressed, and still very, very high; only now none of that high was enjoyable. I was very aware of how square my room was, and I had difficulty separating myself from it. I constantly had to move my arms or it would feel as though they weren\'t there. I did finally manage to get to sleep, though, and I slept clear into that evening.    I woke up completely sober, and I\'d never been so glad or so thankful to be alive. For the next couple of days I had an appreciation of everything around me I\'d never experienced before. By the weeks end I was feeling completely normal again, but I think I can say that this was a very powerful experience.    CONCLUSION -- I hear this drug called the \'legal cousin of LSD\' a lot. Now, I\'ve never done acid but from what I\'ve heard people describe and the effects I experienced on LSA I would say the two are nothing alike. I\'d classify the effects of LSA as very stimulating/intoxicating, not hallucinatory. I experienced pretty much no visuals, with eyes open or closed. I would say the first two hours of effects were very similar to alcohol intoxication with no mental effects. After that, mental effects set it (euphoria, distraction, time/sensory distortion) with a few more body effects (numbness and tactile sensations; the intoxication remains throughout the experience. If I had to compare the full effects to anything, I would say they were similar to Ecstasy. I\'ve never done ecstasy, but again from what I\'ve heard it described as they seem very similar; the overpowering euphoria, the rhythmic stimulation, the appreciation of music, and the seemingly harsh comedown. This drug also seems to have an odd timeline. Effects don\'t just come on then fade, they seem to jolt on in stages of effects. After ingestion, nausea lasted about two hours, then drunkeness set in. An hour and a half to two hours later, mental effects rapidly set in and increased until I peaked an additional two hours later, at which point I started to crash down. I tried these seeds one other time, ingesting four seeds in an attempt to alleviate some nausea and make the comedown less harsh. I actually experienced more nausea than I had with twelve seeds, and the effects were only annoying at best (no crash, though). Because these seeds seem much too intense at high doses, and definitely not worth it at low doses, I\'m going to try extracting the LSA and ingesting only that. From what I can tell, the seeds are what cause all the nausea, not the LSA itself. Woodrose seeds apparently contain cyanide, similar to apple seeds, which is why I think scrapping off the fuzz probably doesn\'t do anything. I vomited anyway. The crash towards the end all seemed to start with me vomiting, so I\'m hoping once I get rid of that aspect the comedown will be less intense.    Well, have fun, and know what you\'re doing.    --B"
78156,Easter Therianthropes,kgao,"Jun 18, 2013",H.B. Woodrose & Herbal Ecstasy,"For the easter break I was keen to cut loose a bit from the daily grind and do some dancing and tripping. I have come to realise that if an experience is meant to befall me, it will find its own way of happening, no matter what my choices through space and time are. So I was not surprised to stumble upon a rave complete with psilocybin themed lectures occurring the very next day, just 2 hours away by train. That very same afternoon, a package I had ordered from an online retailer also arrived, containing a pack of 10 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, 4 amino-acid based herbal ecstasy tablets and some ayahausca ingredients (the latter were not part of this experience). A voice in my sleep (or was it my iPod?) once told me a coincidence is what you get when you apply a bad theory. So what else could I do than pack my swag and set off for the rave?    The day of lectures was very stimulating and thought provoking, the perfect way to prepare for a psychedelic experience. As the sun began to set I sat around a fire with strangers and enjoyed the atmosphere. At about 8pm I took one of the herbal ecstasy tablets. I have taken these many times before so new what to expect - a slow come-on followed by intense euphoria after about 2 hours. At the same time I could feel a cold coming on, but this wasn\'t going to dampen my spirit - although it ended up having a big effect on the trip. At 9pm the first DJ started playing, and I made my way into the main dance area and slowly began the ritual that is dance. I had been reading Graham Hancock\'s book \'Supernatural\' over the past few weeks, and had been inspired by the shamanic dances of the San bushman from South Africa where a trance state is entered and hallucinations encountered - apparently without psychotropic substances.  So I was keen to treat the dancing this night in a shamanic way (i.e. full-on, non-stop) and see what effect it would have on my trip.    After the first two DJ sets had finished (mild progressive-trance) I was feeling a nice buzz from the herbal e and went outside to drink the HBW concoction I had prepared the night before (ground 10 seeds, mixed with lemon and water), avoiding the cardio-active compounds in the sediment that had fallen to the bottom of the bottle. I sat by the fire some more for an hour or so until I started to feel the first rising notes of LSA entering whatever synapse it interacts with. As I heard the first beats of a dark-psytrance set started I quickly inhaled a small joint, and headed in for the experience. The music was amazing, synergizing with the rising energy of the trip and flowing through my body. I soon let go and submitted to the experience as I felt my grip on reality dissolve away from the substances and intense dancing. Time started to slow down, colours became brighter. Also, I felt like I was in telepathic contact with the DJ. If I would make a certain motion with my hand or face, I would look up a moment later to see the DJ mimicking the same motion. The bass line pummeled through my body and lifted my spirit higher and higher.    After this set, I went back outside. The trip was only just beginning I realised - either that or the dancing had amplified the effects many times. As I lay down on the ground with some crazy throat singing happening by the fire, I started to hallucinate. The hallucinations seemed much more overt than my previous LSA experiences, closer to LSD or psilocybin. The texture of rocks was an especially good canvas for the visions to unfold on. Maybe it was the book I had been reading that spurred my imagination, but I began to see rock paintings of what Graham Hancock refers to as therianthropres - half human, half animal hybrids - on the rocks. Millions of them - the smallest piece of moss or colouration in the rock would set off a cascade of bison-men floating through the rock ether. And then I had a revelation, a feeling, that I have only ever had on DMT - the absolutely clear knowledge that all time and space and consciousness is connected, everything is one. And a premonition befell me - that I should, and will, devote my life to the elucidation of the psychedelic experience. Next year I plan on beginning a course in ethnopharmacology - hold me to my word, dear friends.    I didn\'t sleep for another 16 hours, partly due to the stimulants I had taken and partly due to near psychotically enlightened state I found myself in. I must admit that at some points I was scared that the experience was becoming too intense and my sanity was at risk. I remember saying to myself - \'sobriety is such a precious thing\'. I think this paranoia may be induced by the cardio-active compounds in the HBW fuzz that seemed to be present despite my attempted filtration. I think in the future I will attempt a proper polar/non-polar extraction of LSA - the poisonous compounds in the seed coating really make the trip difficult.    This experience opened my eyes to the potential of plant-based LSD-like experiences.  It also presented me with many revelations, as mentioned about, plus another that I just remembered - morning glory seeds or LSA/LSD like compounds must have been used heavily by our pre-historic ancestors for such profound psychedelic effects to occur.  When I\'m in that state, it is obvious that my body and this compound have a very deep connection that runs far into the Paleolithic.      Peace, and happy tripping."
90000,Breaching the Space between the Opposites,Gooseus the Green,"Dec 10, 2012",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"My two rooomates and I decided to take a day off from our relatively busy schedules to go on a psychodelic trip.  They did acid at Coachella last year, but I didn\'t go and we couldn\'t find any acid or mushrooms that we could trust, but we stumbled upon Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds as a natural psychodelic that could be obtained legally and had reports of similar experiences.  We ordered 50 organic HBW seeds from a reputable online herbal supplier which were reported to be from Hawaii.  On the day of the trip we packed a bunch of picnic-type stuff up and went to Griffith Park on an awesome sunny March day.  We parked and prepared the concoction using the sub-lingual method.  We each took the dose of seeds we wanted (accounting for a reported 20% loss of potency due to the sublingual method when not swallowing seed matter), we crushed them up, mixed with a small amount of water, let the mixture sit for 5 minutes and then shot the mixture and held under our tongue for 30 minutes before spitting out the concoction.  I took 11 seeds (going for a 7-8 seed dose) and tried to pick out some of the husk, but gave up assuming that the husk would only become an issue if I swallowed it.  Before the 3 of us took the mixture we each recorded our intention for the trip... mine went something like this:  \'I intend to breach the space between this world and the next, to understand the space between the polar opposites that make up the Universe... and hopefully not freak the fuck out in the process\'  We\'ll come back to that, but let\'s just say that intention is a powerful thing... too bad my intention wasn\'t stronger on that last part.  So we walked up to the Observatory and hung out on the lawn while we were holding our seeds under the tongue (I was swallowing my saliva build-up, my roommates were not), after 30 minutes we spit them out and hung out on the lawn waiting, then hiked down a trail and bullshitted some.  My roommates became impatient waiting for the seeds to kick in and since we\'d read so many varying reports about dosages and methods, they began to scrape some more seeds to get the skin/husk off and just ingest them whole.  I abstained and decided to wait some more, I was mostly too lazy to scrape the seeds as it\'s a pain in the ass and my stomach was feeling a little cramped.  They each took 2 more seeds and we walked back up to the Observatory lawn where we lay down and just waited.  I napped for a little bit and when I woke up I felt none too different, just slightly loopy with a lack of inhibition.  It\'d been 2 hours since we had taken the seeds initially and none of us were tripping.  One of my roommates reported extreme lethargy and he began to appear somewhat drunk.  At this point I decided to take another 6 seeds, I crushed them up again and took them sub-lingually.  After 20 minutes of holding them under the tongue, I decided to just swallow the seed matter, figuring that if I puked, that was fine by me.  We waited around some more and then decided to go in to the Observatory.  My one roommate seemed kind of wasted and the other somewhat normal, though we both thought most things were pretty funny... something like a light alcohol buzz.  It was decided that the seeds were bullshit, we did it wrong, or perhaps... we needed to catalyze the experience with weed.  Having no weed, I decided I would drive us to my dispensary, pick up some good shit, then drive us home where we\'d just smoke and go see a movie.  So that\'s what we went to do.   [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    At this point, I\'d like to note that I have been a heavy marijuana smoker for many years and have done mushrooms on two occasions.  The first time was an awesome experience 7 years ago, but the second time (6 years ago) I ended up having a seizure which scared the shit out of me.  I also had another seizure 4 years ago, this time while just smoking weed... but both times were during a period of my life where I was under extreme mental and emotional anxiety and was much less secure with myself, I had previously chalked them up to panic-induced seizures caused by extreme anxiety.  I used to experience mild panic attacks while just smoking, but I haven\'t come close to a seizure or any sort of panic attack in the 3 years since moving to CA from NJ.  It\'s also of note, that at the time of this experience I had not smoked weed or done any other drugs for 4 weeks, I was totally clean going in to this.  So I drove us to my dispensary and picked up some bud (Blue Dream) and drove us home.  While driving I was experiencing some strange sensations and a generally carefree thought process, though I noted that my driving wasn\'t erratic and I was careful and able to get us there and back without any real trouble... definitely not sober though.  When we got home I got out my vaporizer, we sat around the table, packed it up and we passed it around.  I took 2 vapor hits and was instantly stoned.  I started telling a funny story about an iPhone app project that I might work on and in the process of explaining the application design, I suddenly saw the project design from multiple different angles, the project made sense as a complete whole and I could hold it all in my mind... I suddenly noticed I was not JUST stoned, I said so and suddenly I saw my ego speaking and thinking and was observing from a space outside of it and outside of everything, I saw my roommates egos and the interaction between us and realized that we were not just that.  I understood the patterns and understood myself, the Universe and the connections between them.  I started talking vaguely about it and felt that I needed to write because I understood something and I needed to put it down lest I lose it... I grabbed my laptop and wrote one sentence, then realized that writing was futile as the experience I was having could never been placed in to our feeble language, let alone flow quickly enough from my fingers.  One of my roommates saw that I was losing touch with reality and said something like \'Dude, don\'t go down the rabbit hole\'... so that\'s just what I did.  Last thing I remember is saying something like \'It all makes so much sense\'.  I woke up on the ground next to the table, I had a vision of having just gone to sleep and in the space between being conscious at the table and conscious on the floor I had a vision of a women (Goddess?) kiss me.  I remember saying something about wanting to nap, but really I just wanted to go back to that place.  It was peaceful and beautiful and I may have said something like that.  My roommates insisted that I go to the next room to nap, but they really just wanted me off the floor and in the other room (later my roommates said that I leaned forward, my eyes rolled up in to my head, I hummed a couple of times and slumped sideways out of my chair, one of them caught me so I didn\'t crash to the floor).  I lay on the couch, but they didn\'t want me to go to sleep.  I understood their fear and could see their concern for me... it was beautiful, I felt peace and understanding and I could see everything differently relative to that existential moment.  I told them that I\'d fulfilled my intention, I had seen how perfect the Universe was from the space between the opposites.  In/Out, Up/Down, Good/Bad, Self/Other, everything was a beautiful illusion, a game we create playing always between the two sides split from the beautiful Whole in countless dimensions.  I attempted to explain it and in trying to intellectualize it for my roommates, I saw them completely and myself... and then I got stuck spiraling around the rabbit hole.  I felt that they could have the Truth I had if they acknowledged that I had just died in the other room moments before and that it was ok to die at any time as it was all apart of the beautiful game of the Universe.  Just another oscillation between the opposites of Life and Death, nothing to fear and the fear of death was exactly what drives life.  In trying to intellectualize the Truth I had just experienced I found myself caught looping between acceptance of my own death and fear of my own death... love of life and a resistance to life.  I felt that I needed others to understand the Truth in order for me to keep it, but that the only way to give the Truth to others was to die in that moment.  Caught between the fear of dying before my friend\'s eyes and the acceptance of my own death through knowledge of the Truth about the beauty of death, I became increasinly manic.  I realized that I was stuck in a cycle of trying to intellectualize and communicate something that was not possible to be communicated or intellectualized, but compelled by a need to do so.  I felt a fear that the world would end because I had seen through the game that the Universe was playing and yet I realized that the Universe proceeded from me and in these moments I understood increasingly more and more about the game we all play in life.  I saw the origin of all religions and understood countless metaphors for what they were and the context which powered the spiritual (I had been reading Alan Watts and Joseph Campbell prior to this experience).  With each new understanding came a joy and wish to communicate it, I made my friends begin a recording which I felt would contain the Truth, but then became afraid that the Truth was that the recording couldn\'t contain it, we had to stop it and then felt that it needed to be published or else I would die...I began believing that maybe we would all die, and maybe the world would end because of the recording and the truth on it.  All this time my friends were trying to engage me in conversation, but my mind was working too fast, I\'d acknowledge or respond to a question, but would run off in another direction as something else occurred to me.  Everything made sense relative to my death experience and as I worked things out it became clear that my ego was trying desperately to protect itself from the Truth I\'d uncovered about it.  I felt the only way to get out of the spiral was to go to sleep, knowing full well that I might not wake up (yet knowing that I would because I had chosen to continue living before).  My roommates would not let me sleep and in the tension I would wrap back around to a manic state of insistence on certain truths.  They made me food and turned on a TV, hoping to distract me from the mental circles I was running in, I couldn\'t eat, I could only think.  Everything seemed futile for some moments, yet I accepted it as it was.  I felt like I had entered a Hell much like Sartre\'s No Exit and at times was convinced my rooommates would kill me because they couldn\'t understand my truth or that we would continue running in these inane circles forever.  At the same time I knew that if I could just calm down and allow life to be, my roommates would calm down and we\'d all go to sleep eventually.  After a time I realized that I had to calm my ego, I had to merely stop trying to explain and intellectualize the Truth as it was this impossible task that my ego had caught itself up in as a way of regaining control after it was lost.  I knew there was no way anybody would understand it since an experience is beyond true comprehension except to the person who has it...  in the true acceptance of one\'s death lies the experience of Truth of life and death.  After quieting myself, the Truth became internalized, I ate the food they had made me and we watched some TV.  After awhile we all went to sleep.  I woke up in the middle of the night and contemplated more thoughts on spirituality and religion... I felt forever changed.  I went back to sleep and had many dreams, a couple were lucid and I was able to fly and walk through walls in them (something I\'d never done in a lucid dream before).  I awoke the next morning and still felt I knew something others didn\'t really know, yet was something I\'d known intellectually all along.  Today is the second day since that experience and I feel similar, though I know that my ego is regaining more control.  It\'s ok, because the game of life is the only game there is and I know that what awaits me after I\'m done playing it is a beautiful reconciliation between the opposites that power our life.  Acceptance of Life, Resistance of Death Resistance of Life, Acceptance of Death  These are the poles that power the consciousness that plays the game... much like the Positive and Negative interactions between electrons and protons power the thermodynamics of the Universe we play in.  And there I go again trying to intellectualize...  I\'ll finish with a thought I had the morning after this experience:  Life is a process of Dying.  Death is a result of Life. So, I can Die my Life away or Live my Life to Death."
95704,What Love Really Is,LightSeeker,"Apr 15, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"The sun rose and I decided to take some Argyreia seeds which I had bought from a near gardener. It would be the first time that I was taking them, and so I was a little bit expectant about the coming trip.    I was, in the last days, thinking seriously about my relationship with my wife, with my relatives, with people in my family, and with God. Nothing was really bad in my life, but still there was a kind of lacking in my heart, a sense that I needed to do more than I was doing. So that was the primary reason for me to take this seeds: understand myself, and how should I associate with people.    7 a.m. I went outside, got in a nearby church, made my prayers and put 5 seeds (no outward layer) in my mouth, chewed them and let it there for nearly 20 min; then I went outside, spit half part and swallowed half.    Walking back home I started listening to some good interview on the radio  nausea was coming.    8:30 a.m.  Got home, my wife was working in a essay, I sad to her I was slightly sick, and then I went to bed.     With the passage of time my heartbeat was getting much faster then the usual; I could not focus in anything outside, and so I kept my eyes closed. There was no mood for introspection though  the agony and confusion in my mind was overwhelming.    10:30 a.m. I was suffering a lot in bed, impossible to rest, my wife kept helping, always coming by my side, giving me water and praying with me for this experience, which was turning itself into a nightmare, to go away. (Her love was inspiring!)    11:30 a.m. Tried to puke, nothing came out. I was constantly looking at the watch, eager for the time to pass quickly and let me out of this trouble. What did I do!!  I kept thinking with myself  if this keep on growing Im going to die!     I started to think that I had to purify my body quickly, so I began to drink lots of water.    12:30 a.m. I could not bear the suffering anymore... I felt I was collapsing. I could barely walk; I hadnt eat anything by then.    13:00. I started to feel a little better. Laying on the bed I contemplated, through the window, the clouds in the sky and enjoyed a slightly pleasant sensation... At this moment I could feel the blessing that my wife was to my life, and how her character was unsullied, and her personality angelical: Im grateful, my God.    However, this insight didnt last. Soon came some more discomfort  I was for sure still poisoned.    13:30. Suddenly I felt more at ease and I thought that I had already spent much time suffering in bed (more than 5 hours)  I decided to go outside for a walk.     Walking through the streets and seeing the trees in it was in fact very much pleasant, so I kept on walking. I felt delightful to see all things: objects and people.     However, I started feeling dizzy, my sight was becoming dark  I realized I was going to faint at any time. I ran inside a big department store on the corner hoping to get some fresh air through their air conditioner. I got in, sat on a bench, but the symptoms didnt went away.    15:30  I fell on the ground, almost unconscious; immediately came the police, they called to my wife, and she came along with more 3 friends... I could see nothing more...    17:00  I was in the hospital, and was starting to feel better. The events of that day was all I could think about. I felt the great love of my friends.    19:00  I came back home. I was breathing relief and gratitude again: I didnt die. If so I would have ruined everything and left behind the most loving parents, wife, kids... all of them in enormous agony.    For the next 3 days, due to side effects, I had virtually no sleep, with pressure and cardiac alterations.     At that moment I reflected that the real hero in life is he who has the courage to face all his great challenges without using drugs.    Well, I began this journey seeking a deeper understanding of my life; even though the psychedelic effect of the seeds had been buried under the awful intoxication, by the end of it all I ended up with the answers!    Realizing all the help and care I received that day (and in my whole life) I had a glimpse of what love really is."
67306,The Highest of Highs,Cameron,"Dec 5, 2011",H.B. Woodrose & Salvia divinorum,"I have little experience with tripping on Salvia, and no experience with tripping on LSD. I had developed a bit of control with my Salvia trips, so I thought I would take the leap of tripping for a great deal of time on a more powerful psychoactive drug.    I crushed ten seeds and chewed them for about two minutes at about 6:30 PM. Soon after, the first hour of my experience, I felt a warming sensation in my head. It was distinct enough to tell that this was not just wishful thinking, but that the seeds were doing something. During the course of that hour, ever so often I would feel a flash of what seemed like insanity for less than half of a second. From what I had heard about LSD experiences and the fact that LSA was very similar, I was expecting to have a very color and unique trip unlike anything I had ever experienced.     After a half hour or so of this warming sensation and brief glimpses of insanity, I thought I could help the LSA trip begin by using Salvia. I sat at my desk and inhaled too very deep breaths of Salvia, holding both breaths inside my lungs as long as I possibly could. In a matter of seconds I was a in a new mind. I was still in my room, the TV was still on the same program, and for the most part, everything in my room was how it should be. The only exception was that I felt the presense of many beings in the room. I didn\'t question their lack of body and voice, but rather I \'just\' knew they were there. These beings have appeared in other Salvia trips I\'ve had. I often speak to them, and when I\'m having a bad trip, I yell. When I\'m having a bad trip, I tell the beings that I\'m not going to give in and panic because panicing is what they want.    After I regained my normal state of mind, the warming sensation was gone, and I began to feel a bit of nausea. I called my friend with whom I\'ve previously used Salvia and told him of these effects I was feeling. They were mild, and I didn\'t have much to say. I still seemed intrigued, though, because I had mentioned the seeds\' capabilites in the past. So, concluding the conversation, he told me to call him if I felt anything more.     After about an hour or more of intense nausea, I started to experience a feeling of well being. At first I assumed I was only feeling good because the nausea was subsiding. I didn\'t want to lead myself on, thinking that the seeds were beginning to take effect. After about 20 minutes of this feeling intensifying I concluded that this was indeed effects from the seeds. This intense feeling lasted from about 9:00 PM until 3:00 AM. At the time, I remember thinking to myself \'euphoria, euphoria, euphoria.\' Although there were no visual hallucinations during this trip, my hearing became incredibly perceptive. There were three sounds in my room at the time: the TV, the ceiling fan, and the fan inside my laptop. I could hear each sound individually and incredibly accurately. Every so often the very suttlely volumed fan inside my laptop would stop running, and I would immediately take notice. The absense of this sound would make me feel completely different. My body seemed to keep releasing chemicals that heightened my mood, yet I felt 100% different.    At about 1:00 AM, I really wanted to go to sleep. My body felt completely drained of energy, and my eye lids were very heavy. I went to the bathroom before I attempted to go to sleep like I always do. My mind was completely clear at the time, but I walked and moved as if I were drunk. Stumbling along the way, I made it to the bathroom. I looked into the mirror, and my everlasting smile grew dramaticly. The green rings in my eyes were a very thin hair line, while the rest was clouded by a deep, black pupil. I laid my head down to rest, but realized that sleep was far from possible in spite of my incredible fatigue. My mind was racing. I couldn\'t control the presense of song, nor could I subdue the tapping of my fingers to the beat.    I began to grow frustrated with my active mind. I grew increasing worried that these euphoric feels would never cease, while at the same time I was still completely consumed in happiness. At about 2:00 AM the effects began to diminish, and I fell asleep a little after 3:00 AM. I was utterly exhausted, yet I laid in darkness for over two hours before falling asleep.    My trip was characterized soley by intense euphoria. Over the course of the six hours I thought about many things that would normally upset me, but my mood could not be altered. The smile on my face could not be wiped away. I tried many times to hold a straight face, but I could not succeed for more than ten seconds. I have had many good days through my life time, but no moment could compare to what I felt every second of this trip. This was a kind of happiness that could not be achieved with chemical induction.    One would think such an incredible experience would yield a hefty price. I felt no comedown of any kind the following day. The only price I paid was about $20 for 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Although I felt no visual hallucinations whatsoever like I had expected, I fully intend to repeat this experiment."
64868,How Not to Trip for the First Time,theo neon,"Sep 28, 2010",H.B. Woodrose & Alcohol,"Timothy Leary would slap me in the face if he heard this abortion of set and setting for my first entrance into psychedelia.    Set: I just started dating a girl and was pretty anxious about where it was going, I\'ve always been scared of psychedelics and didn\'t do anything to calm my nerves prior to the trip, I\'d recently been getting more pronounced paranoia from pot usage, I occasionally have anxiety episodes for no obvious reason, earlier my friend and I were having a conversation where I was arguing that humans only exist to further the cause of entropy.    Setting: 3:00am after a night of drinking, at my friend\'s tiny, institutional place, which is foreign to me and uninviting, it\'s freezing cold out and I\'m in an unfamiliar city, we have no chill music on hand, I\'d never even heard of hbw.    Prior drug use: plenty of pot and alcohol, one DXM experience (roboitchin\'), one cool nyquil/pot/alcohol synergy, one nitrous hit.    So my friend suddenly pulls out this bag of \'legal drugs\' he\'s collected. I\'m somewhat drunk and more than a little impressed with the mound of weird plants and seeds. He didn\'t have any pot and I\'d been in the mood for something besides booze. So when he proposed that we dip into the supply, I was intrigued. He showed me the hbw and said it was what he wanted to do (he\'d done it before and wanted to give it another shot). I\'d always wanted to trip, but never had the balls. Alcohol grew me a pair that day. After debating, we each grabbed about 5 seeds (low dose, I know, but I\'m a small guy and was uninitiated). We did nothing to prepare, just chomped away and began the wait. At this point I noticed my friend had a guitar. I figured wailing away for a while would be a good prep for the trip and that\'s just what I did. For about 45min-hour I slammed the strings, more frantically every minute, yelled things, knocked things over and eventually as the drug kicked in, started biting random objects and shouting heartfelt pleas for my friend to bang out a beat. Most of the playing was normal for me, especially infused with alcohol, but towards the end of the hour I began feeling a surge of energy that had nothing to do with booze.    As the trip began, I was immediately relieved. It felt strange like nothing before ever had, but it wasn\'t at all disturbing. In fact, I soon found in addition to the weird energy, there was an intense euphoria coming on. For about 30min-hour I babbled nonstop about how great the drug felt, how I never should have been afraid, etc. I then got an intense urge to share my mind with my friend. I wanted him to understand everything I ever knew and all my feeling. I especially wanted to talk about places we\'ve been together and how our perspectives were different. I talked about all kinds of things, including the negative aspects of life, but nothing bummed me out. I was ecstatic to be sharing and to view all my problems as insignificant and solvable. At this point, I figured I had reached the peak and was about to come down.    Then things got intense. First I went into a sort of meditation where I would feel on the edge of something: falling asleep, waking up, dying, enlightenment, god knows, but I\'d flinch and lose it at the last second. Then I snapped. I lost complete touch with reality. There was no hallucination. Everything around me was still there, but it was no longer real. I knew I was on a drug, but somehow that didn\'t explain enough. While I had no insight into the real nature of life, I did know that I could no longer continue with whatever this illusion is. For a while it was amazing. Until terror struck and I bolted into the cold night without shoes, socks or a jacket.    It took quite an effort to get me back inside. My mind alternated between viewing the apartment as safety or hell. Somehow between my running, 911 dialing and confused rambling my friend managed to give me the impression that his apartment was not confining me to the fucked up existence I\'d known previously. During the walk back, I felt a clarity, a stillness, a loneliness I\'ve experienced on more than one sober occasion since. It is beautiful and frightening and may be what I believed it to be. The rest was classic bad trip. I was already dead or in the process of dying, I was forever insane, I was in the womb waiting for rebirth, I was at my parents\' house hallucinating and could hear their voices vaguely through the madness, the tv discussed my death (actually saddam hussein\'s), my friend alternated between demon (complete with melting eyes) and angel. Meanwhile nausea struck causing me to spit constantly, triggering visions of \'actual reality\', a car accident and me on the side of the road spitting blood. My friend vomited, but was exceedingly calm considering my condition. The only positive aspect of this part of the trip was the intense closed eye patterns I saw. I knew if I could just get some sleep, I\'d feel better, but it wouldn\'t come.    The next day the comedown was in waves. Sober, then slightly tripping, then paranoia. I paced the city and moved with the flux. Eventually I felt relaxed enough to sleep. That was around 8:00pm. The drug itself had worn off by 2pm or so (about 11 hours after ingestion). Scattered memories: spitting out a large gulp of water I deemed poisoned, becoming a puddle of piss as I pissed, glowing textile patterns, realizing my friend and I had murdered the neighbor [no, not actually of course], visions of my aunt\'s house, trip dialing and leaving an extended message, pillow humping.    Don\'t take this as a condemnation of hbw. The drug packs a powerful head trip as advertised. Just be ready for it and plan properly."
77618,A Suprising ++++ Experience,Fluffun,"Jul 23, 2010",H. B. Woodrose & Anadenanthera peregrina,"In the past I have experimented with many different drugs and recently I discovered the Shulgin measurement scale. I came to realise that I have experienced two ++++ trips in my lifetime, my first was with mushrooms where I had a teacher experience, and came out of the trip far more enlightened about the nature of the human mind than I was before undertaking the dose.    That was nearly six years ago and is not so fresh in my memory, my second ++++ experience was last year, it is this trip I wish to detail in this report.    Around Febuary 2008 I had a phone call from a friend who had purchased some Anadenanthera Peregrina seeds from a reliable online vendor. He had absolutely no Idea how to prepare the seeds into a yopo snuff, so I kindly offered to help him having all the nesesscary ingredients powdered edible lime etc. I also brought with me to his house a large bag of HBW seeds which he had also, never tried. We took eight HBW seeds each and while they were taking effect we went about making the Yopo:     First I cooked all twelve of the seeds in a thick bottomed frying pan until the skin became cracked and blistered     Next we peeled the seeds and put the brittle, yellow interior into a pestle and ground them up as finely as possible.    I then added about half as much edible lime powder to ground seed.    I then wet fingers very slightly and rubbed the lime into the yopo, which I\'ve read converts the Bufotenine contained in the seeds to Bufotenate which crosses the blood/brain barrier more quickly.    After I had pressed the resulting mixture into a flat disk it was crushed again and left to dry.    We were beginning to feel the effects of the HBW seeds by this time and decided to retire upstairs to a quieter enviroment. We sat and talked for a bit a few small hits of salvia were had but not enough to cause any serious reaction, the trip off the seeds was mild and peaceful niether of us experienced any discomfort or nausea (I have done in the past and believe me, it was excruciating) and we stayed up into the small hours. Just before I went to bed I decided it would be a time to try some of the Yopo I had made earlier. My friend decided to abstain but urged me to try, the snuff was very dry and a light pale yellow, I chopped out a fat line and took it in one. I then ran to where I was sleeping and sat while the Yopo burned my sinuses.    Then I felt it, a little like the come up from salvia my vision started to fragment like seeing an image through a broken pane of glass, it steadily became stronger and stronger until the glass shattered sucking me through to the world beyond. I was completely incapacitated at that point and in my mind I was flying through a subspace. A complete, ever changing 3D world. It was the most vibrantly coloured place I have ever seen, there were objects beneath me but none were distinguishable, everything I looked at kept morphing and evolving as I tried to identify it (I tried opening my eyes at this point and the world was the same inside my head as it was outside, this was disturbing, the eyes remained shut)    I suddenly saw I was heading towards a tunnel which was completely dark within, looking back I should have been scared but something calmed me down, it was like someone was whispering in my ear saying \'don\'t be afraid, come with me, I am about to show you the most important thing you have ever seen\' I couldn\'t see this entity but I knew it was there and this comforted me greatly. As the tunnel drew closer I saw a shape within it floating and rotating within the confines of the tunnel as I drew closer it took on a more defined shape. It was a mandala huge and slowly rotating, it was the most beautiful thing that I ever have seen.     The mandala was divided into millions of segments and I marveled in it\'s beauty for a moment before I heard the voice again, it said \'look closely at me and tell me what you see\' it was the mandala talking to me and it had been all along, I looked into it\'s segments and saw my life. Not just things that represent my life but within each segment memories moving like a film or an image that meant something to me, I was invited into each one in turn and I experienced a fragmented shock of memory like a photo collage moving at a million miles per second, once this finished I witnessed the mandala one last time revolving and I came to a conclusion within the trip. This mandala was me, every facet of my life written on it\'s face, it was the most profound experience of my life. I had witnessed my own subconcious from it\'s vast painted interior. It was around this point that the visuals started to fade and I began to come out of the trip. It was about 7 in the morning and light I hadn\'t expelled the Yopo from my nose from the line and it was fucked for many weeks afterwards.     I have never touched Yopo since, mainly because it\'s such an inefficient and painful way to have a profound psychedelic experience, I had taken Yopo prepared in exactly the same way before experiencing only disorientation and flashing lights, niether of which were remarkably pleasant. And my friend who later tried some of the same snuff I had this experience from reported a sore nose and not much else. I was also stunned by my ability to recollect this experience as I made no notes immediately afterwards. This would be the first time I have ever shared it on paper. It will be forever imprinted on my mind."
84819,Starry Sky Upon My Eye,Triforce,"Jun 27, 2010","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Passion Flower","I\'ll start with the method: First I ordered several hundred HBWR seeds from a fairly reliable online source.  The seeds were a variety without the traditional Hawaiian \'fuzz\', but still had a considerable amount of husk-like bark attached to them.  However, seeing as my intention was not to directly eat/chew the seeds, I paid little mind to this.  The preparation was fairly simple.  Using my previous experiences as a guideline, I decided to do a cold-water extraction.  In the past, I had extracted around 30 seeds to the effect of a very low-dose entheogenic experience.  This time I decided to double the dose of seeds.    I individually crushed 60 seeds with a pair of pliers, saving all the crushed bits in a piece of paper.  When finished, I added the crushed seeds to around 1.5 oz\'s of cold water in a thermos.  I added a light squirt of lemon juice to lower the water\'s pH and thus aid in alkaloid extraction.  I left the thermos in the fridge overnight...for around 14 hours or so, shaking the thermos up pretty good every time I opened the fridge.  After soaking, I prepared another container by wrapping it in tin foil (to block light) and making a tin foil lid.  Then, with a fine wire-mesh strainer I strained out as much of the (now brownish) liquid, throwing away the seed pulp-mash when I was done.    These were my preparations, here is my experience:    Start time (t+ 0.00): I took one (1) dramamine tablet to help fight nausea down the road.    t+ 20mins: I added 2oz. brown LSA liquid to a tumbler glass with some of that Jumex Peach Nectar stuff (it\'s effin\' delicious).  Drank as quickly as possible (kind of a bad taste with the seed juice in there).    t+ 30mins:  Juice hits the stomach pretty hard....haven\'t eaten earlier so the nausea is twisting my stomach up into a little boiling cauldron....but it\'s nothing I can\'t handle.  I just need to lay around on the bed and take it easy.    t+ 1hr:  Nausea at a stable level, feeling sedated, tired, decided to smoke a little cannabis. Cannabis tokes take the edge of nausea, feel well enough to roam around the apartment, watching the edges of my sanity begin to recede.    t+ 1.5hrs:  Pupils beginning to dialate, thought patterns becoming more abstract, space and time beginning to feel less like reality, more like a dreamscape.  Still minimal, low level effects.    t+ 1.75hrs:  Get word that my best trippin buddy Herb O (nickname!) is comin\' over with his girlfriend.  Slightly worried because of my lack of energy.  Decide to drink some tea to settle the stomach.  Begin to boil water for tea.    t+ 2hrs:  Prepare and steep one cup of Nighty Night brand passionflower tea.  Tea contains medium dose of passionflower, hops, chamomile....bound to settle stomach.  Very much interested in effects of MAOIs, so add a good dropper-full of passionflower extract to the tea....kinda tastes like raisins.    t+2.25hrs:  Laying on bed waiting on Herb O and the girlfriend to arrive.  Suddenly, waves of physical pleasure wash over my body quickly, like power surges.  I am visibly surprised and startled.  Feels good, but happens several times in succession like \'bwoooop!\' power surge of good feeling.  Amazed, really.  About that time, Herb O and the g/f arrive and I excitedly tell them of the body surges.  Herb O decided to eat around 8 seeds....I tell him to go for it..    t+3hrs:  Trip steadily increasing....visual distortion barely started.  Still low level.  Body surges mysteriously gone.  Back to fatigue and dreamland thoughts.  Not bad....not strong either.    t+4hrs:  Herb O starting to feel effects from his seeds, meanwhile, visuals increasing.  MAOI influence perhaps?  Can\'t be sure.  We decide to ride down the elevator to have a cigarette downstairs in the fresh air.  While riding down the \'vator, I feel myself go up a level in intensity.  Elevator walls are shapeless, shifting mass of color and shape.  Imagine I see a silhouette of an extra person who isn\'t in the elevator with us for a second.  Laugh out loud. Upon return to upstairs, we drink another cup of tea together.    t+ 5hrs: Visuals dramatically increased. Patterns are an entire variety of shapes and colors and motion.  Very much like a strong hit or two of LSD.  Very satisfied.  Closed-eye-visuals are other worldly.  At one point, I close my eyes while sitting down and imagine, instantly, that my eyes never closed and instead, I am sitting on the ground in a huge field...the skies are overcast and stormy looking, the ground blowing around in a mosiac of colors and energy.  I cannot speak but to admire the beauty.    t+7hrs: Visuals go up another notch...did not expect this level of intensity.  While sitting in my bathroom, the entirety of my existence seems to be spinning around me like electrons around a nucleus.  Insanity.  Total explosion of visual effects: moving lines, blobs, animals, shapes, patterns......like being in a music video by The Knife or something.  Totally insane.  Without warning I suddenly start singing a totally made up song to my friends.  Something like \'OH! Starry Sky!  Upon my eye!  A world so true!  With stars like youuu!\'  I was imagining as if the universe had imprinted itself upon my eyeball.... :)     t+9hrs: Overly fatigued, visuals ebbing, only want sleep.  I crash out around 9 or 10 hours, Herb O and the g/f head home.  I slowly fall to sleep in a world still spinning within my moving-picture eyes.   Quite an amazing journey.      Summary:  60 seed extract of HBWR + cannabis + passionflower extract = more intense than ANY ACID I HAVE EVER TAKEN.  Nausea only predominant in first 2-3 hours, mostly brought on by extreme taste of the liquid extract.   When I have actually eaten the seeds by themselves, the nausea is less powerful but seems to carry over for the length of the trip.  In this way, the nausea may be stronger temporarily, but it seems to be completely gone by around hour 2 or so (roughly the same time the euphoric waves began zapping me like electricity).    An experience like this is perhaps among the most amazing Ive ever had.  Visually, this experience is WITHOUT A DOUBT the most intense thing Ive ever seen.  Makes acid look like baby stuff, no doubt.   Set and setting were very much in my favor: friends, good music, the comfort of my own home, no pressing tasks to attend to. The only drawback to the extract is that you need a larger amount of seeds to do the job.  The seeds I used are potent enough to induce a pretty intense trip if I eat around 9-10 plain.  As a rough dosing schedule I would offer this:    low level trip (mild nausea, visual distortions, fairly intense changes in thought patterns and closed eye visuals.  dreamlike quality.): 9-10 seeds eaten OR 30-35 seeds cold water extract.    medium level trip (nausea, fatigue, mild open eye visuals, very intense changes in perception and logic.  entheogenic quality.  otherworldly understanding of things.): 10-15 seeds eaten OR 35-45 seeds cold water extract.    high level entheogenic experience (nausea, fatigue, intense open eye visuals, total shifts in perception, sensory input, logical evaluation, total dissociate closed eye visuals, mind-blowing level of change in the general assembly and rules and makeup of the world and the universe.  possibly rather life-changing): 15-20 seeds eaten (extreme nausea!) OR (highly recommended) 45-65 seeds cold water extracted."
81774,The Infinite Mirror,Psychonaut,"Jun 13, 2010",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"As I write this, it\'s been approx 17 hours since my intake of the seeds and I still feel effects, (pretty out of it generally) I\'ll do the best I can to recollect what happened last night in detail.  About 9 o\'clock I arrive at a friends house, he has 3 other friends already over, I bring six H.B. Woodrose seeds. There already hitting a vaporizer, so I start grinding off that fuzzy shit around the seeds so we can get down to business. It will only be me and my friend tripping tonight, as theres only 6 seeds. At about 10 o\'clock me and friend \'N\' have had the seeds grinded up, chewed up, and in our mouths in a ball of saliva for 10 minutes and decide to swallow.  We wait about an hour and don\'t feel much. Within this time the two other friends have already left. It\'s just me and N now, downstairs in his garage sitting on couches. At about 1130-1200 I begin to feel it. It snuck up for sure, and we decide to start smoking some Mary, as its recommended to do so while on these due to the nausea associated with these little guys (I didn\'t get much anyways). By 12:30 I\'m totally tripping out.  This was such a new high to me I\'ve never experienced such effects in my life. I\'ve done shrooms tons of times, MDMA tons of times, etc. The LSA in these combined with Cannabis created a CRAZY euphoric trip. It felt as though a mix of the euphoria felt on MDMA was occurring with still a tripped out state of consciousness Id associate to shrooms. By 1:00 every mere thought or sentence I produce seems to bring about so much pleasure that I almost laugh every time I speak. My friend at this point does not know how to have regular conversation and every time I attempt to speak with him, his reply goes into a different context and different conversation.  I tried listening to music, and it was simply insane. My memory fades me really well at this point, but I specifically remember listening to music and saying I don\'t know how to express the sensory data thats being input into me right now. I literally could not comprehend it. From this point, EVERY thing that occurred was merely incomprehendable. Every thought, every sentence, was something I had no idea how to express to the point of breathing being a confusing concept.   I sat in the most mindless, tripped out state of consciousness and literally felt as though it was a burden to exist. At this point I decided the euphoric effects were gone and I\'d rather be unconscious than anything. I wanted to go home but I literally felt like I was flashing in and out of consciousness at the speed of light and getting up from the couch was an insane task. After reasoning with my friend for some time, I choose to drive home.  [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]   As I drive, I am looking around and trying to comprehend what I\'m doing. I feel as though my memory is fading so fast that every mere thought or image that comes into my head disappears within seconds and I am just doing my best to turn and drive safely. Again, my memory fades me here but I get home fine.  I walk inside, leaving half of my weed-butter-nuts in the car and any other important supplies just because at this point I feel so fucked that I cannot worry about anything but getting the fuck into a bed. I get inside, lock the door, walk downstairs and see my brother in the bathroom. He opens the door \'Yo you bring munchies?\' he said in the funniest tone, and I don\'t even remember how I replied but I feel as though I straight shut down his joke. I couldn\'t comprehend his attempt at humour and had no choice but to keep my mind on the goal (the bed) and if I didn\'t, I feared fainting on the spot. I get into bed, and now this is where I see what a bad trip can really be.   As I sit there, every negative thought merely multiplies by a million. Everything I think about reflects into another mirror of thought, and this goes in an infinite reflection resulting in instantaneous fear and sadness. As I sit in the bed, I slowly feel myself falling over into insanity. I cannot sit still but I cannot sit in my bed and pass out. All I want to do is be unconscious and my body will NOT let me. I\'m trying so hard to keep still and shut my eyes but with no success.  At this point its about 2:30 and I really begin to convince myself I\'m dying. The mere thought of this being a possibility goes into my head, hits the mirror of infinite fear and just EXPLODES. I am sitting there in my physical state, thinking what if theres something in these thats killing me right now because I think I\'m forgetting how to breathe. It was literally as though every negative thought I had, turned into an EXTREMELY negative thought (due to infinite mirror effect), then took its PHYSICAL equivalent in my body. So from this I would argue I was having the worse panic attack of my life. I was attempting to breathe, and it felt like breathing itself was of no use and was not helping me. It felt like my own fucking body was trying to suffocate itself.  I sat there and stopped breathing and literally felt relief begin to kick in. There mere concept of not bringing air into my body was helping me. At this point I\'m sure that this can\'t be a good thing, and THIS thought hits the mirror infinite fear and multiplies, making the trip worse. I\'m telling myself the best thing I can do is breathe steadily until I\'m fine. Time had literally no perception in me so what occurred with this attempt at steady breathing seemed like about an hour. I constantly panicked and moved around in my bed trying to breathe more and get more air, but still felt as though I was suffocating. I begin to try to puke but can\'t, still having trouble breathing, tears roll down my eyes and at this point I am truly thinking maybe its time to pick up my phone and dial 911.  I now understand why this has been done in a bad trip. I had convinced myself I was dying and I was physically feeling my own fear. I thought over and over again every time another intense panic resulted in the inability to breathe, whether I should start yelling my brothers name or call an ambulance. My friend had been texting me, I check my phone while panicking to see he says hes getting scared too. But probably not merely what I\'m feeling, as he did not say anything more than \'Yeah I\'m scared too\'. So I put my phone down and try to deal with myself and make clarity in whats really going on. Am I really dying? Is this actually happening?  Then my cat jumps on the bed.   In my worse state, the worse state I have ever felt in my entire life, I make one last attempt at gripping a safe reality. I pet my cat. As I\'m petting it, within what feels like seconds I begin to come down to reality in a much happier way. My body stops panicking, I feel breathing come more naturally, I can sit still longer.   I keep petting the cat. I begin to feel an absolute sense of love for everything. \'The bad trips over, and my fucking cat saved me. I love life. I love everything around me. I\'m so happy I can exist, eat food, have friends\' the list went on till I was giving thanks for merely everything that I could possibly give thanks for. I have never been more thankful of anything in my life. I was crying in happiness, I was tempted to go wake up my brother and tell him of what the fuck just happened.   After the cat leaves, I feel myself getting panicky again. My worst fear of slipping back into insanity grips me (and multiplies so I try to tell myself to be happy and see if that will multiply under the same laws as the mirror works. It does for what seems like a quarter second but then I feel as though my attempt at making myself happy was merely a cover up of my conscious state and this realization multiplied negatively. The panics ensued for only a few more minutes before I got control of it and passed out.   I wake up still feeling pretty out of it, but boy do those seeds hit you hard. I don\'t want to fuck with the mirror of infinity anymore, but if I do, I\'m bringing my cat for sure."
66107,Very Uncomfortable Night,anonymous,"Mar 9, 2010",H.B. Woodrose,"I had experimented with Woodrose seeds a few times prior to this. My first time I took 6 orally, and nothing much happened. The other times were with a sublingual technique, which created no effect. I was confident though, that this time would bring results. I should note that I have been diagnosed with a mild mental disorder, Asperger\'s Syndrome. This may have affected my experience in some way.    I start preparing the seeds, scraping the husk off each of them. It was a hard task, and took a long time. Eventually I settle with what I have, even though there is a fair bit of the brown coating still attached. I crush the seeds and soak them in bottled water for about 10 minutes.    At 9:25 PM I drink the water along with the seeds. Right after, I take 2 chewables of Pepto-Bismol. Nothing much to report for the next few hours except a placebo effect. After an hour I start to think nothing is going to happen, so I take a short bath. Afterwards, I go back into my room and watch television.    At around 10:45 I start to feel tired. I lay down on my bed for a while. I start to notice some nausea coming on. It\'s not too bad, but I fear it may escalate. I start debating whether I should smoke a bowl to ease the nausea, as I am feeling quite sedated and don\'t feel like getting up. I still don\'t notice any particular psychoactive effects at this point.    At 11:00 I decide to smoke. I pack half a bowl in my vaporizer. As soon as I finish it, I feel a high coming on. At first it feels like a normal cannabis high, but it quickly changes into something else. The nausea fades away. I feel strange. I realize that I have been sitting in my chair, staring at the tv in the same awkward position for the last 10 minutes, not moving a muscle. The state I\'m in is hard to explain. I start to feel uncomfortable at an escalating rate. Emotions pour over me. I suddenly feel very excited and anxious. I want to scream out in agony and bliss at the same time. Everything around me is incredibly confusing. I think I\'m losing my mind. I start thinking about how in the early LSD tests, the chemical was believed to induce temporary psychosis. I then ask myself if this is the case with LSA. I try and look at myself through outside eyes. I see myself, staring at a television, making blubbering noises which sound like laughing combined with weeping. I don\'t see any difference between me and someone who is mentally ill. I wouldn\'t mind so much, if I had been enjoying myself. But there was nothing good about this state of mind. As soon as it kicked in, all I could think of was getting out of it.    At 11:20, I get a bad pain coming from my stomach. I fear it\'s related to nausea. I decide to seek comfort in my bed again. The pain goes away, but I am still uncomfortable. After a number of minutes lying in the same position, I am overwhelmed by an odd feeling. My muscles seem to be tightening. I am laying in somewhat of a fetal position, and my arms and legs seem to be tightening inward. This intensifies, and I am not sure what to think of it. It is not painful, so I don\'t worry. Soon after, my body starts to feel quite large. It seems like I am able to feel an extension of my body. I attribute this to being aware of my aura. It is a few inches high. After a few minutes, this sensation leaves.    After this, time becomes vague. I remember looking at the clock in the hour of 12:00 AM. I continue to lay in my bed, watching television. Occasionally something will happen that makes me laugh in odd ways, which causes me to question whether that was really me who laughed. I am still very uncomfortable. Even though I\'m very tired, I know I will not be able to sleep for a few hours still. I want to get out of bed and get my mind on other things, but I am too very sedated to use much energy. I toss and turn. Nausea starts to set in again. This time, moderately strong. I breathe deeply to keep from making it worse. My breathing soon becomes very heavy. I look at the clock and it\'s suddenly 2:00 AM! I had lost track of two hours. It had seemed like time almost jumped ahead while I wasn\'t looking. The rest of the night continues in this pattern. Suddenly it\'s 5:00 AM. I may have fallen asleep before now, because it feels like I just came to. I feel considerably less uncomfortable. I quickly go to the bathroom to take the piss I\'ve been holding in all night. My pupils look to be their normal size. I go back to bed right after this, and fall asleep quickly.    I continue waking up in short intervals throughout the morning. The two hour time jump happens again between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM. At this time I still feel the strong effects of the night before. Still very sedated. Still feeling insane. But it is fading. As I type this, it is close to 6:00 PM of the same day. The feelings from the morning are still here. I\'m in a groggy, sickly state. I\'m sure I will be better tomorrow. I\'m likely never doing LSA again, as there was nothing enjoyable of it."
78541,"Euphoria, Love and a New Appreciation for Life",Weekend Warrior,"Jan 20, 2010","Herbal Ecstasy (Morning Glory, H.B. Woodrose & Guarana) & Cannabis","Background:  I never expected that a herbal pill could give me one of the most intense, spiritual and euphoric experiences of my life - which is exactly what my first experience with LSA gave me. First off, a little history about me - I am a 25 year old male who ever since discovering alcohol when I was 14, have had a fascination with mind altering substances and the power they have to change our perceptions of life & reality. I am very experienced with marijuana (which is and always has been my favourite chill out drug) and was a daily toker for 7 or so years. I have also done magic mushrooms (once, and a very frightening trip that was!), MDMA, cocaine, various opiates, kratom (my new daily drug of choice), mephedrone, methylone and various other RC\'s.    The trip:  Prior to this experience, I had planned to do LSA for several weeks beforehand in the hope of gaining a different perspective on my life and to try and discover new reasons for my existence. I was at home in my bedroom on a lazy Saturday afternoon and the perfect opportunity for me to test out these new pills that I acquired a week earlier. My mindset was neutral. I decided to trip alone so I could fully focus on my thoughts and avoid distractions from other people. The pills were a blend of morning glory seeds, hawaiian baby woodrose and guarana - all blended together in gelatin capsules, in a blister pack of 10 pills. The packet advised to take 3 or 4 pills for a strong experience but I decided to take 5 of them on a completely empty stomach. I consumed the 5 pills at 12pm with a bottle of water and layed down on my bed watching tv for about 30 minutes eagerly awaiting for the trip to begin. Shortly after this, I realised I only had 2 cigarettes left so I had to walk to the shops to get another packet.    On the way to the shops (T+1 hour at this point), I noticed subtle changes in my body - my legs became heavier and it felt like I had steel weights attached to my trainers, walking became more sluggish and my vision became fuzzier (similar to being stoned with that tunnel vision feeling). After reaching the shops and buying my cigarettes the effects started to intesify - walking required even more effort and I started seeing ripples in the pavement and buildings appeared to be breathing slightly. Then my stomach started to ache and a nauseous feeling swept over me, I began to get a bit anxious at this point as I still had a good 20 minutes to walk until I got home and was worried I might collapse because my body felt so heavy! Eventually I made it to my front door and the nausea was still increasing as well as the rippling effects of everything I looked at, so I dragged myself up to my bedroom and collapsed onto my bed.    I knew that cannabis would help with the nausea so I rolled myself a nice fat joint of potent weed and after smoking it (T+90 mis), the high was very different to what I usually experience. At first I lay on my bed with intense stomach pains and diziness - feeling like I wanted all this too end and that these pills were a waste of money. However, about 20 minutes later the nausea started to gradually fade away and a warm euphoria started to grow - it began to build in my stomach and continued to spread outwards through my body, all the while gaining in intensity (it felt very similar to an mdma comeup but a lot slower and gradual). The best way I can describe it was like a small warm balloon of euphoria slowly inflating in my stomach until it spread throughout my whole body and finally to my mind. My bodyload decreased immensely, going from feeling like I weighed a 1000lbs to feeling as light as a feather.    Then whack! I jumped off of my bed and this extremely intense feeling of pure bliss and peace swept through my whole being. If there was heaven on earth, this is exactly how I would imagine it to feel. I then started having racing thoughts about all the people I have in my life (from my past and present) and how much I truly love and value them, especially my parents. An amazing feeling of emapthy came over me and I had the feeling that we as human beings are all somehow connected to each other and deep down, we are all the same. I came to the realisation that happiness is inside each and everyone of us and it is up to to every person to find it, and that I would help everyone I know and love to reach this level of happiness I was experiencing.    I then looked in my mirror to see how I looked in this magical state and my eyes were extremely dilated, pretty much all black! I saw myself very differently as well, like truly looking at myself for the first ever time. When I stared deep into my eyes I felt a strong love and empathy for myself, I started thinking about all the good deeds I\'ve done over the years for people I love and then started to cry. I am a perfectionist and have been known to be very hard on myself if I don\'t handle a situation the \'right\' way and doesn\'t live up to my expectations. These weren\'t tears of sadness though, more so tears of appreciation for being given the gift of life, for my existence and being able to experience this state of sheer euphoric bliss. I then vowed that I would stop being so hard on myself and that I\'m only human like everyone else.    Shortly after this I decided to celebrate my new found realisations by mixing on my decks, playing upbeat, funky euphoric house which continued to heighten my feelings of happiness and newly found love of life. While mixing, I danced like I\'ve never danced before and every beat felt as though it was apart of me, traveling in and out of my body and everything just felt perfect. I was truly living in the moment. After about an hour or so of mixing (T+3.5 hours) I started to come down very gradually and the euphoria faded slowly. I still felt at great peace with myself and the world and decided to finish the journey off with another joint to ease myself back into the real world and think about what I had just experienced.    In summary, LSA gave me a euphoric, legal & effective trip. It helped me out greatly in allowing me to find a new level of peace within myself and there was a positive afterglow for the next few days after the trip, I was in a very good mood and mindset for a good few weeks after the experience. If I do this again I will make sure to have some cannabis for the nausea because if I didn\'t smoke that first joint this may well have been a very different trip and I might have posted this in the bad trip section!"
69547,Infinity and the Soul Eater,Anonymous,"Jan 19, 2010",H.B. Woodrose,"I would like to submit this information because I feel the current information listed concerning LSA is quite limited. I hope the following can be used to make the LSA database more useful to anyone thinking about trying it. I have had experiences with cannabis, salvia, LSD, possibly Bromo-Dragonfly sold under the guise of LSD, H.B. Woodrose Seeds, and now LSA extract.    First, I will describe the process I followed to extract the LSA. I had planned to make enough extract for myself and a friend of mine that would be visiting. My friend has also experienced the same drugs as I, plus mushrooms and coke and he is about the same weight as me. I started about a week before to allow myself enough time to perform the process. Using 20 H.B. Woodrose seeds ordered from an internet site (planning to split the produced extract in half between myself and my friend), I let the seeds soak in water for a minute or two and then I began scraping the outer husk off with a nail file. Once the seeds were scraped to mostly a tan color and dried, I ground them up in a coffee grinder. The ground-up seeds were then placed in Coleman Camp Fuel in plastic cups for three days, shaking multiple times a day. Each plastic cup would only last about a day before beginning to deform and at that point the mixture would be moved to another plastic cup, each time losing a very small amount of seed chunks. The solution also began to take on a red color after being placed in a red plastic cup.    So after three days, the seed mush was filtered from the Coleman fuel via coffee filters and the fuel was discarded. After being allowed to evaporate until the next morning, the seed mush was put in solution in another plastic cup in 80-proof vodka. This was allowed to sit for three days, shaking multiple times every day. No deformations on the plastic cup formed as a result of the vodka-seeds solution. At the end of three days, the seed mush was filtered from the vodka via coffee grinders. Additional vodka was poured over the filter and seed mush two more times on that day to attempt to pull out more LSAs. The seed mush was then discarded and the brownish vodka solution kept. The brown solution was poured into a flat pan and I placed the flat pan in dark cabinet at room temperature where it sat for two days before all of the liquid had evaporated, leaving behind a gooey dark brown substance, presumably the LSA and most likely a few other impurities. The pan was the covered with plastic wrap and let sit for another two days until we were ready to ingest it.    Now I will explain the set and setting of the trip and then go into the trips details. My friend had arrived a few days before and we had been partying and having a good weekend. It was Saturday night and we had originally planned to take the LSA on Sunday in the morning for a day trip, but when my friend noticed I was getting tired he suggested that we take the seeds that night and then I would no longer be sleepy. I agreed and we split the LSA goo in half and each licked up our halves using our fingers. Now remember the LSA was produced from 20 seeds. I chose that because 10 seeds I figured was an average trip and so I falsely assumed the LSA produced would be enough for us both to have an average trip or less since LSA is lost during the extraction. I assumed this because the week before I had chewed 10 H.B. Woodrose seeds and the onset was about 20 minutes and the trip was very pleasant.    I also falsely assumed that the LSA extract would have the same onset timing as when the seeds are chewed. After waiting 40 minutes with no noticeable effects, I assumed that I had failed at the extraction, having never tried such a thing before and not having confidence in my chemistry skills. So we then decided to chew a backup store of H.B. Woodrose seeds which had been scraped and placed in 80-proof vodka three days before. The backup store consisted of 7 seeds each. So now in total we each had ingested 10 seeds worth of LSA extract plus 7 chewed seeds. Now I would like to revert to a timeline starting with the ingestions already described above in greater detail.    0:00  LSA goo is ingested by me and my friend at approximately 8:00pm    0:40  After no effects, 7 H.B. Woodrose seeds are additionally ingested by the two of us, and we head off to a hookah bar with two other friends.    0:50  Arrival at hookah bar, atmosphere is darker than expected, not an effect of the drugs.    1:20  Minor visuals reported by myself and my friend. I am feeling disappointment and feel that the trip is going to be very boring or almost non-existent. Visuals include light beams from all lights and auras. My friend reported bending of some objects.     1:30  Visuals have not changed much. Seems like the two of us are talking a lot, thoughts are flowing faster. Eyes are becoming dilated.    1:40  Friend is hanging head low and appears to be heading in a negative direction. My visuals are still quite unimpressive but my mind is still rising. I feel very strong waves washing over my head that are extremely intense compared to the waves I felt on only 10 chewed seeds. I tell the other friends that we need to leave immediately when I sense my friend is stressing.    1:50  We get back to campus and walking back to the dorm room feels stressful. Four flights of stairs are climbed to get to my floor and they feel very long. Visuals are getting more intense. In the hallway, strange colors are all around and it is very bright.    1:55  In the dorm room it is also very bright. We eat lots of Cheetos and peanuts to try to increase the mood.    2:10 - My friend stops eating and is again falling deep into a bad trip and keeps his head very low. He is speaking of his bad trip to me and my roommate. (The other friend has left). My visuals are very enjoyable as I try to comfort my friend.    2:15  My friend feels he is going to throw-up, I tell him it is a good idea and that people always feel better after doing so. I accompany him to the floor bathroom where there are a few others around but not getting involved. He cant throw up and we return to the room, back at the room he feels it again, but again cannot throw-up and so we head back to the room.    ****My sense of time is becoming quite distorted by now****    2:25  I suggest talking about the good times will bring my friend out of his bad trip and he perks up immediately and agrees. We start with a few good times but my mind keeps getting distracted by the visuals and by the thought of sleep. Whenever we stop talking about the good times for more than a few seconds, my friend immediately falls back into his bad trip and hangs his head low.    2:40  The dorm room is really getting to my friend. He is experiencing many negative things like: he feels my bed is trying to eat him, he keeps going under it subconsciously and one time under it he feels like it is a coffin. He wants to go outside into nature to calm down and try to throw-up there.    2:45 - I take him outside to a secluded wooded area not too far from my dorm (my dorm is still in view about 100 yards away). We sit in the dirt among the trees in a dark area. My friend says that it is helping to calm him down. He tries to throw-up but still cannot.    2:50  My visuals are extremely intense. More intense than any visuals I have ever had before, including visuals from 2 gel tabs of LSD. My friend later says that his visuals and thoughts are also more intense than ever before, including a time when he ate 30 liberty caps. My visuals are: light appears to be shooting all throughout the dark woods, the weeds and plants all around me look like an oil painting and appear to be vibrating extremely fast.    3:00  My friend says that he is getting cold and nature is no longer helping him, so we head back to the dorm. My friend makes me promise to him that I am real. He believes that he is a figment of someone elses dream and that when that person wakes up he will disappear from existence.    3:05  My dorm room is brighter than ever. We try talking about the good times again. My mind is racing faster than ever and I am still contemplating sleep. My friend picks up a guitar with his mind and moves it around in his hand. The ceiling of my dorm is moving and separating into many colors very quickly, I am still enjoying these visuals.    3:15 - My roommate begins falling asleep (he is exhausted from very little sleep the night before as am I). I am beginning to fall sleep on the floor. My friend notices my eyes roll back into my head and is freaking out. My friend pleads me to stay awake and I begin speaking very strangely slow, almost like a robot, telling him that I cant stay awake.    3:25  My friend begins typing frantically on my computer. I move onto my bed and I hear him typing it seems like at lightning speed, I assumed he could only be typing gibberish like: adhkhsdfjl.    ****The following time frame is extremely distorted, because I am not sure how long I fell asleep for and during this part, the experience felt like an eternity, I cant even give an estimation****    4:00+  I am suddenly awake but my eyes are closed and I am trying to fall asleep again. I couldnt fall asleep and all I see pure blackness except for a gigantic silver infinity sign with a shiny white sliver racing along it like a racetrack. The sign is accompanied with a strange deep reverberating hum. I try to get the sign out of my mind and realize I cant, I am pleading out loud for help from God to save me from the horror I was feeling and I then begin convulsing on my bed. I can still here my friend frantically typing, not saying a word.    I opened my eyes and the room was terrifyingly bright, I felt like I was a subject on an alien space ship lab room. I closed my eyes again and could only see infinity. I was still convulsing and speaking like a robot for help and my friend was still typing and my roommate wasnt waking up. I wanted to go to sleep to try to sleep the effects off but all I could do was keep going through it. I thought the LSA I had made would make me convulse forever and my friend would be frantically typing forever. I thought I was stuck in a single minute for the rest of eternity. I had very real flash-forwards that someone had come into the room and called an ambulance and that I had ridden the ambulance to a very bright emergency room in a hospital and that I was endlessly convulsing in front of all of the people I loved, my parents and family and friends, and especially people that I respected whom I thought would be disappointed in me for doing drugs.    Jumping out of my window to end it all crossed my mind and I became really scared when I actually thought about that and I felt like I had to keep control of myself so I wouldnt do it. I made sure to not get out of my bed for fear that I would try to jump out the window. It was the most terrifying and traumatic experience of my life. It felt like it lasted for hours. I continued convulsing and my friend kept typing. I know I eventually fell asleep only because I woke up in the morning at approximately 11:00 am.    15:00  My thoughts and visuals had calmed noticeably. I was no longer convulsing and I was immediately thankful to be alive. I quickly checked on my friend and he said he was OK and had a major headache. I felt very sore but had no headache. I was still tripping but much more controllably and felt much closer to reality. I was more thankful than ever before to be back in sight of reality.     Epilogue    We went back to sleep for a few more hours and later began slowly to get up and start enjoying a new day in a lovely reality. My friend showed me what he had written during his experience, it was not gibberish at all but a very in-depth relation of the experience as it was happening and it was very rhythmic. He said the words were coming out automatically, without any trying at all. He said he was typing to try to calm down. His experience was with something he dubbed the Soul Eater, a dark black cloud he says he had seen during the course of the night. He also wrote thoughts all over numerous pieces of computer paper and waved them in the air with a weary laugh, dubbing them souvenirs from Hell. Other interesting parts of his trip were that he could feel the words he typed. He said that when he wrote ice that the room turned blue and he felt cold, and when he wrote fire the room turned red and became hot. He said he saw demons all over the room the experience was also the worst, most terrifying and traumatic experience of his life.    End Notes    I hope the latter will contribute to the making especially of an Effects page for LSA. I definitely blame my own irresponsibility for the above trip, but a little more organized information might save someone else from making the same mistake I did when I chewed the seeds after ingesting the LSA. Also, it might help to portray the potency of LSA more accurately, as I did not expect a trip heavier than LSD because LSA is less potent, I was tripping harder than on a normal dose of LSD. I would recommend the onset for LSA based on this trip is approximately 1:30 to 2:00 hours, the peak comes on really fast from the onset, taking about 30 minutes to max out and lasting for about 5:00 hours. Comedown lasts approximately 5 to 6 hours. After effects (slight movement trails, slightly strange colors and feelings) last about 24 hours."
61127,Hawaiian Baby. Huh? Lucid Nations,jellyman,"Nov 8, 2009",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"After several very positive experiences with LSD, psilocibin and MDMA, I decided it was time to further expand my horizons. Ideally, this would have been done with more acid, but it can be extremely hard to get my hands on, and both my efforts and those of my friends had met with little success in that regard. With all of our local access points exhausted, we decided to seek out alternatives. What we found, after some searching, was the ingestion of Morning Glory seeds.    After doing some searching on the intar-webs, we discovered that HBWR seeds would be a more potent, and hopefully safer choice. My first experience involved myself and two other friends, *R and *J.  My good friend *S brought down the seeds from his house up north (we had ordered them online) and we decided that a random thursday over Feb. break was a choice time for our experience. *S brought the seeds, and I looked up various preparation methods. What I decided to go with was grinding the seeds (without shucking them) and soaking them in water for a period of time, then filtering out the seed material and drinking the water. I bought 6 bottles of Lemon Flavored Dasani, and proceeded to make 6 bottles of \'tea\' (no heating was used). I set two bottles aside, one with a dose of 15 seeds, and one with a dose of 8. These will play a large role later.     Having the most experience with hallucinogens in my friend group, I wanted to take the strongest dose, using myself as the guinea pig. However, my intentions weren\'t purely altruistic, I also wanted a really strong trip. I put 12 seeds in my bottle, and 5 in the bottles of my companions. The seeds soaked in a cool and unlit drawer (LSD can be affected by light and heat, I have no idea what effect it would have on the chemicals in HBWR) for about 3 hours before my trip-buddies arrived. After using coffee filters to get out the seed material, we all started drinking this stuff, which wasn\'t unpleasant tasting (due to the lemon flavoring).     At about 15 minutes into it, I started to feel the onset of a headache. This faded quickly. Nausea also came and went rapidly, never getting bad enough to induce vomiting. R and I took dramamine just in case symptoms came back. After about an hour, a very pleasant high started to kick in. The high was very tactile, and was accompanied by a very strong sense of euphoria. We decided smoking would be a fantastic idea at this point, and boy, we were right. After getting high, the euphoria intensified, and we wandered around. For me, the experience was very akin to low doses of LSD-25 that I had taken in the past. The experience was focused, mellow, and enjoyable, with subtle visuals and next to no actual hallucinations.    Four days later, the real trip happened. A friend of mine, P, wanted to trip after I told him about the seeds. Excited to experiment again, I told him I already had two bottles prepared. Bringing them over at about 9 pm, I drank most of the bottle of 15 seeds, while he tackled his bottle of 8, and the last 1/4 of mine. After a brief bout (maybe 20 minutes of watching tv and feeling poopy)with nausea, we both felt the onset of the same euphoric high I had experienced before. Wanting to emulate my last trip, I suggested getting high. We did just that, smoking a large bowl. We were completely unprepared for what was coming next.    Waiting for my former (and P\'s current) roommate to arrive so we could smoke (again) with him, we sat down to listen to some music. By this point, about an hour had passed, and we were experiencing mild visual distortions. We turned out the lights, and listened to some tunes while we waited for *D to arrive. Time passed quickly and slowly at the same time, and before we both knew it, we were tripping incredibly hard. D came in, and saw we were tripping, and turned up the music. All of a sudden I lost control of what I was seeing, and the most fantastic set of cartoonish visuals I have ever seen played before my eyes. P had a similar experience. We smoked a little with D, and at this point I was tripping much much harder than I had expected. A feeling akin to the loss of control that comes with drinking too much was taking over my mind, and I was saying things that I normally would have kept private, commenting on how I looked in the mirror, etc. My eyes and ears were red from smoking, and as I watched myself, my ears elongated and stretched to a point, and my eyes and mouth began pouring fire out of them. I became the devil for a few moments, then reverted to my human form. I thought this was incredible, and laughed loudly about it.     Visuals were uncontrollable and potent at this point. My perspective was shifting in wonderful ways, with my hands being the size of mountains. I was a giant among men, and nothing could stop me. I could have leapt over a building if I wanted to, and I was enjoying myself immensely. This was the most powerful experience I have ever had, even more so than 4 hits of LSD. My pupils took up my entire iris, and I couldn\'t stop grinning like a madman. I began to feel increasingly introverted, and looking back, it\'s due to the presence of someone who wasn\'t tripping (D). I was overcome with the urge to go back to my room and finish the trip alone, so I tried to leave. All of a sudden, nausea hit me with the all the force it could muster. I made it to the bathroom, and threw up once. Cleaning up, I realized I felt incredibly better. In fact, even vomiting hadn\'t been that unpleasant. I washed up and left D and P, and went back to my room. What followed was a wonderful talk with some old friends, musical enjoyment, and the trippiest session of mariokart 64 in the history of mankind.    The night was fantastic, and my trip wasnt even half done. I lay in bed tripping silently from about 2 until 7 in the morning, then fell asleep until about noon. Realizing I had to get to class, I got out of bed, only to realize I was STILL tripping! It was very mild, but if I focused on the visuals, I could increase their potency and induce a peak. I continued to trip on and off, with lessening frequency and intensity, until 7 that night. In my Bio class, we were watching pictures of Monkeys and talking about primate evolution. The monkeys would look at me, get up, and walk around the projection screen. It was incredible. Going to bed that night, I had incredibly vivid and memorable dreams, and they have continued since then (it has now been 4 days). Waking up the next day, I felt nearly normal. P wasnt so lucky. He had a bad trip after I left, since he was unprepared for what was coming and had no-one as crazy as he was to relate to. He only started feeling better yesterday.     Why was my trip so powerful this time? I think its because the seeds had soaked in water for 4 days before the trip. Every account I have read online involves soaking the seeds in about a shotglass of water or alcohol to minimize the amount of liquid you have to drink, my theory is that this limits the potency of the trip. Water can only hold so much of a chemical before it becomes supersaturated with it, and no more will dissolve into the water. By using entire bottles of water, and allowing for such a long period of saturation, it allowed that much more LSA to leech into the liquid. I made several more bottles and I plan on revisiting the land of giantism and euphoria tomorrow.    Some personal suggestions:    Use the method I did for extraction. It works wonders.  Start with small doses unless you have lots of experience with hallucinogens. P wasn\'t ready for what occurred, and it freaked him out badly, ruining his trip. Besides, it\'s easy to take more, hard to take less.    Trip away from sober people. I can\'t stress this enough. Being around sober people brought me down every time it happened, because I felt so awkward and out of control. Stay with people who are on similar doses as you, or trip alone.    If your trip turns sour (mentally) it is due to your state of mind, not the drug! You can fix it, too! Do something you love, and it will bring you back to a wonderful place. Watch a good happy movie, play great music, etc.    This is not a party drug. Being in public may get you in trouble, because the pupils become largely dilated, and judgement becomes questionable.     Avoid anything remotely dangerous. I got lost in the woods during my first trip (and this was the weak one!), and was so tired I almost fell asleep in the snow, which would have been bad. I also was trespassing in neighbor\'s yards, and I\'m lucky I wasn\'t arrested.    These seeds DO contain poisonous, nauseating chemicals. Don\'t overdose, and be careful in dosing. The best way to avoid that, it seems, is to start with low doses and work your way up, and to not eat the seed material. I still got sick just from drinking the water!    Have fun!"
66317,The Natural Acid,0 Time,"Oct 20, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"Ive recently begun working with entheogens again after a long hiatus.  This time around I wanted to approach them in a manner that was scientific, psychotherapeutic, and spiritual.  The spiritual element was never lacking before, but a laze faire approach really prevented me from doing any really deep work with them.  As I am also doing various consciousness experiments, Id selected specific psychotropic plants to use, although not specifically for specific reasons.  However, Ive always wanted to try LSA containing plants, or seeds rather, for their close chemical relationship to LSD which has been very valuable to me in the past.  For this purpose I employed Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds as they were very easily attainable via mail order companies.    I was in the midst of a busy weekend so I had to do several things in the midst of preparing to do the Woodrose seeds.  Id read in a book about how the shamans in Mexico would grind Morning Glory seeds down, macerate them in water, and strain them in order to take them.  Since, as Id read, the nausea inducing part of the seeds is in the skin, I decided that the Mexican way is the best way.  Before going to bed on Friday the 5th of October, I smashed up five seeds (0.45 grams), gathered them up into a small filter, and tied it up with dental floss, rendering them into a teabag.  I then warmed up some water, but did not bring it anywhere near a boil, and put them into a mason jar that I tucked away into the cupboard.  The following morning I transferred it to the refrigerator where it would stay until that night.    I had to go to dinner that night with some co-workers from Burma and my girlfriend.  Feeling wary of the potentially nauseating effects of the seeds, I ate as lightly as I could short of offending my Burmese hosts.  My girlfriend and I returned home at about 9:30 pm.  Not wanting to chance any nausea, I waited until about midnight before drinking the decoction.  I also picked some fresh peppermint leaves from my garden in preparation.  I briefly prayed to the Universe, the Earth, and the Woodrose spirit itself before drinking the tea.  Both my girlfriend and I were very tired so I only drank about 2/3rds of the decoction.    I was nearly stunned as I began feeling it within 15 minutes of drinking it.  I was feeling much energized, despite my body feeling ragged.  I thought naively, Oh, Ill just go to sleep on this stuff, no big deal.  Its only a medium dose.  Ill just have some colorful dreams.    Ha, ha.  I started feeling very cold- despite it being 80 degrees in the house- so I put on a sweater, pants, the works, and crawled into bed.  Not even two minutes into lying there, I started having heart palpitations.  This concerned me, so I sat upright.  Then I thought it would feel good to lie on my stomach on the floor.  Apologizing to my girlfriend, I got up and got a comforter and a pillow, and lay on my stomach on the floor.  This only lasted about two minutes before I leapt up and went into the living room.  The paradox of my cold body and racing heart had me pacing about the living room.    I found myself seized with myriad impulses to touch and feel different things.  First, I wanted to lie on the floor\x85 then rub the right side of my face on the carpet\x85 then go outside to smoke my tobacco pipe.  I was restlessly rolling around on the floor and couches for about a half an hour.  Wanting to sleep, I thought Id drink lots of water and flush my system out.  At this point it was around 1 a.m. and I found myself clock watching.  Time slowed to a crawl.  I found myself doing crazy modern dance like moves for what seemed like ten minutes at a time only to see that only two or three minutes had elapsed.      I had calmed myself down by then, even though my deep breathing was interspersed with sighs.  I tried closing my eyes to see what the closed eye visuals were like and quickly found myself being suck into an otherworldly dream.  Not feeling ready for that, I decided to pace around in the basement.  By now, my open eye visuals resembled a small dose of LSD, infrequent color flashes, melty walls.  I also noticed that I was clenching my jaws a lot, just like on LSD.  When I used to trip with my friends as a teenager, everyone would talk about how the strychnine in acid made them clench their jaws\x85 what a load of shit.  I had confirmed that this was merely a myth, as my body felt the same as it does on acid.  As I paced about the basement, I had a desire to find a pen and draw, however, I knew that there were no pens in the basement.  So I let my body lead me to a place to sit down, I wandered over to a cooler and popped a squat.  I looked down and lo and behold there was a pencil on the floor beside it.  It would seem that the HBW seeds turn on the physio-subconscious guidance system.  I also found a yard stick and decided to take the two objects upstairs.      After going out to star gaze for awhile, I came in and sat down.  It was about 2:20 a.m.  I was now hot so I stripped off my winter coat and sweater and got a cold wet rag.  Still enjoying tactile sensations, I found myself rubbing my face and arms repeatedly with the rag.  I then found myself having sexual fantasies about girls I knew and then promptly refuting the fantasies, saying no I have a girlfriend.  I must have carried on with this juvenile struggle for an hour before I decided to lie down on the floor again with the comforter.  I thought to myself this must be the contemplative part of the trip and I am juxtaposing my inner conflict.      As I was lying there, I was becoming aware of pain again, as I felt a slight headache coming on.  Still very clenchy, twitchy, and energetic, I drank a beer to try to relax.  Lying on the floor I closed my eyes.  There I experienced very intense vivid daydream-type dreams.  They were science fiction themed with a menacing alien element to them.  Audibly I would hear a crackly, buzzing sound, like electric guitar feedback, then the dreams would come on.  I kept pulling myself out of the dreams as I felt like I was being suck into them and may never be able to get out.  I immediately accused the plant spirit of trying to kill me only to later realize that it was merely fashioning dreams out of my conscious struggles from earlier.  This fact really came home when I had a dream in which two rival scientists battled it out in their laboratory.      A few minutes later my girlfriend came out and laid down with me.  After about twenty minutes and me shaking a real spider off of my leg, she coaxed me back to bed where I passed out without any incidents.  It was about 5:30 a.m. at this point.      The next morning I apologized to the plant spirit for falsely accusing it of trying to destroy me, and made a list of the following things:    - I should not do high doses of psychedelic drugs if I am fearful of having a heart attack.  I can- and should- only do high doses if my heart is healthy via exercise, healthy diet, and faith.  - The Woodrose makes dreams of my thoughts, so it may prove to be valuable in overcoming psychological blocks.  - I should not use Woodrose when I am feeling drowsy or fearful.  - A sensual nature is accentuated by HBW, but only becomes sexual in the later stages.  - It opened up physio-subconscious channels that operated like a guidance system to my conscious mind.  - And last but not least, I experienced absolutely no nausea.      In retrospect, I will have to experiment more with this drug at earlier hours so that I am not fatigued and fighting with the drug.  I will also have to take it in a setting where I do not feel the need to create an inner conflict that will be augmented by the drug.  LSA is indeed very much like LSD, I would like to take the more traditional Mexican Morning Glory to compare with this one.  LSA is like a subtle and natural LSD trip."
61004,Pulled Out of Suicidal Depression,TryptamineDreamer,"Sep 28, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"The trip I am writing about was my first trip with any psychedelic. It took place more than five years ago. I am writing about it because it changed my life more than anything I have ever done. Before the trip, I had been severely depressed for four years. I attempted suicide twice and had other suicide plans that I was unable to carry out. I wanted to die, and the primary reason for the trip was a hope that it would either reduce the depression or that it would be so bad that it would help me end my life. It was a long time ago, so the times are just rough estimates. I do not remember all of the details.    T+0:00 I thoroughly chew 12 seeds and swallow. The taste is horrible, and stays around for a while.    T+2:00 It has been a couple of hours, and I am not feeling much. My vision is altered in a way that is hard to define.    T+3:00 Definitely feeling altered and the nausea has gotten worse. Everything looks different. I feel terrible, mentally and physically. I would not call these effects psychedelic, just fucked up in a bad way.    T+4:00 Around this time the nausea hits a peak and I vomit. After that, I start to dry heave. This continues for maybe 15 minutes.    T+4:30 I feel so bad. I want to die. My body feels poisoned and my mood is one of despair. I want this to end now. I am going to try to sleep.    T+5:00 I can\'t sleep. The lights are out and I can see the visuals now. They consist of multicolor blobs, similar to a lava lamp. This is the only trip where I saw this type of visual. The nausea has subsided, but the despair has intensified. I now feel as if I am going insane. I feel intense regret over how terribly I have been treating my parents and anyone else I have the chance to mistreat. I have said the most horrible things to my parents daily for the last two years. It is not because I hate them, I have just been so miserable. I wished my mother would have had an abortion, and I have told her that. The tears of sorrow keep flowing.    T+5:30 I feel worse than I ever have before. I want to kill myself. Time is moving so slowly. The last 30 minutes seem more like 30 hours. I look at my watch expecting to see that an hour has passed but find that it has been only a minute or two. Time has never moved so slowly, before or since. I feel nothing but disgust with myself. I deserve to suffer. I am a horrible person.    T+6:00 Time is still crawling by at an unimaginably slow pace. I feel that I am permanently insane. I fear that I will be stuck in this hellish state for eternity. I feel a mix of mostly negative emotions. Regret, fear, self-hatred, hopelessness. Guilt for treating my parents like shit. I also feel love for the few people I am close to. I usually cant feel that. This is the closest thing to hell I have ever felt. If this lasts forever, I feel it will be what I deserve. The temperature feels uncomfortably cold. There is not a moment of comfort in this.    T+8:00 I can feel it starting to wear off. This is a great relief. It won\'t last forever after all. I still feel like shit. I still feel the sorrow and regret. I want more than anything to change. I want to be a nicer person. I want the depression to go away. I can\'t see anyway to change, and that is something I can\'t take.    T+9:00 Feeling a mixture of negative emotions and peacefulness. Even moments of euphoria.    T+10:00 The deepest peace and well-being has washed over me. I have never felt like this before. I am crying again, but this time it is tears of joy. I know I can change. I feel like things will get better. This is the first time I have felt hopeful in years. Tomorrow, I am going to apologize for the things I have said and done. I can\'t change the past, but I can make the future better. I will not continue to treat people so badly. I feel like this will last.    T+11:00 The peacefulness and well-being are not as strong now, but I still feel good and I feel that things have changed. I am tired, and soon I will sleep.    T+12:30 This is around the time I got to sleep, still feeling peace and comfort.    Next day: I feel very good. There are some feelings of regret over my behavior the last few years, but overall I feel good. The depression has lifted for the first time in years.    For over a week, the depression was completely erased. It did come back gradually after that, but never as bad as it was before the trip. I have also treated people much better since the trip. During the trip, I was able to empathize with others much better than usual. It has been over five years, so it seems the improvement was permanent. This was probably the most important night of my life, and definitely the most important trip. I don\'t think I would be alive today if I had not found something to alleviate the depression. I still use psychedelics, and they will usually get rid of the depression for 2-4 weeks after use. I have tried a variety of antidepressants. None have worked. Psychedelics are the only things that have helped.    I have recently started using piracetam and choline. That seems to be helping. I notice a mood lift after dosing. At the time of writing, it has been over a month since a DPT trip, and the depression is still gone. I dont know if it is just from the DPT, or if the piracetam and choline are helping."
64402,A Cavern of Jewels,MDC,"Sep 20, 2009","H.B. Woodrose, Salvia divinorum (10x extract) & Cannabis","I used to trip on a very regular basis, but it had been over a year since I last tripped, and wanted to trip again. I decided to start cultivating my own mushrooms for personal consumption again, but while waiting on that ordered two new things I\'ve always wanted to try but never have. I purchased ~30g dried peruvian torch flesh and 10 seeds of hawaiian baby woodrose. I decided first to try the HBWR the other day, and have yet to consume the peruvian torch.    I meticulously peeled the seeds, and for further measure wet them and rubbed off anything else that I couldnt get with a knife point or fingernails alone. I let these dry overnight, and the next morning crushed them in a garlic press. I then soaked the seeds in rather small amount of distilled water for approximately 3 hours, and ran a few errands. When I returned I put some water on the stove and prepared two mugs of ginger green tea, one for prior to ingestion and one to immediately follow ingestion. I had heard a number of complaints of serious stomach upset from the seeds, and hoped the ginger would help ease any discomfort. I strained any large chunks of seed out of the extract, leaving a slightly gritty but clear liquid with a color similar to a pale golden liquor. This I mixed with a good quantity of orange juice to help mask any potentially unpleasant flavor, which it did beautifully.    In about 20-30 minutes I began feeling lethargic and experienced a pronounced pain in the stomach, but no nausea. I decided to go lay down in bed for a while, to help calm my stomach and nerves. I lay with my eyes closed for almost the entire time, and drifted in and out of dreamlike visions and distinct but mild CEVs. I cannot, at this moment, remember all that I witnessed, and of course at 10 seeds it was not the most visually intricate or distinct of visual phenomena, but it was very present indeed. I do remember a vast field of nothing, with points of white/blue light that was shifting between being stars and being blocks, eminating from the center of a nonexistant cross. That is to say, there were four fields of these regularly spaced lights with space between each field. I remember more intricate and far less describable visual patterning, which rippled like the surface of a lake. Colors were hard to describe, and more often left simply the impression of a color, but I seem to have the impression of many oranges, reds, greens and blues.    A number of odd images briefly flashed in my minds eye but were elusive and hard to identify, let alone describe. I slipped often between the closed eye patterns and a dreamy state, the effects were very psychedelic at this point but I still also felt quite tired, and haven\'t any idea whether I really kept falling asleep and actually dreaming for brief periods, or if I was simply having particularly strong visions. It wasn\'t like normal dreams I have, but neither was it anything at all like the normal visuals I\'ve experienced with psychedelics.    The previous visions and experiences made up about the first two hours of the experience, which really surprised and excited me. Upon rising from this trancelike state, I felt no nausea but a continued pain in the gut, which didn\'t leave until the effects diminished entirely. While I didn\'t feel sick, I knew I must purge and went to the bathroom to do so, and felt quite better afterwards. I was feeling exhilerated, and the effect was still strong and reminded me very much of the feeling of mushrooms or acid, but I was to find the 2 hour come up was to include the most intense effects I would receive from the seeds alone.    I knew I had a long way to go, and was unsure if the effects would keep increasing, or taper away very, very slowly. I was unaware I\'d experienced a peak very early on, and decided to wait and find out. So I went to my living room and smoked a bong and drank some water while watching Labyrinth. After the movie, I realized the marijuana made the experience more pleasant, but I had reached the highest level of intensity there would be and passed it for good.    It had been quite a while since tripping, but I had some 10x salvia divinorum extract left from a long while ago. My original experiences with salvia were very positive and spiritual, but later on I began having only quite frightening trips which were hard to handle, and this caused me to go a long, long time without using it. I suspected that being in an already fairly psychedelic state, it may be easier for me to make the transition into the other reality of salvia, and decided to test this hypothesis. I settled into bed and prepared a very small test hit, just to give me a reminder of what a heavier experience would be like, to help me decide whether I really wanted to proceed.    Upon smoking this tiny hit I closed my eyes and noticed a definite but mild shift in consciousness to begin with, followed by very fluid and flowing visual patterning. I got some very real effects and handled the experience beautifully, and really enjoyed the lovely imagery and unusual mindset of the salvia experience, mild though it was. As I returned to mostly normal reality, I decided I did in fact wish to proceed into a much more profound excursion, but still did not wish to overdo things. I put in a hit about twice as big as the previous one, but still a small hit.    Upon smoking this and again closing my eyes, the visual patterning returned quite strongly and became a whirling tornado of patterns and color. I began to lose any and all knowledge of my body and my life outside of this other dimension. My existance was purely spiritual and mental, a point of awareness and being with no name or face, but which surely could see. The patterning wrapped itself around me, circling, and then split into an upper and lower portion, each spinning another way. The patterns quickly gave way to the more otherworldly space, as I broke through and came into a physically different place. I had the sense of rising, but rising through the earth, into a cavern deep within the earth.    This cavern was full of colors and intricate designs, and was inhabited by some sort of object containing an entity or entities, a multifaceted object with a machinelike exoskeleton, but with facets like shining jewels. Each facet seemed to be a face or eye, but it was unclear if every one was different or all the same entity. It spoke to me as one, welcoming me and calling me by name, reminding me who I was. Oddly, I was the one communicating telepathically, repeatedly stating that I\'d returned. I take this to be a statement of humility and accomplishment simultaneously, as well as one of reverence. I feel as though the past few heavy trips had taken me to a hellish realm which was a form of punishment for misusing this substance, whereas initially I received wonderful visions of deities, witnessed spontaneous healing of a loved one, was privvy to what goes on \'behind the scenes.\' My statement and feeling of having returned was quite significant, implying not only that I\'d returned, but that I\'d learned from mistakes and wish to approach carefully and humbly now, and wish to learn what can be taught.    As is usually the case with significant salvia trips, right as I was becoming reoriented in my new environment I was pushed back down into normal reality, back into my head. My eyes snapped open. I could see my room, but could not figure out yet where or who I was, and it took several minutes of lying there to reorient myself with ordinary reality. At first, I even felt as though I may have gone back to the wrong place, into someone else\'s head, in fact I felt like my head was in the right place, but I felt my body as being directly beneath my head standing upright, not in front of my head laying down as I could see this person doing. I felt my hand on my chest, but didn\'t know for sure if I was alone or not. Was it my hand? My chest? Could I be sure they were both mine? I could still sense the presence of the entity to the left of me, but could see nothing out of the ordinary.    As I finally came to grips with everything I looked at a clock - the two salvia trips had taken about 25-30 minutes. I kept waiting to come down completely from the salvia until I remembered that I had taken the hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, and would not return to baseline for probably another four hours at least. I spent a while just sitting outdoors on my balcony reflecting on my salvia trips, and drinking water. I soon made some food for myself, as it was the middle of the afternoon and I\'d yet to eat. After a while of just being still and quiet, I went back indoors and just decided to watch some TV for a while and smoke some more bonghits. The very last effects were diminishing around 9 and a half hours, and I enjoyed a small drink of gin and a homebrew now that my stomach was feeling better. Sleep came easily later that night, and I felt well rested the next day.    All in all I\'m quite surprised with the experience. I\'m particularly surprised at the intensity of the trip during the come up, and the trancelike state I experienced initially. As mild as the rest of the trip was (sans Salvia) I was shocked at the effects I received initially. I was quite pleased with the effects of the HBWR, and noted remarkable mental clarity throughout the experience. I will definitely try these seeds again, both by themselves in a higher dose and in the same dose in addition to some cubensis mushrooms."
58914,Love Energy,Jesusface,"Sep 16, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"First off I\'d like to say I\'ve eaten woodrose seeds many many times, and the trips have ranged from awful to great. This is my most recent experience with them and by far it was one of the greatest experiences of my life.    So on this particular night I came home from work around 6:00 pm and decided to eat the seeds. I ate seven seeds that I had prepared by taking sand paper and removing the outer layer off them. Im not sure if this actually does anything but I tend to think it reduces nausea. Ive eaten the seeds many times without removing the outer layer and was fine. I ate the seeds, I chewed them up and swallowed them with some ginger ale. Within fifteen minutes I started to feel them coming on, which startled me because it usually takes an hour or so. The initial feeling was one of small shocks zipping through my jaw and everything started to move a little faster.    About fifteen minutes after I started feeling the trip coming on, a girl I have been seeing lately called me and asked me to come to a party. I told her no cause I was tripping and didnt want to be around a bunch of drunk people. I then hung up and she called me immidiately back asking why I hung up on her. For some reason I thought the conversation had ended and was thoughougly confused for her being angry with me. I apologized and then said goodbye.    I went back to my room, and put in a Michael Franti and Spearhead cd, and decided to finish drawing a picture of a tree I had started earlier. By this time the trip was very strong and everything was glowing and slightly moving, and I had a wonderful feeling of euphoria. The music was mostly upbeat songs about love and I was really digging it, dancing around, smiling, singing along, and coloring my picture like a madman.     After a while, I have no idea of time at this point because I couldnt find my cellphone which is my only clock. But after a while I went outside to piss and everything was wonderful, I live in woods and it was dark out but everything had bright pschyadelic colors to it contrasting with the darkness of night. While I was peeing I noticed my arms looked like something out of a alex grey painting, I could see my nerve endings and muscles and all this beautiful colored energy radiating out of them. I also had this great feeling of love, which I could feel growing in me and radiating out into the night. I had a profound understanding that I was connected to everyone and evertone\'s love and engergy at that moment and just felt so fucking happy.    I decided I would shoot my new found love engery out across the sky to my ex girlfriend who was 7 states north of me at the time. I closed my eyes and saw it fly though the air and find her, I saw her only as her energy form, mostly bright engergy patterns in the form of a nervous system. I could see my love, which at that time was now every thing in the universe\'s love, surrounding her and charging her up. It was beautiful and amazing. I felt like I understood everything I needed to know. I then sent the love energy to many other people I know, and all the while could see and feel it growing bigger and bigger.    Finally I went back to my room and listened to the same two Spearhead cd\'s over and over, and danced and sang along feeling better than I ever have in my life. I knew that I had stumbled onto a profound truth about life and all I had to do was tap into this love and everything would be ok. Eventually I decided I would call it a night and turned off my light and laid down and tried to sleep. I had amazing visuals and Im not sure if I slept or not. I eventually woke up, that is if I ever slept, Im not sure and went to the kitchen house and did my dishes, from the week before, and I was still tripping and I still had my wonderful feeling of enlightenment and love. I went to work and all day called my friends telling them about my experience and how I had figured out the key to happiness, which is tapping into this universal godlove engry as I have been calling it.    And the most amazing thing is, I have been able to get this feeling since then and feel it rushing through my body if I concentrate on it, and I become all blissful and happy. Without the drugs. Its only been a week since the trip but I am still happy and buddah like, and can tap into this love by simply thinking about it, and I really do feel the body buzz of that night when I do this. Its kind of like something clicked in my brain, that I always thought was possible and now it IS possible and happening."
75117,I Spoke Too Fast,Squabbles,"Jul 31, 2009",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue,"The purpose of this experience was to try an extract of Syrian Rue followed by Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, sublingually. I have tried HBW alone a month ago, but I felt some of the problems I had encountered could be avoided this time. Nothing worked out as planned, but thankfully it wasn\'t an all-out disaster.    Prior to the experience:  I am seventeen, and have too much time on my hands. Since you are reading this, the obvious conclusion to this introduction is that I use drugs. And that conclusion is right. I have dabbled in alcohol (too much, too young; I\'ve found better since), marijuana (anywhere from monthly to weekly), DXM (these days, monthly; my reference trips in terms of intensity), nutmeg (to spice up a boring weekend, once in many months), as well as the odd kratom, kanna, diphenhydramide/dimenhydrinate, yarrow, wormwood, the unsuccessful salvia and ayahuasca... Anything really, as one could guess, but mostly easily available (legal) stuff.     Two days before this experience, I ground up ten grams of syrian rue with the intention of making an extract, with acetic acid, non-iodized salt, distilled water and the whole thing... which I ended up not using at all because it didn\'t work. A tea would have been much simpler. I also ground 13 seeds of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose after sanding most of the darker skin, scraping my fingertips bare in the process.     The day before to the experience, I fasted all day, then ate a little dinner, obviously following the MAOI restrictions.     Ah, finally, the day of the experience. The following will be written in real-time as much as the experience allows me.    -6:30 I wake up and eat a little rice to facilitate throwing up if need be. Good mood.    -7:00 I shove a teaspoon of syrian rue seeds in my mouth and chew them. I expected what it would taste like because I chewed up a few seeds the day before to make my mouth glow under a black light, but I could not be prepared for the intensity of the taste. I only managed to chew half the seeds in my mouth before I swallowed, because I would have thrown up if I kept them there any longer. I then washed my mouth with lots of toothpaste, and chewed peppermint gum.    -7:45 Not feeling anything peculiar yet, I chew up a little more seeds, and chew more gum. I feel no nausea once the taste is gone from my mouth.    -8:15 I decided my MAO must have been as low as it gets, despite not knowing what to expect from MAO inhibition. I put the ground HBW seeds in a little water, let it sit in the glass for a minute, added orange juice, and into my mouth it went. I swallowed some as I was swirling it around my mouth, but I didn\'t fear nausea too much because I scraped the seeds...     -8:45 I chose to swallow the whole seed mush and juice, alea jacta est, I\'ll deal with the nausea. The sublingual absorbtion prior to swallowing will at least guarantee me that I get some effects even if I throw up.    -9:45 I spoke too fast. It took me 15 minutes to gather the strength to type this. At maybe 9:00, I started to feel the nausea (which is more of an extreme body load than pure nausea, much like food poisoning). I laid down in my bed, where I started to feel some effects: strobing in the peripheral vision, powerful imagination (almost like dreaming), sedation. At about 9:30, I went to puke and take a shower, and the effects are somewhat weaker since... They\'ll probably come back, I\'ve read that MAOIs tend to make the experience come in waves. Now listening to Blockhead and lying in bed.    -10:30 The experience seems to have taken an empathogenic turn. The slight visual effects I first had have disappeared completely, but lying in my bed, I almost dissolved in bliss while listening to music... Plus, I simply can\'t stand up without the nausea returning.    -13:10 I spoke too fast, again. Whoooaaah... I finally snapped out of it, and the world is a beautiful place. I laid in bed, writhing in pain for all this time, and all of sudden, it felt as if a blanket of lead was lifted off me. First, the effects are FAR from gone; I might still be coming up. My thoughts are rushing forward and on themselves like a mighty river, yet very still like a dark forest; yes, I do feel very clich-hippy. Everything seems like a dream but crystal-clear, even though objects are slightly moving, morphing, bleeding... I can\'t put it into words, but if LSD feels like this but MORE intense... Whoooaaah...     -14:30 Ah, spoke too fast once more... I spent the last hour fighting nausea and doing chores. Why rake the leaves, when all this rich, moist food could return to the Earth? Oh, we have a beautiful lawn now, all clean and everything, the Man will like it. I had to find a pretext every ten minutes to go inside and throw up, all the while avoiding any eye contact since my pupils are so huge they could be the next place where Mankind sets foot. I finally proposed to do other chores so I could go inside, so I cleaned the toilets, puked, cleaned the toilets some more... I now have a bit of time to myself, I wish I could just lay down until I feel better, but I can\'t pretext to be sick once more. That would be the third time in a month.     -15:00 Well, the only conclusion I can think of for this experience is that I won\'t try it anytime soon. I\'d need a weekend alone to avoid busting what little cover I have left, with all the fasting and puking and lying in bed for hours. It would have been lots of insightful fun, a real death and rebirth experience,  if only I had the day to myself to enjoy and reflect upon the almost near-death experiences I\'ve had. I\'m still tripping, but I don\'t think anything eventful is going to happen soon, so I\'ll sum this up by saying: I spoke too fast. Thanks for reading.     ----------------------------------------    Yes, I spoke too fast, one last time; it was an all-out disaster. Ironically enough, when I finished writing the above yesterday (unchanged since) and turned my computer off, I was far from done with LSA... Or rather, the LSA was far from done with me. I drifted pleasantly in my bed, between sleep and consciousness, until maybe 17:30, where I gathered my thoughts to acknowledge someone screaming downstairs.  My father was once more mad at everything for no apparent reason, yelling and punching objects around. It\'s not the first time he\'s done this, and it always gets to me; I always feel like I want to disappear until he\'s done, but this time, with the LSA still having its hold on my emotions, I was overcome by sadness and grief. This feeling swelled instantly to incredible proportions, and I was now sad for everything wrong in the universe, and tears came rushing down my cheeks. I was sobbing so hard I had trouble breathing. I put my clothes on, went downstairs, put my boots and my coat on. My sister asked, what\'s wrong?, to which I could only reply I\'m going for a walk. You can come. Sure enough, she put on her coat and shoes, and ran after me since I was already heading towards the park. Nobody saw us go away.     I burst into tears once more, and explained the whole situation to her, how I felt everything was wrong beyond any hope in the universe, but especially how our family had an enormous communication problem, and that\'s when she burst in tears too. I felt like a ridiculous sobbing giant (I\'m six feet tall, which isn\'t that big, but with my much smaller sister holding me in her arms I felt huge at the time) and asked her that we go to a particular place in the park, with benches and a good view of the river. By that time, my grief was of nihilistic proportions. I only felt this bottomless pit inside me, and felt like I was sinking in it. To me, there was no meaning to anything watsoever, and I knew everyone felt the same but that nobody ever talked about it, and that was why there was so much pain and sadness in the world. I felt I would have set myself on fire if it could have eased the grief in the world.     My sister told me she felt the same (but in a more pragmatic, non LSA-induced metaphysical existential crisis way), and we took the very weird resolution that if nothing meant anything, then we could take the huge risk of confronting the whole family. Our determination was very high for a minute or two, but as we came closer to home, I felt like I wouldn\'t be able to do it. We finally arrived, and my father asked my sister where were you? She started explaining in a calm voice, when my father noticed my contorted, red, wet face.     The following would be quite hard to explain, both because I can\'t make sense out of it and because I still feel extremely bad. I tried to explain how I felt, but I couldn\'t reach in my mother the feeling of powerlessness towards the lack of any meaning every human has to face; it frustrated me even more, because I was persuaded at the time (and I still am!) that everyone is unable to deal with nihilistic thoughts but just put them aside, but all my mother could reply was explain me! I can\'t understand what you\'re talking about! I don\'t feel that way!. That did nothing to help my sorrow, of course. The only thing I can conclude from the weirdest discussion I\'ve ever had with my parents is that they want me to tell them the next time I feel like nihilistic shit instead of escaping with drugs (which wasn\'t the intent in the first place) and the promise that they would try and manage their stress better. Ah, the joys of intergenerational communication.     It is now the next day, 5 pm. I feel worn out, both emotionally, mentally and physically; I only slept two hours and have had muscular cramps all night. I never thought LSA could precipitate emotions so strongly, but now I know I\'ll have to wait until I\'m more stable before I try anything like that again."
55374,A Nightmare,Brian,"Jun 16, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"So I had read about the possible effects of taking Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, and I wanted to give it a try.  I ordered a pack of the seeds from an internet supplier.  The seeds were supposedly untreated, to help minimize poisonous nausea.  30 minutes before I ingested the seeds, I took 1 dramamine tablet in hopes that this would help any possible nausea.  After that I crushed up 5 baby woodrose seeds and decided what better way to swallow them then with a little ice cream.  My ingestion took place at around 9:30-10:00. I had eaten some dinner a couple hours before (mistake) so I was taking these seeds on a full stomach.    A little after 10 I started to get drowsy. I turned on the TV and layed on the couch.  I began to drift off to sleep and my head began to buzz moderately.   At around 10:30 I fell asleep.   At 11 I got off the couch I went to my room.  I was still very drowsy.  Within the seconds before I fell asleep in my own bed I recalled taking the seeds, and came to the conclusion that the earlier head buzzing would be the extent of my trip.  I couldnt have been more wrong.    At approximately 12:00 I awoke.  I felt like complete shit.  My head was spinning, buzzing, and tingling.  My hole body felt very tingly, almost a feeling of numbness.  My arms and legs felt especially screwed up.  I was experiencing hot flashes, and I felt like my body was out of control.  Thinking was very hard.  My mind was very cloudy.  It was almost too much effort to try and analyze what the hell was happening to me.  The hole feeling was extremely unpleasant.  I tried to lie down in a comfortable position, but every time I moved it was as if I was shaking the snow globe, and my head would spin out of control.  All while this was happening, my stomach was in extreme pain.  I figured that it was my body trying to digest the seeds.  The sensation that had taken over my arms and legs was very uncomfortable.  Every time my legs would rub against any part of my body, the numb feeling would become to intense and I would return to my former position.    After what seemed like forever, I mustered up the strength to turn onto my other side and read the time on the clock.  It was only 12:02.  At this point I started to freak out.  I felt like I couldnt go on.  The feeling was too unbearable.  I just shut my eyes layed there. My stomach continued to squish and squirm. I felt like I was going to throw up.  So I tried to subdue the feeling.  Everything was getting worse and worse.  And of course the ever famous clich, I was pretty sure I was going to die.  I just couldnt take the pain and discomfort.  So basically I continued to experience all of the above mentioned feelings, which were not subsiding in the least bit.    The reasonable part of my brain tried to focus and, I was able to get a slight handle on the situation.  I told myself that it was ok.  I wasnt dying.  Alot of people have had bad experiences and they didnt die.  I will come down.  I remembered reading somewhere \'No matter how high or messed up you are, you WILL come down eventually.\'  So I just kept telling myself this, and kept my eyes closed praying that time would go by quick and I would start to feel better.  My symptoms showed no signs of letting up.  I also remembered reading that the baby woodrose experience should last 8 hours tops.  I kept telling myself, worst case scenario: you just have to make it until 6:00 and everything will be ok.  But time just moved in slow motion, as my body was dragged through this hell.  I wanted so badly to just fall asleep and wake up and be better, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldnt get to sleep.      Around 1:30 or 2:00 my stomach had had enough and I stumbled my way into the bathroom.  I kneeled over the toilet, but I couldnt throw up.  My stomach wanted me to throw up but I couldnt.  So I just sat in the bathroom.  I propped my back against the wall.  My head was still spinning, and it was near impossible to think.  At this point I hated myself for taking those damn seeds.  I realized what an idiot I was taking them on a full stomach, because I knew it would make the experience last even longer.  After 20 minutes I tried forcing myself to vomit.  But all I did was heave nothing into the toilet.  I was worried that I had waited too long, and now it was too late to throw anything up.  I still felt like complete zonked out crap.  30 minutes later I finally managed to throw up a little dinner.  I felt a little relief.  This was comforting.  I went back to bed still feeling pretty lousy.    I actually managed to fall asleep for about an hour.  I awoke again at 3:00, my head still a mess, and my stomach even more so.  I went to the bathroom again and tried to make myself throw up again.  This time it did not work.  I was upset, because I though this was the only way I was going to feel better, and now my stomach contents had already started digesting, and that it was too late.  I was convinced I was never going to feel better.  My body and mind still felt very numb and very uncomfortable.  I was on the verge I calling an ambulance, I was so messed up.    I eventually passed out in my bathroom, slept for an hour, went back to my room, still feeling lousy.  Now it was about 4 o clock (6 hours after ingestion time) and the sickness felt like it hadnt slowed down at all.  I stared at the clock until 5, and was convinced I was never going to feel better yaddad yadda yadda.  Finally fell asleep, and woke up around 7 ish.  Felt like I had come down alot, but still messed up.  layed in bed, tried to go to the bathroom, fell asleep again.  Woke up.  My nauseau felt manageable. But after 11 hours my body still had the slight numb feeling.  I tried to talk, and I could barely put a sentence together.      I layed down and watched tv for the rest of the day.  Eating anything was out of the question.  Around noon, I was feeling like complete crap, but I had finally come all the way down.  I thankfully slept the hole night that night, and felt way way way better the next morning.  I was very relieved.  The previous night had to have been the worse night of my life.  A complete nightmare.    In conlusion, I am never ever eating these seeds again.  This helped me set a rule of thumb for myself as far drugs in general are concerned, which is: to not eat or drink any concoction, because it will stay in your body for a long time create hell in your stomach for even days to follow."
60206,Memoirs of HBWR: 1979-1999,Curious Travels,"Apr 17, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"I first learned of LSA many years ago after reading articles about morning glory seeds (Ipomea species). Unfortunately, these were difficult to obtain except as chemically treated seeds and I was not interested in being poisoned for my own protection by paternalistic corporations.    In the late 1970s I bought a little book called Legal Highs at a headshop and discovered Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose contained LSA. I was interested but also apprehensive about trying these. After all, LSA is a precursor to LSD and it was used ceremonially in the form ololiuqui by Native Mexicans and others from that part of the world to induce powerful visionary experiences. What if I took these seeds into my body and had a terrifying vision? Would I have to go to the hospital? Would the police be involved and then what?    I decided to try the HBWR seeds anyway and purchased a little baggie with 24 seeds from the same headshop. I read the instructions and proceeded to clean the fuzzy coating off nine of the seeds using a single edge razor blade. That was tedious work but worth it to minimize potential toxicity (and I was worried about eating the poison treated morning glory seeds!). Next, I crushed 9-12 seeds with a hammer, mixed them in water and drank the whole mess. The taste was horrible like a mix of raw green peppers and coffee. The taste was so bad I wanted to vomit but held it down anyway.    Within an hour I began to notice the first effects. These were changes in my vision and a warm pleasant feeling. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that my pupils were extremely dilated and the whites looked yellow but then everything had a yellowish cast. I was grinning from ear to ear. I do not remember very much of this first trip (way back in 1979) except that it was pleasant with time, space, and size distortions. There was no panic, no fear, no horrible visions, and no physical sickness. I smoked a little reefer during the night and some cigarettes. The trip lasted some eight hours. The next morning I was sleepy, probably a combination of the HBWR alkaloids and staying up until 3 in the morning.  \t  I began eating HBWR seeds fairly often over the next 20 years and never felt sick or had a bad experience. After my first experience, instead of drinking them in a glass of water I ground them to a powder in a pepper grinder and put that into gelatin capsules. \t\t\t  \t  I believe setting is important when taking psychedelics like HBWR. I always made sure that there was nothing urgent to do, that I had fasted for at least six hours (no cheeses or other aged/fermented foods or other MAO inhibitors), kept the lights low, listened to ambient types of music, had a cup of tea nearby, some high quality sticky marijuana and a few cigarettes (Camel straights). Good company was also helpful even if they were not taking HBWR."
55180,The Selfish Trip That Made Me Selfless,Tim,"Feb 20, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"My friend Zach and I consumed the seeds in the desert at about 7:15pm.  I counted out 9 seeds, put them in a plastic baggie, and smashed them with a rock.  I poured my seed crumbs into a half full water bottle, shook it up, and drank it.  It tasted like potting soil.  Zach did the same with 8 seeds.  We walked over to a cement drainage area in the desert and waited for the drugs to kick in while the sun went down.  After about an hour, some visual distortions became noticable, like the spray-painted pentagram on the wall that started bleeding.  We decided to drive to QT while we still had the ability.  [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]  We each bought a Fuze to drink and nothing else.  We then drove back to a local park and sat at the picnic tables.  Around 9 o clock my other friend Jason rode his bike to the park and met up with us.  He was supposed to have taken his 8 seeds at the same time we did, but he had to go to his grandma\'s birthday party at the last minute.  He took his seeds then and there, and we all layed down on the concrete and looked up at the stars.  I began to feel very sick and dizzy and my legs hurt as if I\'d just sprinted 100 miles.  We all just kinda layed around the park for a while on the benches, slides, and picnic tables.  Eventually, Zach and Jason sat down near the slides, and I sat by myself at the other side of the playground.  The sick feeling continued to worsen, and I felt like I was in a fog of pain and confusion.  My first trip with 6 microwaved seeds resulted in no discomfort or unpleasantness whatsoever.  I wanted so badly for this trip to be over, the sick feeling overshadowed any positive feeling that came from the high.  I sat there and thought long and hard about drugs and why I did them.  Finally, I\'d estimate at around 11pm, I vomited everything I had in my stomach onto the ground and my shoe.  I rinsed out my mouth in the drinking fountain and sat down with Zach and Jason.  I told them that I felt almost completely better, and that this drug wasn\'t so bad after all.  I took Jason\'s bike for a ride and felt amazing.  The sound of the rear wheel clicking as I coasted down the sidewalk brought back many good memories of riding a bike as a young kid.  I came back to the picnic table and Zach told me he had been feeling sick too, but was trying to ignore the feeling.  After a few more minutes of chatting about nothing at the picnic tables, Zach vomited too.  I told him about Albert Hofmann\'s book that I was reading.  In it, there are a series of LSD trips that follow a recurring theme.  The people tripping feel as if they are going through hell.  They then experience a climax of pain/terror/horror, and then feel purged and clean and enligtened for the remaining part of the trip.    Jason took his bike for a ride around the park again, and Zach and I talked more about drugs.  He told me that this trip made him never want to do any drugs again.  I had been having similar thoughts and we talked about it while Jason rode around on his bike.  We decided that smoking pot was a selfish thing people do to entertain themselves when they are bored.  We realized on this particular night, the main reason we did LSA was the opportunity to see cool colors or weird hallucinations, but at the price of risking our health, and passing up the opportunity to do more productive things with the people who truly care about us.    Jason came back from his bike ride, and I convinced myself I was sober enough to drive to 7-11 to get food.  Jason got a popsicle, and I got some tums to settle the remaining pains in my stomach.  After what seemed like a long time of aimlessly driving around with nowhere to go, We dropped Jason off at his house at midnight.  Zach and I went to the elementary school and gathered our thoughts and tried to come down from the trip.  I began to think more and more about all the people in my life and I looked at how I affected them from their point of view.  I felt very guilty and selfish for letting myself drift away from my family, who truly cared about me.  In the past several months I had started smoking pot again and was always quiet at the dinner table and never felt like talking to anyone.  There had been many other times when I blew off my wonderful girlfriend, who hates when I smoke pot, and chose to hang out with my stoner friends instead.  I went home that night and felt terrible about the person I was.  I woke up the next morning, with the drugs completely out of my head, and took the bus to see my girlfriend.  I spent the entire day with her fixing up her new apartment and watching movies.  I felt closer to my girlfriend than I had in months, and it made her incredibly happy.  The positive feeling at the end of that day was far greater than the mindless complacency of coming home high and eating cookies in front of the computer.  This drug made me think deeper and harder than I ever had before.  Because of it, I changed my outlook on life."
74230,Depression and Headaches,Daytripper,"Feb 4, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"I noticed a pleasant after-effect from these seeds. I am a 22 year old female, and I have suffered from depression and severe headaches most of my life. I have taken SSRIs on and off for about five years, and sometimes codeine or dihydrocodeine for the pain.    I have tried LSA before in the form of morning glory seeds, but I did not notice much of an effect. I became interested in HBW when I heard it was more potent. Anyway, I only took five seeds, since this was my first time. I\'m not really experienced with psychedelics at all. This small dose did not make me sick in my stomach, but then I have quite a strong stomach. After having some terrible alcohol hangovers, and after having taken nutmeg, the slight queasiness from HBW seemed like nothing to me. I realise that other people react differently, and some people feel very sick when taking this stuff.    My \'trip\' was mild, but interesting - enhanced colours and sounds, a slightly \'stoned\' feeling, patterns on buildings and textiles jumped around a bit, I noticed I was talking about some very silly things with my friend and laughing a lot more than usual. It was nothing mind blowing, but it was pleasant.     I did not notice the real benefits of this drug until the next day, and the days following. I felt much more cheerful and open than usual, and much less stressed, even though work was the same with its pressures. I remember my food tasting particularly good. I also was not bothered with the same aches and pains as usual. I will consider using low doses this substance instead of SSRIs and opiates in the future. I realise it might not be worth it for everyone, because of the fact that this substances makes some people vomit. However, I think more research needs to be done into using low doses of psychedelics for common ailments like this."
54638,A Malfunctioning Brain in a Bathtub,Andrew,"Jan 9, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"A few weeks ago, my room-mate showed me some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds he had purchased over the internet. I knew little about them besides the fact that they were similar to LSD with fewer visuals, which I thought meant less powerful. We soaked them overnight, then peeled of the coating, ate them, and drank the liquid.    Me and my friend took the LSA at around 9 - 9:30. I start to feel a bit sick almost immediately. We had just eaten a hearty supper earlier, something we had been advised against. I could have booted then, but was curious as to what I had in store. I decided to check online again, and noticed that some people had very bad experiences. I started to get worried, and a bit sick, and a half hour in decided to abort. I ran to the toilet and threw up.    A thing to note about this stuff is that it kept coming in waves. Good waves and bad waves. Me and the OP were usually not quite in sync throughout the night. I seemed to have gone through the trip faster than him, hitting the various \'stages\' before he did. And boy, were the stages different.    At this point I was feeling pretty wierd. I felt like I was full of some sort of energy force that was weighing me down. We listened to his \'Loveline\' archives. We were laughing loud. Eventually we decided we were ready for a bowl. Not too much had happened so far, but I felt very drunk. We smoked, and I left the room to play \'Shadow of the Colossus\'. I was at a point just before the final boss. I picked up the controller and the most amazing thing happened. I entered the videogame.    I bullsh*t thee not. Me and Wander became one and the same. His world felt like the world around me. Like I was in a dream. Like I was there. And when I saw that final collossus, A hundred story fire-eyed black stone devil, I was floored. I can\'t believe I was able to play as well as I was, but I wasn\'t doing too well. \'There are awesome things in this world\' I thought to myself as I dodged fireballs, but soon realized there was no way I could beat him in the state I was in. I got up from the game and left my room.    Things were now very, very amiss. I was now travelling through time, through my own memories. Like rapidly changing channels I relived random parts of my past, as though I was there. I was walking and dreaming at the same time. The walls cycled textures, reality was on the fritz. I stumbled into the hallway, thinking \'I\'m having a dream.\' I saw myself stumble over. At this point, I knew I was insane. A lunatic. My thoughts flew at random. I felt good- great. Amazing. In fact, I was experiencing what heaven must be like. And therefore, I knew heaven existed, because I was there. And of course, like Dante, I realized there was also a hell to explore. Would I be heading there as well that night?    It wouldn\'t be long. I had to get out of the hallway before I got in trouble. I thought: \'There\'s no place like home\' as I tried to force myself back into reality. I returned to my bed to lie down, and contemplated the rapidly exploding universe. Then a thought hit me: My friend was in the next room and he was probably tripping even harder than me! I quickly went to check on him and found him battling a thought loop. Him: \x85Were fighiting to keep our memories. But we arent going to remember this. Every thought is fighting to be remembered. But were stuck here forever! We have to record this\x85    I assured him I would remember everything, but he was in a loop and I wasnt getting in. Our minds were as schizophrenics now, flipping from topic to topic, flying from past to present like our brains were spinning. Our style of banter was not unlike the dialog in Fear and Loathing. He said something about levels. Everything was levels. I noted that Paul McCartney said the same thing the first time he tripped.    We were walking into walls. Lucidity came and went. I went to lie down in my bathtub. And this where my hellish, introspective nightmare began. I have no idea how long I lay in that tub. The neurons in my brain did things they never did before, and I wasnt liking it. I felt sick, drunk, and scared. What is existence? Am I just a malfunctioning brain in bathtub?    By 4 AM, I was finally ready to pass out. My friend had commandeered my bed due to the presence of an air conditioner, so we traded beds for a while, and I contemplated his giant wall mural. We eventually traded back and I fell asleep, while he continued to trip.    I was sober in the morning, but somehow he was still in deep brain-sh*t. He was having trouble breathing, and we decided he should get checked out at the hospital. Fortunately he recovered. But we learned our lesson:    LSA is a hell of a f**king drug. If you want to get your brain scrambled for ~$5 a hit, by all means, head on over to the internet and pick up some Woodrose seeds. But this isnt Acid Lite. It was the most powerful thing Ive ever tried and made 2C-E (which Ive tried before) feel like near-beer. And as the my friend could tell you, it can screw you sideways."
54552,My First Experience in Psychedelia,B (anonymous),"Jan 4, 2009",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Intrigued by the world of psychedelia, Ive always found myself curious of the places I could go, and things I could experience while still remaining in one place.  New to the world of psychedelics, I have often considered the power and possibility of the substances.  Before taking the H.B. Woodrose seeds, I had only experimented with marijuana as well as few opiates, never a psychedelic.  I\'m not sure whether HB Woodrose was the proper choice to enter this new world, but that is behind me now, I just want to record the experience I had.  On the journey was myself and my long time friend (D) who I have enjoyed many life experiences as well as a few related to drugs.    Time was something difficult for me to understand during this experience, but I will mark the times that I remember and what I was feeling at that moment to the best of my memory.    circa 10:30 pm: Myself and D, as well as a few other friends who did not take part in the HB Woodrose are seated around a fire in my backyard.  D and I each take one parachute of Woodrose seeds on a nearly empty stomach and down them with water.  The \'parachute\' included 11 seeds each, crushed and wrapped in tissue-like paper, resembling a popper that you throw at the ground and explodes.  After each taking a parachute of seeds, we enjoyed a joint of marijuana.  According to a friend, it \'speeds up\' the coming up.  Both of us are excited for the experience that awaits, but I began to wonder if D was fully aware of what can happen during a trip.  Looking back, I probably should have discussed it with him more, before we began.    11:15: Everyone at the fire is high, D and I have finished our joint, the other guys are still smoking.  One of my friends brought his laptop computer and watching itunes\' visualizer is one of my favorite things to do high.  It\'s difficult to say exactly when I began \'tripping\', but I would say close to midnight there was definitely a distinctive difference between this high, and any previous experience with pot.    12:30: As luck would have it, the sky began to rain.  I found it very difficult to understand what was happening at first, but my friends were seeming anxious and finally, I felt drops on my arm.  I think it was hard for D to really enjoy his trip while the others were there, he didn\'t seem completely comfortable, so it\'s probably better that they left.  We got the chairs on the deck and finished cleaning up, but did not make our way inside.  Instead, we ended up dancing around in the backyard for what seemed like hours.  Beyond \'dancing\', D found himself witnessing flashback memories from his past - stating that he was seeing everything he\'d ever done, in his memory.  He went from kneeling and bowing to spinning around and pacing in my backyard.    While this was happening, I was laying on my back watching the sky change colors.  The most distinct and vivid memory I have from this stage of the trip was the lightning.  As I lay on my back I remember watching a row of trees\' shadows contrast the sky and then flashes of lightning.  I was fixed on this thought and kept seeing it while we were outside, even as I looked in other directions.  I\'m quite sure that the marijuana was still in effect, because I found myself hungry and thirsty, and had the desire to make my way inside to get a snack and drink.    2:00: I am quite sure that by this time, we were inside, in my living room.  The television was on and I doubt either of us were at all high any longer.  D said that he was not feeling too well, and at this point, I was feeling great, so I hoped it would pass.  This stage of the night is where I have the greatest recollection, most likely because my mindset changed from enjoying the experience to helping my friend out of his.  It also could be asserted that because of my size compared to D\'s (280 to 150), the seeds may be wearing off sooner for me.  I think the seeds might have made his stomach upset, but as I said before, I don\'t think he was completely aware of the extent of a trip, and wasn\'t ready.    The television was on TV Land, \'All in the family\' reruns, I found the sitcom laughter annoying and I\'m pretty sure it wasn\'t making D\'s experience any better.  I turned off the television and made a few calls to some friends who had experience with psychedelics.  I was told to make him comfortable, not do anything out of the ordinary, and help to let him know that it would end.  D was sure he wouldn\'t survive, he kept telling me he didn\'t want to die, and nausea and vomiting reinforced these ideas.  Strangely, D didn\'t vomit any solid substance although he had a bit to eat, just some water and black residue, which I believe were the seeds.  I got the trusty iPod, put on Air, and told D that he\'d make it through this.  We both had a couch to lay on, and we tried to just relax and listen to the music, but found it difficult to find comfort - or fall asleep.    4:00: As I move from the couch to the floor, I remember neon lights and designs reminiscent of those in bars and The Big Lebowski.  D was coming in and out of sleep, but we were still holding \'conversation\' through sounds rather than words, at least that\'s how I remember it.  I\'m starting to feel an upset stomach and disorientation, but I\'m not convinced whether it is my body or my mind.  By 4:30 I\'m pretty sure we were both asleep, D was convinced that we were in trouble.    7:30 am: My dad gets home from work and my mom is getting ready for work, while D and I are sleeping on the living room floor.  I awake to my mom talking to me about her job, something I find annoying when I\'m straight seems impossible to handle like this.  I cover my head with blanket and D whispers \'I think we\'re in big trouble\' and falls back asleep.      10:30 am: I wake to my cellphone alarm feeling really well.  I get up to take a shower and tell D that I have to work at 11:30.  After the shower, D gets up and head\'s home, I go to work.  The rest of the day, I felt slow and slightly disoriented, but not sick or hungover.      The experience with H.B. Woodrose was for me, a good one.  Although it was probably not the best choice psychedelic to start on, I learned a lot about the \'trip\' as well as helping a friend on a bad ride.  There were intense changes in my mood and thoughts, I am very sure that Woodrose and the marijuana influenced these changes.  Perceptions that I would take in sober were amplified in my mind under the influence of these substances.  The whole experience lasted nearly 12 hours, most of it enjoyable.  I look forward to another experience that will be even better than this.      -B      (7/13/2006)"
52159,A Psychedelic Legal High,Jaycalzone,"Aug 24, 2008","Nutmeg, H.B. Woodrose & Alcohol","I wanted to experiment with nutmeg, as I have taken it a few times but haven\'t had any breakthrough experiences. I ingested about 0.5 oz. of nutmeg at 1:30 pm and it took me about 30 minutes to consume it all. I knew it was going to take several hours to hit the plateau, so I just went to class and waited. I ate 9 H.B. Woodrose seeds about 3 hours later, at 5 pm.  I was attempting to get both of the highs at exactly the same time, and let me tell you, I did.     It must have been around 8:30 or a little while earlier when I noticed effects that I never have on any other drug, granted I haven\'t taken any psychedelics before. I was sitting at my desk and I noticed that the peoples\' voices in the hallway stated to sound strange. They sounded distant and distorted, not to mention that the voices sounded much louder. A few minutes later, they sounded all jumbled up and I couldn\'t make out any single person as it was just a bunch of noise resembling people.    Having this be a new experience for me, I got scared and really started tripping. At this point I lied on my bed and closed my eyes. Immediately I noticed my CEVs, a series of rainbow colored fractals and other random shapes with the same color pattern, like looking through a kaleidoscope. I opened my eyes and noticed that very similar OEVs were taking place as well, although they would become stronger later. They were not overpowering but they were very cool.     Although I was still worried and skeptical of what was to come, I tried to relax, but things were just too foreign for me and I freaked out. I got off my bed and I was bombarded with such profound thoughts about myself and my life, what have I done, what kind of person am I, what if I die. All very serious questions that made me terribly uneasy and more scared. I remember reading similar reports with psychedelics, so I eventually was able to overcome my fears. To help calm myself down, I turned on some music, and I was immediately aware how high I was.    I began listening to The Dark Side of the Moon first, and it was obviously playing much slower than usual, telling me that I was very high. I was wondering what would make the experience even stronger when I noticed my synesthesia. I had also read about this happening very frequently with psychedelics and it was then that which told me that I was officially tripping. I got very excited and upbeat because I had always to trip but I could never get my hands on acid. The first thing I noticed was that I could see the music, mostly in the form of the fractals and colorful shapes I had noticed earlier.     I really saw I had visual hallucinations because I was watching South Park on tv and the characters were out of focus, blurry, or otherwise distorted. This was overwhelming for me so I turned off the tv. I now realize that watching the tv or a movie probably would have been very rewarding, so I want to try it next time I trip. I returned to my computer desk and tried to type to my friends, but the trails and visuals were too strong. The trails were so strong that I remember looking at my hands while typing and it was just a big blur of trails. It looked like special effects from a movie. This was one of the coolest moments of the night. I looked at the screen and it appeared to be magnified and coming out at me, also a very cool effect.     I gave up typing because I really wanted to enjoy my trip and relax. Now that I was completely into the trip, I put Pink Floyd back on and this time it was even slower. It seemed like it may stop completely if I was any higher (and it almost did!) I then decided to grab some beers to see if they would multiply my trip. I was dehydrated from the nutmeg so drinking beer on top probably was dangerous (I was drinking water too). I noticed that because of the synesthesia I couldnt taste the beer or feel the burden of the carbonation. Therefore I was able to drink the beers fast and without problem. They hit me hard but enjoyably and greatly multiplied the high. The music sounded as great as ever and very rich and deep.     All this while the OEVs were continuing to occur. Another note about the synesthesia: I noticed that I couldnt feel or hear myself breathe, but rather I could only hear a strange whistle or buzzing noise each time I inhaled. It sounds crazy, but it was very entertaining at the time. Four beers later I was the highest Ive ever been in my entire life. The trip is so smooth and enjoyable now. I put on St. Peppers and sit down to play Mario Kart next. The game was highly enjoyable and it seemed to be playing in slow motion. After playing it for some time, I decided to go back strictly to music. I sat at my desk and listened to another CD or two.    I began to get very tired and I lied down in bed with Pink Floyds Animals playing. I must have fallen asleep sometime soon after lying down. Although it seems that I went to bed prematurely, the trip itself had worn off considerably and the psychedelic effects were all but gone. I was still very high from the nutmeg and the seeds had a lingering buzz that was enjoyable. I was able to sleep only for short periods of time all the next morning, but I wasnt too tired the next day. When I woke up I had a terrible ringing in my ears and a faint heartbeat, both of which worried me somewhat. I got up to get water and I noticed that I had blurry vision and the lights were so overwhelming in the hall that I almost blacked out. I could feel and see myself starting to slip into unconsciousness so I closed my eyes, grabbed a gulp of water, and quickly made my way back to my room to lie down.    I drank a lot of water the next day and I quickly felt better, leading me to believe that if I had drank a lot of water during the trip I most likely would have no ill effects the next day. I have told all of my friends about my experience and I already have some people that want to trip with me soon. This makes me very happy. I plan on upping the dosage of both the nutmeg and the seeds for the next trip, hopefully wielding stronger results.     Happy Tripping!"
38141,A Defining Night,Sage,"Mar 2, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"Pre-script: I was about 2 weeks off of the Nuvra Ring (birth control) at this point, and I might have still had some hormonal imbalances at the time.    Up until this point my husband and I had only dabbled in research chemicals, but thanks to the DEA this is no longer possible. So we turn to the natural world to follow in the footsteps of our ancestors, and use plants as a way to find the cosmic. The last thing I did before this experience was about two or three months ago, and it was definitely not very strong. My husband (D) and I were getting put out by the experiences we were having on psychedelics, and had stopped for a while. We acquired some seeds from a trusted source, and they arrived on a Friday afternoon. Not having any plans, we decided to ingest them. We had eaten at Taco Bell around 12:30 that afternoon, 5 hour prior. After spending an hour or so relaxing to try and get into a more calm state of mind, we ate (chewed up) 7 seeds, fuzzy husk and all, and used water to wash them down (this was around 6 ish). We also had about half of a soft corn tortilla each, to give our stomach something to work on along with the seeds. I experienced some mild nausea at first, but that abated once I ate the tortilla.    After about 10 minutes, I definitely wasnt baseline, and after about 30 I could really tell something was going on. It was not very specific, and I was trying to be patient but D was becoming more and more happy and excited, so I decided to eat two more seeds since my body weight is greater than Ds and I thought perhaps I was metabolizing differently or something. Up until this point we had been in the living room, sitting in our desk chairs in front of the stereo, listening to Max Graham, something we always do while tripping - having familiar music helps me a lot in navigation of the ether. After I ingested the seeds we went into the bedroom to lay down on the bed. I was beginning to feel chilly, so I covered up with our queen sized light blanket.     I felt I was in a cocoon, the whole universe spread out and finally feeling my limits, everything beyond the blanket was the other, the other half of the universe, the part that no one in the universe understands. D is my god, speaking to me from this other half, helping me to realize what it is to be the universe. I was very happy, realizing my true nature, being with the one that I love. I came out of the blanket and pulled Ds clothes off, as well as mine. We rolled onto the floor and just experienced the carpet, the world, the air. At this point, neither of us has much of a recollection of exactly what we were doing, but soon after I found myself laying on the floor, having a very difficult time moving. Imagine that all the strength has been taken out of your limbs, this was how I felt. I could not have stood up for anything, which scared me very much, because if the house had caught fire, I would not have been able to move. D was helping me, talking to me, tho he was tripping hard too - but on 7 seeds he had more mobility than I did, tho later reported feeling tired and sapped of strength as well. I lay on the floor, until D told me I should get up on the bed with him, which I did, using all my willpower.    I felt myself being way too far gone, and asked D to turn off the music. Again, I dont remember what happened immediately after, but about 10 minutes later I went into the bathroom and threw up, just a lot of water and bile. I brushed my teeth, which felt really good, and came back in the bedroom to be with D. After this point, the only thing D and I really remember was being sick. It didnt happen immediately, but soon after we were in the bathroom, I had just finished throwing up again, and was starting to feel really bad - the sapping of willpower and strength catching up to me. D had been complaining of nausea for about a half hour, but could not throw up. All of a sudden, D flung himself at the toilet and vomited very forcefully. This was very scary to me, as I had never seen my husband sick, and he was always my anchor during trips which sometimes turned out to be scary, or going into territory I felt I wasnt ready for yet.    Well, seeing him be sick made me sick, and I ran into the other bathroom and was as sick as I have ever been in my life. D and I stayed that way for about 10 minutes, him in one bathroom, me in another, calling back and forth Are you ok? I was very very ill, to the point to wanting to call someone, but not knowing what anyone could do. I literally thought I was going to die. Listen to me when I say this - I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE - totally convinced that my heart was going to stop with my next breath, either that or Id throw up again and choke myself, because I was so weak I felt I couldnt do anything but puke out of every orifice in my head. I was terrified, I felt alone in the universe, totally alone, devoid of love, feeling about to die, feeling I was going to die naked on the bathroom floor. I yelled to D Im going to die! and he yelled back No youre not! He helped me have the determination not to die, just by telling me I wasnt going to. I dont know what would have happened if he had not been there, but Im glad he was.    After an indeterminate amount of time (HBWR made time pass in a very very strange way, it was really hard to tell what time it was), perhaps 5 minutes, D came in to check on me, and told me he was sorry about the mess in the other bathroom (he had missed the toilet a little), and I felt as low and horrid as I ever have. I felt like the love D and I share was based solely on tripping, and now that we had a bad trip, we would not love each other anymore. D kept telling me he loved me and he was sorry, and this made the feeling worse because I felt he was sorry that we didnt love each other anymore. I was at the bottom of humanity, I had touched death without crossing over to the other side, and now I was at the most horrid place a human being could ever reach. All I could do was sit, exhausted, on the floor with the light off, D in the doorway, with my head on my hand, clutching the lip of the toilet, clenching my teeth every time the drug would make another wave (as I was coming down the drug came on in waves, gradually decreasing) and using all my strength to talk to D, simple sentences, asking him if he was there, if he still loved me, if we were ok, if he was ok. D sat down beside me, propping himself up on the door, and we talked like this, simply, for a while.     Eventually I felt well enough to sit up, but that involved just taking my head off the toilet bowl. As I gradually got stronger, I felt like I was coming up through all the stages of humanity, starting at the lowest point and getting higher, with D being there all the while telling me he loved me and I was so wonderful. I got stronger and stronger, D coaching me through growing, until he told me he loved me and I realized I still loved him back, always had, even though I forgot for a time. I started gushing how much I loved him, this progressing into me realizing I loved everyone, everyone in the world, since I am the universe and everyone is me and I am everyone. I loved myself as well, something that up until now Ive been struggling with, but I realized I was perfect, and I sat on the floor crying saying how much I loved everyone, and D told me to look at him and give it all to him, give all the love to him, which I did, every ounce, every drop.    I then realized that some people didnt know I loved them and were sad, and I started crying again, harder this time, being so sad that people didnt love me and all I wanted to do was make them know I loved them, that they were wonderful, and as I was sitting there crying, D said But you know, theyre just pretending not to know, and I looked at him and laughed and said Yeah, youre right - Id forgotten! So we sat together on the floor, loving each other, feeling better and better. D stood up and told me to join him, so that we could be Gods together, and he walked and I crawled into the den adjoining the bathroom. I supplicated myself at his feet, worshipping my husband as God, him rubbing my back and telling me how much he loved me, how wonderful I was, and how I was just like him. I was feeling better and better, stronger and stronger. Eventually I stood up, which made me dizzy, and we walked around a little bit, brushing our teeth, washing our hands, hugging, kissing, and feeling very much in love, but still woozy and weak.    We were exhausted. We got some apple juice, because I felt part of the reason we still felt bad was due to a drop in blood sugar from not eating - we also took a multivitamin. I called my work to tell them that I had been very sick and wouldnt make it in the next day. I think I sounded ok on the phone but you never know. We fell into bed, holding each other, while I rode out the last of the waves of the drug, each time having to clench my teeth and breathlessly whisper Another wave - stay with me D so that D wouldnt go to sleep, as he was mostly down by this point. This was around 1 am, about 7 hours after ingestion. I was so tired, every once of energy drained away, but unable to fall asleep until the drug thoroughly metabolized. Eventually we fell asleep, cradled in each others arms.     I woke up once, when it was still dark, and went to the bathroom. I still didnt feel baseline at this point. I woke up around 10:40 the next morning, D soon after, and we felt sore, and tired, but more of the tired that youd feel after youd hiked all the previous day. We drank more apple juice, I got some yogurt, I still didnt feel totally ok, but more in the feeling kinda weird way than in the still tripping way. We curled back up with each other and slept until about 2. Then got up, made muffins (we were ravenous!), cleaned the bathroom, watched a movie, took a shower, went to the store, ate dinner, and are feeling generally wonderful, in love, happy, horny, and a little sore the next day.    This is a very very potent drug!  However, this was by far the most profound and defining trip I have ever had, including my first one (which is always supposed to be the most memorable, right?). All of the stress and negativity I have built up is gone, my mindset is totally different, D and I are the happiest weve ever been, and we didnt think we could get any happier. This was a defining night for me, and I encourage you to think seriously about trying this, but please, be safe, because I dont want anyone to have to feel as bad as I did at one point and be alone. Safe journeys, I love you all!"
37201,A Month of Use,Griegh,"Jan 26, 2008",H. B. Woodrose & Anadanthera colubrina,"To whom it may concern:    Unlike many other experiences that I have read, I will try to write this with as much neutrality as I can.  For the past 2 months I have been ingesting at least 4 seeds worth of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose (henceforth HBWR) everyday and up to 8 seeds (rarely).  My experience has been as follows:    Weeks 1 and 2:    Same as usual HBWR experiences: enchanted moments, time dilation, random (extremely clear) thoughts, excessive chattering (aloud and otherwise).  I was eating the seeds directly which causes serious digestive problems if one gets carried away (which I did).  For the most part I was able to ignore these problems for at least the first 2 weeks.  I am currently studying the Chinese language and I did notice that I was able to focus on memorizing characters while I was under the influence of the seeds.  So not much interesting going on these weeks.    Weeks 3 and 4:    I\'ve come to the point where I can no longer remember \'ordinary\' reality.  The very admission of this sends twinges of the flashback persuasion up my spine.  I have had countless encounters with nature that I can only describe as surreal.  I will list those that I can remember (this was a month ago) below:    1. The Squirrel Council:    I was wandering through the courtyard of my school after downing an ethanol extraction from HBWR seeds raw (its in the dictionary under supernasty) and suddenly the flow of time nearly stopped.  That is to say, that my perception of time changed as to make it appear as if time had stopped (very important).  I stumbled upon three squirrels locked in some sort of \'wisemen\'s council\'.  Allow me to explain:  they were standing on the vertices of what looked (from my angle) like an equilateral triangle staring at each other completely still.  So still that I almost didn\'t see them standing on the middle of the sidewalk.    2. Man vs. Squirrel    Don\'t ask me why the squirrel motif, I am only reporting.  Here comes squirrel story number 2.  I was walking up to class after drinking a straight up water exract of HBWR chased with orange juice and I noticed a squirrel burying some nuts.  I took note that the squirrel took many precautions in concealing the location of his precious nuts, though my mother tells me that he forgets where they are half the time anyway.  I spent a lot of time thinking about this experience and a few days later I saw another squirrel, or perhaps the same one, they all look the same to me, just finishing up burying his (or her) nuts.    This time, I waited till he began to walk away and then I snuck over to the spot where he buried them and pretended like I was digging them up.  When I looked over to see his/her reaction, the thing was standing on its hind legs flailing its front legs around in the air, clearly agitated by what I was doing, and making this absurd squeaking noise, similar to a squirrel calling another squirrel but more intense I guess is the word.  After a few moments of that I began to walk away only to be followed for a good long way by the squirrel who I can only assume was spying to see where I planted his/her nuts.  This may not sound like much of a story but think about the contents of it and you just may realize what it means.    Okay, let\'s skip to last week, that\'s when things get interesting:    My botanicals supplier sends me some Cebil seeds (Anadenanthera Colubrina, I hope that\'s the correct spelling) because I ordered so many damn HBWR seeds I guess.  By this time my small intestine probably looks like some sort of putrid rancid swiss cheese and I haven\'t had a normal bowel movement (aka \'shit\') in weeks.  Every time I sit on the can it\'s either this green baby shit or a full on ass-plosion.  If you\'re still reading, I apologize but I wouldn\'t feel right if I didn\'t tell you the truth.      Anyway, so immediately when I got the Cebil seeds I started grinding them up and smoking them.  This was all while I was under the influence of the HBWR seeds.  Smoking any sort of seeds is generally a bad idea but I don\'t have that many of these and don\'t plan to buy any (sorry botanical supplier!) so I thought it would be ok.  The first time I smoked the seeds here\'s what happened:    The Eye of God Burns the Mountain:    I just finished my last \'hit\' of the seed smoke.  I looked into the sky.  In incredible detail there was an eye formed in the clouds with light (sunlight) pouring out of it.  I began fearing for my life as this situation seemed similar to what happens in movies when someone dies and the heavens open up and receive them.  It didn\'t take me long to figure out that if I were dying, heaven would NOT be receiving me (if indeed god is \'the good guy\').  I took comfort in that fact but I found a new fear welling up inside me.  What if this eye was looking for me?  In retrospect, this may have been some sort of psychotic episode because the fear was all too real and staggering not like normal LSD or mushrooms \'bad trip fear\' which I have also experienced and been able to shrug off pretty easily.  Oh yeah, the Cebil dose was light, only 2 seeds smoked, but I think it was the combination of Cebil with HBWR that pushed me to the limit.    Finally, we come to the present. I have regrettably picked up smoking cigarettes again, after quitting for 8 months, which I think is largely due to the Cebil addition to my repertoire.  I have almost finished with my last batch of HBWR which I have been aching to rid myself of ever since I had a stabbing pain in my gut which I am certain is a result of the badness contained therein.    As you\'ve probably noticed (if you are still reading) that my daily dose was extremely low compared to what most people would consider a \'decent acid trip\'.  This was deliberate because I was doing this while running a normal life and not really letting anyone know (except my closest friends) what I was doing.  I leave you with this,    quest not for knowledge,  quest not for wisdom,  but quest for the annihilation of self,  because that\'s all you\'re going to get!"
36097,"A Sympathy of Crickets, An Ocean of Color",Upiyano,"Jan 5, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"A week ago I had a really good time by grinding 8 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds, soaking in water for two days, and drinking the water. I planned to make this trip more powerful than the last, so I ground up 9 seeds and just downed them with chamomile tea at about midnight. I told my sister I what I was doing in case I needed her and went to my room.    A Symphony of Crickets:  I spent the come up just listening to music and talking on the internet; I was enjoying the trippy feelings.    After awhile I decided to put Mira Calix\'s Nunu set on. It is a 20 minute composition made only from the sounds of insects, it\'s quite amazing. While listening to the music I could make myself think I was outside listening to a symphony of insects with my fan blowing lightly over my body. It seemed very erotic to me, intensifying as the song got louder. After listening to the set twice I decided I should see where else Mira could bring me. It was interesting listening to her other compositions and I could imagine myself in strange alien worlds; for awhile I thought I was swimming through an undersea world which almost seemed like a video game. Mira Calix makes amazing trip music.    When I finished listening to the music I realized I was feeling nauseous and went outside so I could throw up if I needed (I didn\'t). I lay on a sleeping bag in my backyard with my eyes closed listening to a calmer symphony of crickets before heading back inside. After spending some time talking on IRC I decided to sleep and turned my music off. This is where things got fun.    An Ocean of Color:  Before long I realized I wasn\'t in my bedroom anymore. I was in an ocean of colors, all flowing together. I felt lost and didn\'t know if I would ever come back, despite constantly reminding myself I was on a drug. Eventually I opened my eyes or woke up (I\'m not sure what it was).    I knew I was in my house but everything seemed strange and I was really confused. I heard my dad getting up to make coffee and debated going out to talk to him. While in my room I kept trying to grab onto solid things. I felt like I needed something concrete to hold on to because the ocean of color was too smooth and undefined. One thing that really sticks out to me is looking at my wall and seeing all the bumps and crevices as I dragged my fingers across it. Eventually I had to talk to my dad, so I left my room.    Understanding Myself and Family:  Before continuing I should let you know my parents are relatively ok with drug use. My dad was in his twenties and in Berkeley during the \'60s so you can imagine what he is like.    When I went out my dad was confused at first but after I told him what I took he seemed to understand exactly how to help me. I don\'t remember what he said to me but it changed my mood completely. My sister must have heard us talking because she came out and talked with us for awhile. Eventually my mom came out too and we began talking about spiritual things. I realized that the ocean of color was like a pool of energy that everything flows into and out of, a will of the universe you could say. I knew that everyone and everything is connected and everything affects everything else. Chaos theory seems to be the best way to describe it. In fact, it\'s exactly what chaos theory is about.    As I was realizing that everyone is connected I also realized that, just like in chaos theory, patterns can emerge. Patterns are like people, animals, and objects. They create a pattern (a shape, conscious thought, whatever) out of the void and create our world. An example would be a nebula forming into a star.    I also understood that there are different kinds of people in different parts on different parts of a spectrum. An example we used was how my sister hates the bible and what it stands for. To her the bible is unneeded and she believes it is a horrible set of teachings in part because she doesn\'t need it. On the other had, fanatic christians do need it. It\'s an essential part of who they are and it\'s silly to get caught up worrying about what is and isn\'t important to them. I realized that I have to live in the now and not worry about the past and future to the point of obsession.    While it became a truly difficult experience for me I\'m grateful that it happened. I really allowed me to change for the better."
41871,I Am,Emerald,"Dec 30, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"After having tried many of the \'legal\' highs, including DXM, salvia, sinicuichi, and amanita muscaria, along with some prescriptions (opiods and muscle relaxers), my interest turned to this little plant called Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.    Before this, I\'d tried some dissociatives, deliriants, and such (see above), but never gotten very impressive results. DXM managed to make me feel horrible for six hours, dramamine was comparable to self-induced schizophrenia. I had thought that I might never enjoy the \'psychedelic\' drugs and that they were a waste of my time. But oh, was I wrong.    I decided on a pretty average dose, 5 seeds, taken orally without any special preparation at 4:45pm. I knew about the nausea; fortunately I had only consumed liquids that day. Afterwards, I decided to take a shower so that I would be in the right place if extreme nausea hit. About an hour after, I started to feel the nausea, but it wasn\'t overpowering.    About two hours after the dose, I began to feel heavy and lucid. I realized that I was having trouble focusing. I lied down and a sense of vertigo seemed to come over me; it was as if the room were spinning. My thoughts were becoming jumbled; it was as if my mind were confused. An extreme kind of physical discomfort came over me. I realized I was having trouble breathing and that my heart was pounding rapidly. At the time, I had some allergies and had taken pseudoephedrine HCl beforehand. I\'m not sure if this could have contributed to it. I calmed down somewhat but was then interrupted by my mother, who came in and claimed I had a phone call. With great effort, I managed to explain that I wasn\'t feeling well. Talking coherently was becoming difficult.    I realized then that I was beginning to lose control of my mind, much like LSD, and that I needed to get myself to a safe and private place where I would not be interrupted again. So, I got up and locked myself in the bathroom and took a bath. Eventually, I could not hold myself up and simply lay on the floor. This is where a seemingly unpleasant experience changed drastically.    Suddenly, I was not myself anymore. I was everything. I became the universe, life, death, all consciousness at once. I wondered if I was dying. Fears flashed through my mind - what if my mother found me here, dead? But no, I reassured myself, no one has died from these little seeds. I felt suddenly incredible. I was united with the universe, while staring up at the bathroom ceiling. Revelations pounded my mind, as my heart pounded along in unison. Are we all like this, connected? Are we all.. one? What am I? I.. am. I breathed, and it felt like life itself was flowing through my lungs. I got up, and I realized my eyes were more dilated than I had ever seen them before. I went back to my room and stared out the window in awe. How beautiful everything was!    Portions of the trip were not as pleasant. After this, my mind dwelled on broken relationships I had been avoiding. I actually began to cry, wondering why I had let these precious things fall apart. Then I came to several profound realizations about these things which I owe to the Woodrose. I woke up the next morning feeling as if I had experienced a great catharsis, and that many of my burdens had been lifted from me. I felt an overwhelming love of nature and creation, and that I had been redeemed by God.    From what I read later, much of what I experienced is comparable to a full blown LSD experience, minus visuals. I plan on taking another journey with Woodrose very soon. I may increase the dose slightly, but 5 seeds seemed to be pretty adequate for me."
65070,Peruvian Magic,Trolly,"Nov 16, 2007","Cacti - T. peruvianus, Morning Glory, H.B. Woodrose, Mushrooms, Calamus, Kava & Ginseng","::Substances-Doses::  mescaline/peruvian torch - 240ml liquid extract  hawaiian babywoodrose/lsa - 20 seeds  morning glory/lsa - 20 seeds  acoru calamus - 2g extract  kava kava - unknown dose  gingseng - unknown dose  psilocybin/mushrooms - 2g      **11:40PM**  I waited until it was late so that most people within my neighborhood would be asleep, and not effect the tranquility I require in my meditations. I began by consuming the liquid extract of Peruvian Torch since (for me) it takes longer to become active then the other substances, which I planned to take within 15-20 minutes hoping all the substances would become active together. The Peruvian Torch had a soapy/oily feel in my mouth but otherwise the taste was very bearable, though, the more I drank I seemed to get a full feeling in my stomach as if I had eaten 10 steaks and needed to purge them despite the normal taste.    **12AM**  Following the ingestion of the Peruvian Torch I began mixing the ground Morning Glory & Woodrose seeds with the Kava/Gingseng/Calamus powder extract into multiple capsules, then proceeded to ingest them. After I had finished swallowing the capsules, I ingested the 2 grams of mushrooms. At this point I was surprised by how extremely tired I had become. I decided to enjoy some television instead of the continual hours of meditation I normally preceed upon when I ingest psychoactives. I would have fallen asleep in the lotus position as I\'ve done many times :)    **1:20AM**  The substances had to my surprise began to take effect quickly, normally mescaline would take 2-3 hours to kick in. This also being the first time I\'ve mixed these exact substances together, I was surprised to notice how calming the mescaline experience was in comparison to the speediness and fast visual tracers normally experienced. This was probably from the calamus/gingseng/kava I had added. At this point the visuals were in fact very similar to 300-400mcg of LSD in that the visuals had a slow peaceful flow to them over the fast overwhelming experiences of just mescaline alone.    **2AM**  After watching tv and finding nothing interesting I decided to lay on my back and enjoy the show my mind was putting on for me, still amazed by how the Mescaline seemed completely masked by the LSA & Psilocybin. So much so that if I wasn\'t the one who prepared the mixture I would not think Mescaline was active within me at all, I layed and watched my curtains wave about as if a breeze was flowing through them yet the window was closed.    **2:30AM**  Having to urinate, I left my room and upon entering the bathroom I noticed the toilet flusher/handle was going up and down as if it was flushing itself. I chuckled and noticed my vision had faded slightly as if i was wearing sunglasses, I began to wabble as I walked back to my room. Having heavily used these substances individually and some minor mixes, I knew this was the LSA/Acoru/KAVA reaching their full strength. The rest of the nite continued like this, very peaceful, nothing like I expected to experience especially with the Mescaline I had included.    **10AM**  When I had awakened there was a pleasant after glow, a sense of clarity without intoxication, increased energy and will to complete tasks as well without the caffeine feeling that comes with an afterglow.    **Summary**  It seemed like a risky mix but, all in all this mixture was very pleasant and calming, no overwhelming feelings or negative thoughts, great come down and afterglow.    *Quick Backround*  This information is strictly in reference to my psyche so that one may have a closer understanding of my perspective through this experience. I\'m a cancer survivor who found spirituality through use of hallucinogens, I\'ve partaken in many ritual substances including, Ayahausca, LSD, Psilocybin, LSA, Mescaline, Amanitas Muscaria, Salvia Divinorum, Ketamine, Salu Henbane, and quite literly 30-40 other substances from around the world. Iv used these substances in meditative states lasting at times Days, all together I would say I have had around 500 individual hallucinogenic experiences."
55874,A Rollercoaster Ride At A Snail\'s Pace,KeyKnee,"Oct 16, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"After using alcohol and marijuana for some years, myself and 3 friends decided it was time to branch out a little and explore the somewhat more interesting side to psychoactives. Exploits with MDMA and Salvia had produced interesting results, and   after reading up on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and finding them for sale on the internet, we decided to order 8 each and see what the outcome would be.    Our method of ingestion would be a simple water extraction. The furry material around the seeds was picked off by hand. The seeds were then ground up and put into 500mls of water, with 8 ground up seeds to each 500mls. These were left to stand in 500ml bottles for 24 hours and were shaken occasionally, turning the water a dark green/brown.  As the time came to do the seeds, we filtered the water using a simple tea strainer, which still left small particles in the solution, threw away the mush, and mixed the dark water with fruit juice (50/50).    We all managed to consume our 8 seeds worth of water each in the space of about 10 minutes. It created a very heavy feeling in the stomach, and produced considerable gas and cramping. The nausea wasn\'t too intense, and quite bearable, and we were all in a fine mindset and very much looking forward to the experience. We had one sitter, who was a brother of one of the 3 friends, and we had known him for years. The rest of the evening, which took place next to a large tree on a small field close to where we lived, went as follows:    7.00pm - An hour after ingestion, and stomach still feels quite tender. Can feel a very slight change in perception, but unable to tell if this is a placebo effect. Sitting/lying down is more pleasant than standing, and feeling quite lethargic.    8.30pm - Stomach discomfort starting to ease, and we are subtly becoming affected. Effects at this stage are essentially comparable to being drunk, without the mental impairment, although with slight blurred vision. Me and 2 of my friends pop to a supermarket down the road to get a snack, and inside the store it is very enjoyable - everything feels completely different, seeming alot more vivid and colourful, almost magical. Also, the people in there walking around seem robotic, almost like drones. The sky is a pleasing shade of orange when we leave, which adds to the pleasurable effects.      9:30pm - Back at the tree it has become dark now, although the sky is still quite colourful. Effects are now completely tangible, including a light \'buzzing\' sensation, almost like a mild dose of MDMA, coupled with distortions in spatial perception. We notice how walking through the grass makes us feel very small, like we are very close to the ground, but standing still and staring at our feet makes us feel very tall. The darkness may have added to this. Also, lights such as the moon, streetlamps, start to glow more vividly, and also become quite blurry around the edges (more so than normal). Apart from these, no actual \'visuals\' as such are reported. The experience so far is definitely positive.    10:00pm - The beginning of the downward turn. We are sitting down making idle talk when I get up to urinate, and I pick a bush that is about 15 metres away. When I have finished, and am just about to return to the group, I start to get very vivid flashbacks from childhood, and start to feel an intense sadness. I stand there, motionless, as small \'films\' in my head play back of my mother making me and my friends sandwiches after we had come in from playing, my first day at school, and how my dad used to take me out cycling and walking. I feel like I want to pay them back for all the good they had done to me down the years. I want to return to that age of innocence and love that adolescence leaves behind. This is rather unnerving and difficult to shake off.    After around 10 minutes of this, I try to stifle the thoughts for a while and return to the group. One of my friends is lecturing the other about how mankind has become \'poisoned\' by modern technology and fashion and other things that have taken him away from nature, and that we have all become \'sick animals\', confused and diseased by the industrialised world around us. This is a concept I find interesting, and I want to join in, but am still experiencing flashbacks and I sit next to them for a further 10 minutes, moaning and feeling like I am going mad. At this stage there is a very strong sense of a change in reality, that we are not really \'all there\' with respect to life as we know it, like everything we see in the distance like cars and trees are just a movie set, unimportant and unreal.    My flashbacks start to weaken and I start to join in the conversation, which is now reaching it\'s morbid peak. The friend doing the lecturing is wailing that we will have to revert back to being animals and not join the sick people and that we will never recognise our families when we go back home to them as they are sick people as well. I quickly become sucked in and before we know it we all have a belief that we are aliens in a very screwed up world and it feels as though we are walking a very fine line between sanity and insanity. It is as though all the filters that my brain uses to discard silly/unintelligible points made in a conversation are completely gone. You could make me believe anything you wanted them to, no matter how wild. Interestingly, the third friend, who has been sitting up in the tree since this insanity started, has been able to distance himself from our anguish, saying he is finding the experience very pleasurable, and that we should \'go with the flow\' like he is.    11.00pm - Me and my two friends that I\'m cracking up with decide to head back to the supermarket we went to earlier to pick up some Neurofen tablets, which contain Ibuprofen and Codeine, to try and calm us down. To our despair, the pharmacy section   is closed, so we leave. As we walk out of the entrance, the friend who was lecturing earlier starts complaining of a pain on his forearm, and holds his arms out and points to a rather minor looking swelling on one of his arms. We insist that it\'s probably an insect bite or a nettle sting, and that he probably has \'the fear\', but this only makes him more paranoid, and he says he is getting a taxi to the local hospital because he \'doesn\'t know how much longer he has left\'. Me and the remaining friend are feeling very paranoid and anxious at this point, and we ring the other two at the tree to tell them what\'s happened, and they say they think they\'ll go home as they\'re getting bored, and offer us to go with them as our pupils were as big as saucers. After we had been back at theirs for half an hour, the bad part of the trip fades away, and everything feels very pleasant and mellow.     3.00am - The last few hours have been spent simply sitting around and chatting, and we still feel definitely \'affected\', but in a much better state of mind than earlier, very mellow and calm. Feeling quite hot and sweaty (another MDMA-like effect of the seeds) and have been drinking a fair amount of water. Our friend at the hospital phones to say he has been given an X-ray and a blood test, and that they have sent him home. He puts his reaction down to extreme paranoia, and is feeling better.     4.00 am - Have nearly returned to baseline, and we lie down to go to sleep. Sleep after the seeds is very pleasant. I am lying on the hard floor of my friend\'s room with a jacket for a pillow and it feels like pure luxury.     In conclusion, we had quite a rollercoaster ride on the seeds, but because the \'coming up\' stage is so slow and subtle, and the trip is so long in duration, it\'s a very unusual feeling and we were definitely caught by surprise once we found our consciousness changing. Although the middle of the trip was at times terrifying, I found it to still be a valuable experience which taught me (and presumably my friends) alot more about my inner self, and made me realise the power of my own mind. Most important of all, it taught me to have more respect for psychoactive substances, and not to go jumping in at the deep end. I think the bad part of our trip may have been avoided if we had been in a warm house and had something comfortable to lie on like a sofa, and if we had been able to focus on more pleasant things. These seeds were small, but they sure packed a punch."
24748,Gateways to Insanity,Catfish,"Oct 12, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"To begin with, a friend who regularly sold weed to my friends and I commented that a headshop near our home had a new line of legal highs available, and that out of curiosity and scepticism, he had decided to try woodrow (the name we gave it, its easier to say when your jaw doesn\'t work). He recommended it, even though he could get almost any substance, so we decided to give it a go. He said the minimum of the seeds we would need would be three, so between four of us we bought fourteen seeds. F took four seeds, S,D and I took three seeds each, and we threw one away because it was deformed. the trip as a whole was rather disappointing, we all suffered major tiredness, pains in the legs and very slight confusion. That afternoon we layed and watched various television until three am when we finally fell asleep. The trip was boring, if it was not for the immense fatigue and confusion, and difficulty moving from place to place, we had no real trip at all. We decided that the seeds were no good and decided to stick to hashish for the forseeable future until acid was available from the local dealers.    However, in May 2003 I had suffered a break up with my girlfirend of one year, and felt the need to do something to take my mind off of the situation. Foolishly i decided to invite the same three friends over and repeat the experince with more seeds. I went to the same headshop that day and bought 21 seeds. S,D and F all took 5 seeds, whereas I took 6. We ate them at about 8.30 and went to the local shop before they had kicked in. After leaving the shop the effects had begun already. The same crippling leg pains were present, as was tiredness and slight confusion.     The effects begun to climb, and by 10pm, F and I were having a very enjoyable time. We giggled and talked crazy things all safe in the knowledge that my brother, who was not on woodrow, was in the house in case anything went wrong. S reported that he was getting very few effects at all and was not sure if what he was getting was forced or genuine. D said very little apart from that he was getting something. Half an hour after this, I was tripping quite heavily, as was S and D was downstairs relaxing while F stood upright in the hall unable to move, giggling like a schoolgirl. S and I were upstairs listening to Tad, though not really taking in the music. After what seemed like a long time, everyone went back downstairs while I went to my room to call my girlfriend. I was still upset and wanted to straighten things out. I told her i was on woodrow and she understood, and tried to sooth me and not send me on a bad trip by saying anything upsetting. She told me some jokes and then I hung up and went to watch Tv with my friends.    After watching a very confusing cartoon, followed by more cartoons, we arrived at a show called \'Ned\'s Newt\', which simply must have been invented to scare people on woodrow. It was extremely confusing and I was having mild auditory hallucinations throughout it. Also I was repeatedly rubbing and poking and scratching my head without realising, like one second I would be sat enjoying the cartoon and then without warning or transition be pawing at my face. This freaked me out and I began to feel sick. I decided to go to my room and go to sleep. I left the guys downstairs, sure they would be fine.     As soon as I got inside my room I felt trapped, I was getting extremely bad vibes. I felt alone and like nobody would understand. I called my girlfriend up again and she said some stuff which I don\'t remember but I remember didn\'t help me. I thanked her anyway and layed down to go to sleep. Suddenly I felt really sick and had to get up to throw up. I threw up quickly in three bursts into the toilet, and despite my condition I managed to clean my bathroom and myself and I did a pretty darn good job. I went to bed feeling no better and closed my eyes.    Immediately I felt out of place. My room seemed huge, when I knew it was tiny, then felt even smaller, like a box. I was unaware of the postion of my body, i.e. I was touching one wall then the next with no apparent movement. I also had a few actual hallucinations, such as my wall being huge, and my radiator seemed very strange indeed. Also I couldn\'t stop thinking. The thoughts seemed to be patterned, as if I knew what thought was coming next, yet they were completely random. To top it all off I had extreme paranoia that my friends downstairs would be trashing the place. Then I held a small conversation with myself, speaking out loud, telling myself that they couldn\'t move, let alone trash the place. This cycle went on for about two hours. I finally passed out at about 3am.    When I awoke I felt better, I could still taste my vomit but I had my mind back. D had gone at about 6am because he couldn\'t sleep, F claimed to have had an amazing experience, and S also claimed that sleep was difficult because of thoughts. The whole day after I felt tired and was not content with watching TV, I felt I had to do something that took advantage of my seemingly increased intellectual power, but when I thought about this I thought that the drug may have lasting psychological effects, which worried me.  The thing that had happened both times was we had all shared symptoms that others had not reported, we hypothesized that this may be because of a psychosomatic response to the effects the others have. Many other things seemed to happen that night, too many to report, it was indeed unlike what we had imagined the first time around. I don\'t think that I would try it again, though F says he really wants to, but I am glad that I did it, for the experience."
55654,Just What I Needed,NVB,"Oct 7, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"First a bit of background about myself. I\'m 25, 6ft, well built, and have been regularly using drugs for about 3 and a half years, this has included a lot marijuana, a good number of experiences with ecstacy, magic mushrooms and cocaine (sometimes at the same time), ketamine once, pure mdma once, speed once, and small doses of mescaline three times. Basically I thought I could handle my drugs. I\'d tripped with mushrooms maybe 15 times, and had had bad experiences twice that had scared me a little at the time, but it was nothing compared to my HBW experience.    Also relevant to this report is that my mother died when I was 9 and it was an issue I have never really dealt with. Although I have confronted it and had counseling in the past, the pain is still inside and still very raw, although often repressed. Even so, I have a strong mind and a strong self-belief and have always felt I can get over it and one day be a whole and happy person.    ---    A good friend of mine and I got hold of 2 packs of these from a local headshop, 7 per pack. We had been planning to do them for a week or so, and a free weekend presented itself. I woke up on the day feeling a bit apprehensive, but talked myself into being ready and confident for this. I went over to his about 4 pm. At about 5 PM we ate 7 seeds each by peeling the outer fluffy skin and just munching them up in our mouths and swallowing. We lay down and listened to music and had a small spliff and some cigarettes.    We could slowly feel the affect increasing. Time seemed to pass quite slowly, I remember him checking the time and only an hour had passed, but it seemed like two. We talked and listened to music more, but I don\'t remember too much specifically. He decided to put on \'Where The Buffalo Roam\'. The effects were increasing and I was laughing like anything, and my legs were restless. As the film went on I was feel these affects more, and was lying there kicking my legs as though I was swimming. I was feeling absolutely fantastic, it felt like one of the best drug experiences.    Then things changed a bit. A friend of his texted him and said about going down to the pub for a drink. He thought this would be a good idea. I wasn\'t sure, but I was feeling good, and he talked me into it. We got ready and at about 9 PM walked to my house to get my jacket, and then set off into town. I started getting a fear about going to the pub. I stopped in a park off the road and explained to my friend. I am a shy person in many ways, and don\'t feel I can be myself unless with certain people, he being one of them. But I felt I wasn\'t capable of being myself in the pub, and this brought up issues regarding problems with relationships and my mum\'s death. I was crying at this point but felt better for getting it out. I dried my eyes and we continued into town feeling better about the situation, that this was a positive thing that I was learning to be myself, freeing my mind from the barriers that my psyche had put in place as a way of dealing her death. I shutdown emotionally and repressed and denied really ever since.    We got to the pub, and felt a bit self-conscious, but it was ok. We spoke with his friend and her friends. It was Sunday so it closed at 10:30, and we went and got a taxi home. We thought the trip was wearing off now and it dropped him at his house, and then me to mine. I got home and went to the toilet. As I sat there, bad thoughts started to hit me. For some reason, all I thought about killing myself. I tried to shake it, but it was there. This naturally scared me, and I hurridly pulled my trousers up and ran out of the house to try and clear my head. All I could think of was that now I was starting to confront her death that my life was no longer worth living, that the only way to be happy would be to kill myself so that maybe I could see her in heaven or some after-life if one exists. I could sort of talk myself away from these bad thoughts, only for them to come back again. I made myself a cup of tea and sat outside drinking that and having a cigarette to try and calm down. The bad thoughts came again and I turned to the one person who I have never been close to but should have been, my dad.    It was now 11:30. I called him and thankfully he answered. I didn\'t say what was happening, but I said I\'d been out and become a bit emotional about mum, and felt I was starting to really accept. I didn\'t say about the bad thoughts. He talked but I couldn\'t listen to all he was saying as my mind was racing. I got my coat and started walking into town again, because I wasn\'t sure speaking with him was going to help, so I headed toward the police station whilst speaking to him. I sat on a bench near there still speaking to him. I said that I was feeling a bit lost and confused about the situation and I just wanted to be at his house. He said did I want him to come down so I said yes. Then I thought about this, and thought shit I\'m tripping and dragging my dad into all this, and maybe I would calm down in a minute. But I confirmed and said to meet at my house. He lives about 45 minutes away, so I walked back to my house (I don\'t remember much of this) and sat outside and had a few more cigarettes, \'Everything will be ok now,\' I was thinking, although still some bad thoughts.    He turned up in good time, and I hugged him for the first time in my life. I made him a cup of coffee and we spoke, and then we drove back to his. I was feeling much better about things. He happened to mention in the car that LSD had been trialed in the 50s or 60s for pyschological use to help free problems, so then I admitted that I had done seeds containing LSA. The drive was pretty quick and we got in and I lay on the couch. We sat there with the tv on. He went to make a drink and the bad thoughts returned, and there was a feeling that this trip would never end, that I would be stuck in it for ever. So I had to go into the kitchen.    I went to the toilet and looked in the mirror. My face was getting thinner then fatter. I felt I didn\'t know who I was so I left the bathroom. I lay back on the couch and we sat there with the tv again. I could feel the affects wearing off, and could feel myself relaxing, and feeling more ready for sleep. He wished me good night, and I lay there with my eyes closed feeling ok, but with crazy whirling brightly coloured fine patterns. Although impressive, I didn\'t care for these, I justed to sleep! The patterns diminished and I got to sleep about maybe 5 AM, and slept for a few hours. I awoke feeling good, but still in a bit of confused state about what had happened.    It\'s now the evening and I\'ve had some time to reflect about the trip. Firstly, that it was the scariest experience of my life, having unwanted thoughts of suicide, or losing my mind and being stuck in a trip and never coming back. I\'ve been quite tearful today about the whole thing. I think I\'ve been in shock, and am now just taking it all in. I had a nasty car crash last year in which I could have easily been killed, which left me in a similar state, so I know the feeling.    Having said that, this experience may have given me exactly what I have been looking for for all these years. It feels now that my drug usage has all been away of searching for away to feel comfortable with who I am, and now finally at 25 I have that, and can begin the next step of the healing process and get on with my life, and be able to let a woman into my life as a partner. I\'m still undecided as to whether this is the end of drugs for me. I\'m defiantly not touching anything for a while till I recover from this, but maybe it is time to move on from them permanantly, maybe this is all I ever needed from them."
62977,The Mirror Game,Mithrandir,"Oct 1, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"This experience was most interesting to me as it was my first encounter with, what I consider to be, a strong psychedelic.  Other than marijuana, which I don\'t really consider that psychedelic, I had only done Salvia Divinorum, which was a profound, yet short, experience.  I was very much looking forward to an experience that lasted longer than 15 minutes.     The way that I came to obtain Hawaiian Woodrose seeds was rather unexpected, and completely unplanned.  A friend of mine had purchased a pack of 50 from an online store, tried them a couple times, and decided he didnt like them.  I was also, at this time, beginning to develop an interest in LSD as an alternative to mushrooms, which were apparently out of season.  So when my friend asked me if I was interested in purchasing the seeds from him, I figured that LSA as an alternative to my mushroom alternative was good enough.    Several nights after purchasing the beauties I concocted a tea consisting of 6 seeds ground to near oblivion sitting in some water, planning on using them for the weekend with my very best friend to look after me, just in case something went horribly wrong.  Nothing like a good pal.  However, being very late by the time I finished making the tea (and being that my late-night judgment is never sound), I came up with the brilliant idea of giving the seeds a little test run tomorrow at SCHOOL (quite possibly one of the worst settings imaginable\x85) with a slightly lower dose than what I already had brewing.      The night before, despite the fact of how tired I was, I began to adjust my mindset by telling myself to prepare for the worst but also to try my utmost to will it to be a positive experience.  And thats just what it came down to:  a battle of will.  Fortunately for me, my willpower seems to be exceptionally strong, because the first 4 hours of what would become 14 hours was a struggle indeed.  Well, more like parts of the first 4 hours.    I was also a bit tired in the morning when I administered my dose, but I am a happy person and am used to functioning when I am tired.  Not to mention I havent had an inkling of depression in years and years.    Okay, enough about me, lets talk about my other me.  Ill try to remember as best I can.    The Beginning  T+0:00  Ate 4 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds at 7.45am with some anxiety despite having bathed my mindset in positive, prepared thoughts.  I ate a very minimal amount of food before eating the seeds (mostly light, watery stuff that would come up easily if my body needed to purge), but drank lots of water and some ginger tea in the morning.  I feel that I cant stress enough how important it is to ingest some form of nausea-reducing herb or medicine before eating the seeds.  Ginger works but the taste seems a little odd in itself, at least to me anyway:  kind of rooty and spicy.  I kept having gross burps for about an hour after.  Eating the seeds was like eating bitterness.  There was no kind nuttiness to linger on, just an acerbic taste that stayed in my mouth for quite some time after.  The first small bit of queasiness seemed to creep up as soon as the seeds hit my empty stomach.    Mild Purgatory  T+1:00  For the past 60 minutes I had been dealing with a manageable amount of nausea.  Oh, and by \x91manageable I mean enough so that I go to the bathroom on several occasions during first period, intensely look myself in my slightly dilated pupils, and repeat You will not throw up, 4-5 times.  It did suck at first, but confronting myself in the mirror calmed me.  This was probably the most physically trying part of my experience.  I began to notice that my thoughts were slightly different, and came and went more quickly than usual.  I tended to cast more reflection on very small things that I would normally take for granted, like the nice, organic shape of a cello or the nasty, rigid shape of a chair.  Basically, anything that looked more \x91natural and \x91free felt better to look at, and received more positive thought from me.  Anything that was geometric or represented \x91order tended to receive criticism and produced a negative feeling in my mind.  I didnt really discriminate what I was looking at, though:  I felt everything deserved recognition.  With a bit of disappointment I also noticed that I was not acting at all myself on a social level, yet still felt that I was definitely me.  Conversation or any small remark of mine seemed to be very blunt and usually pointed out what probably was the painful truth (I say \x91probably because I dont know if it actually would be the truth under normal circumstances or if I was just perceiving it as the truth).  Not much of a body sensation other than the nausea, and no visuals to speak of (open- or closed-eyed).    Spreading My Roots  T+1:40  Fortunately, the nausea ceased by the end of first period, around 9.00am.  I think it was because we were playing a familiar drum cadence that made me feel happy.  Not euphoric happy, but happy.  I was mostly glad that I wasnt feeling as gross as I was before.  At break my thoughts were lucid and free-flowing, but not racing at an uncomfortable speed.  Now that the nausea had all but ended, I began to notice things.  My head felt weird, like a very mild marijuana high, so it wasnt too profound.  Things appeared as if my visions brightness was turned up a notch, but a small notch at that.  My friends noticed my pupils and asked me if I was high, but in response I told them I wasnt high so much as \x91altered.  Speech still came easily to me, but the way that I spoke was altered as well.  I would tend to use more elaborate wording, for some reason.  Also, certain things people said that I would typically regard as normal seemed somewhat silly (I would laugh at a few of these), and certain things that I would typically regard as odd subjects to talk about made sense.  In a mental sense, logic and appreciation were just plain reversed.  My physical sense had begun to change as well.  Not so much a \x91sensation, but rather along the lines of thinking I was standing with my legs spread slightly farther apart than they really were, then looking down at my feet and commenting Huh\x85thats strange, as I realized all was normal.  I was listening to Ummagumma: Live by Pink Floyd, which is an incredible album in its own respects, and I began to notice as the break progressed that it became increasingly more difficult to focus on what people were saying when I was listening to the music.  Off to next class.    Insight and Understanding  T+3:00  This class period is about the point in time where I came into contact with what I will call my first \x91loop, and also where the report becomes less of a record and more of a story.  Sitting in my chair during the telecasted announcements (which I had an utter lack of care for), I would position my hands, almost subconsciously, in a contemplative manner that kind of resembled making a gun with my hands, with my two index fingers resting on my lips.  I would be looking around at nothing in particular, because at this point everything seemed worthy of speculation, with a quiet smile on my lips.  However, I seemed to have an especially keen interest in my fellow human beings.  I felt that I had just realized how much depth there is beyond the surface personality that we usually become acquainted with in environments like work or school, and I felt sorry for my not being able to recognize that before.  It seemed that I could see the goodness in everyone, and how hard they tried to hide it (if they did) didnt make a difference.  I could see humanity.  My eyes, which I could now sense even without being able to see them, were black holes that could and did pierce through to the true meaning of anything.  My friend, B, asked me if I was high, and I responded to him the same as I responded to my other friends: Im not high, Im merely altered.  I told him about what I did, and he began to develop an interest in trying them.  He verified my sense that my pupils were \x91freakin huge, and this is the point when I began to veritably cling to the phrase \x85like black holes in the sky, from the Pink Floyd song Shine on You Crazy Diamond (I think Im going through a very \x91Floydian phase in my life).  Fortunately we didnt do much work in that period.  In fact, I think I spent over three-quarters of the class-time chilling and reflecting on stuff.  When the teacher was up at the front of the class I would try to avert my eyes to my desk whenever he looked in my general direction because, although I was \x91normal in the sense of the way I would act, I felt my pupils were a dead give-away that \x91somethings wrong with that kid.      He gave the class a worksheet that I seemed to finish about half an hour before everyone else did.  When I was working I had the understanding that much of the work we were doing required such basic knowledge that one didnt even need to look in the book once to complete the entire worksheet, even though almost everyone else was poring through the textbook, I felt \x91smarter, in a sense, and I think that is one of the key reasons why people can fall into a psychological hole with mind-altering drugs.  The drug will give them a sense that they are all of a sudden more knowledgeable, and that they have \x91expanded their mind.  The keywords there are \x91are and \x91have because these people dont come to the realization that they merely think they have expanded their minds.  I feel very thankful that I can realize that the mind-altering experiences of drugs are finite, and although a person may gain insights from within the experience that he/she may apply to change how that person views life forever, they are merely evanescent experiences.  I have friends who have actually tripped on acid and experienced ego death, but they have told me that their ego eventually finds its way back, no matter how permanently changed they feel.      I went to the bathroom on several occasions during the time when everyone else was working, because my bladder seemed to have an unusual amount of pressure on it.  The first time, on my way to the bathroom I suddenly had the urge to spread out my arms and pretend I was soaring through the air.  I began to experience more of these impulses as the experience progressed, and realized that it felt good to follow these impulses lest I feel repressed.  Before I did this I looked around quickly to see if there was anyone around, but there wasnt so I commenced my flight to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I was examining my eyes for the first time in what seemed a very long time.  The pupils took up the entire space of my eye but for 1/16th or 1/32nd of an inch of iris, and no matter how hard I tried to make the pupils contract in any way they simply would not, not even if I looked straight at a bright light.  They wouldve been able to expand, Im sure, if there was any more room for them to expand.  I began to notice that lights and shapes would stay imprinted on my retina for an unusually long time if I blinked, and I say \x91if I blinked because just then I also noticed that I had the tendency to leave my eyes wide open and staring.  Im pretty sure I was grinning widely the whole time, saying intermittently things like This is the best experience of my life! and Wow!  I then commenced peeing and found that despite the great pressure on my bladder not much came out, it felt gratifying nonetheless.  Again, I had an impulse, but this time it was when I saw myself reflected in the black plastic of the paper-towel dispenser.  The reflection looked akin to a funhouse mirror, and I wanted to bob up and down in front of it\x85so I did.  On the way back I resisted flying, because I became conscious of the fact that there were classrooms with windows facing inside, but I still felt like I was floating more than walking, it seemed too liquid.  Sometimes I would catch myself smiling, just because, it seemed, and I made myself stop because I thought it might look suspiciously like I was on something to see me smiling like a loon.    \tThe second trip to the bathroom was not too long after the first, but time seemed to take much longer than it actually did, that didnt matter anymore, though.  I had the same floaty feeling when I walked around, but no urge to fly.  This excursion had more of a compulsive \x91I gotta check on myself, feel to it.  In the bathroom, aside from peeing, I looked very closely into one of my pupils and I noticed that I could see a reflection of my reflection in the black pit of my eye.  It scared me at first, but then I seemed to understand that I was trying to comprehend \x91depth: depth of character, spatial depth, emotional depth, just depth.  I was fascinated by the mere idea of the infinite reflections within my eye, sort of like the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles.    Back in the classroom there was more time to relax, so I listened to Ummagumma: Live again.  I liked both Ummagumma albums normally, but I felt like this time that my appreciation of the music was magnified by my sense of understanding.  After my experience with Hawaiian Woodrose seeds I would describe certain songs on the live album, if not all of them, as schizophrenic, but especially Careful With That Axe, Eugene.  In my experience, though, I seemed capable of disassembling the schizophrenic randomness so I could appreciate every individual sound that passed into my ears, even if there were 30 contradicting sounds at once.  Again, more depth has been added.  To quote a line from Aldous Huxleys The Doors of Perception on the schizophrenic nature of psychedelics: most [users]\x85experience only the heavenly part of schizophrenia.  And although Huxley was referring to mescaline, I found this seemed appropriate in regards to any psychedelic.  No visuals as of yet.    Paranoia and Confusion  T+3:45  Class ended and I was glad it was lunchtime:  finally some time to relax and enjoy things!  Wrong\x85so wrong\x85  This is what I would refer to as my second \x91loop.  On my way to lunch I had another impulse to put my arm around my friend B, but I felt it necessary to tell him first.  He said it was OK, so I did, but only for a short while.  Later, shortly after my experience ended, I had the realization that there were certain people who I was either in synch with, or out of synch with.  In fact, looking back I would say there were only two people who I felt in synch with out of the entire school.  One of them, B, seemed closer to my world.  Oddly enough I found out later that he had tripped on mushrooms only several days ago.  A coincidence?  I think NOT!  The other one was a very good friend of mine, BF, who felt good to be around just because I was so familiar with him.  Ill talk about that later on.    Anyway, about lunchtime.  Our school has a commons for students to gather in when its time to eat, and the cacophonous sound of several hundred students talking can be pretty dang disconcerting for one who is under the spell of a psychedelic.  I felt pretty good when I was with B, but soon after I left him things started sliding downhill.  First of all, the noisy commons=not good.  Second, every person that I sat with at lunch seemed to be out of synch with me, even the good friends that I normally sit with, like S.  Third, I started to slip into the negative mind-frame that I was never going to return to my normal state of mind, and that I would still be like this by the time my mom picked me up from school (even though that was still about 3\xbd hours away).  Not to mention that whenever I told S how terrified I was starting to feel, he would reply with something completely negative and/or sarcastic, either confirming my fears or joking about them.  Most likely, he was just kidding around, thats how he usually jokes, but at the moment I could not tell at all and it was freaking me out.  I realized, then, how negative a person S really is, and how truly rare it is I ever hear something positive coming from him.  He and I are still friends, though.  At the time, however, his negativity seemed to grow into my mind.  Fourth, time had no meaning.  NO\x85FUCKING\x85MEANING!  Do you know how scary that is?!  To have something that is so regimented into our daily lives all of a sudden fly out the window is not a comfortable feeling, to say the very least.  Its not so much that I cared to know the time, but when you look at the clock, three hours pass, you look at the clock again only to find that two minutes have passed, then you look at the clock after ten minutes have gone by but in reality only one minute has passed, its\x85well, its really, really disorienting.  Fifth, my thoughts were now racing faster than I could manage, and my speech was showing it.  When I would talk to someone like S there were times when I would try to spend five seconds talking about five different subjects, which just came out as complete gibberish.  And sixth, I realized I had an assignment to complete within the next twenty minutes before English class.  Count \x91em, folks.  Thats six different things that were going wrong on a total mind trip (I still havent had any visuals yet).  I mean, Ive heard of one thing totally wrecking a trip, but this is six.  And aside from the things going wrong, I couldnt feel my body anymore if I just sat there (if I touched something or myself, I would feel it again), and I was really twitchy.  I simply couldnt stop fidgeting with something, be it rubbing my face, legs, or arms, scratching my head, running my fingers through my hair (I did that a lot, which made my hair all frizzed out), or just constantly shifting my position.  For a while I was telling S that I was seriously considering leaving school and running as fast and as far away from there as I could.  I thank any god out there that I didnt have any visual hallucinations at that time, otherwise it would have been completely out of my control.  From about 11.05a.m. to 11.45a.m. I think I was teetering on the verge of a panic attack.    All of these factors were present before I started to get truly uncomfortable, but I think they started to grow when I didnt have anything to distract myself with.  Before my mental discomfort came about, I was trying to eat my lunch.  And I say \x91trying because I dont think I was physically capable of eating food without taking hours on end.  It was like I forgot how to eat:  Id put a bite of sandwich in my mouth, chew it a bit, then it would fall out of my mouth a couple times before I could get it down my throat, it felt so weird.  Food was pretty amusing, I must admit, especially the orange I had.  I didnt want to eat it, it just made me happy to look at it.  One time, I placed my tongue on my sandwich merely so I could feel the texture, which was far more interesting than the taste or need to satisfy hunger (despite not having eaten at all throughout the day, I didnt have much of an appetite).      Everything wasnt going too well just by me sitting there, but when I realized that I had to finish my English assignment it got really bad.  First of all, I couldnt find it for a long time, partly because I would start looking for the paper I needed then forget what I was rummaging around in my backpack for, and subsequently messily shoved all the random stuff I pulled out back into my backpack.  Then, after a couple seconds, I realized that I hadnt gotten the paper I needed and I went back to rummaging around in my backpack until I remembered I put it in my English binder, like where I put all of my other English assignments.  When I finally got the assignment and put everything back in its place, I realized I forgot a marker.  So, I had to pull everything back out to get a marker.  Confused much?  When I attempted at highlighting the article I was supposed to have read, I would start out being extremely focused on the paper and highlight about four paragraphs worth of information in about four seconds.  But then, all of a sudden, I would lose all focus and sort of stare blankly at my paper for some time.  By the time I stopped spacing out, I would have forgotten what I was doing and would just be confused because there was this paper on my lap and a marker in my hand and would just then recall that I had been highlighting this article for English.  So, I would continue, and then repeat the whole befuddled process all over again.  I eventually stopped after trying to work for about fifteen minutes, because I finally figured it out that I was only making it hard on myself:  I simply was unable to work at all.    I needed to go to the bathroom again, there was still an unusual pressure on my bladder.  On my way to the bathroom I was muttering to myself the lyrics \x85like black holes in the sky, and I met my other \x91in synch friend, BF.  He said some trivial little things like \x91Look at this kid!  Youre so out of it!  And I looked at him, still feeling terrified that I would never return to my right frame of mind, that I would be mentally stuck outside of myself forever, and said, \x91I need help.  He then got a little more serious and suggested he could play his banjo.  That sounded like the best idea in the world to me at the time\x85but I had to pee first.  So I did.  Then I looked at myself in the mirror.  As terrified as I felt, looking in the mirror calmed me somehow, just as it had before when I felt sick.  I looked cracked out, though:  my hair was all frazzled, my eyes were wide and staring (but not bloodshot at all), my skin had a red, flushed color like I had a fever, and, to top it all off, I was wearing a tie-dye shirt.  I saw myself in the black, plastic paper-towel dispenser again, and that cheered me up some.  Hearing my friend plunking on his banjo stilled my mind like no other, and I needed it.  I didnt care if he had only been playing banjo since that morning (which is true) and wasnt very good yet.  It was music, and that was what I needed the most.  I tell him my thoughts about running off, and he agrees that thats what he would be thinking too, but not to do it.  I consented.  Seeing him really brought some of my sanity back.  Also, getting away from the loud commons room was a good thing.  He said that it was time to go to class, so we went our separate ways.    I head to English class, totally freaking out about the assignment I didnt do.  Walking into class, I kept my head lowered for the most part because I was completely paranoid that anyone who would see my eyes would know that I was tripping hardcore:  they were still terrified, unblinking, and dilated to the max.  I took my seat, mostly keeping my eyes downcast, but every now and again casting furtive glances around me to see if people were staring.  Class began, the teacher went in front of the class and began explaining about something which I could completely not understand:  I was on a totally different mental plane.  Still keeping my eyes on my desk and open binder (to make it look like I knew what I was doing), I saw the color yellow which, for some reason, made me think I was back in sixth grade and felt guilty for not doing an assignment I easily could have completed.  The part about the assignment was true at the time, but somehow the color yellow took me back to another time in my life.  The air I was breathing felt like a soothing liquid entering my lungs.  I became even more confused when I looked up to see I was still in tenth grade English class, and my teacher was still talking nonsense (for all I was concerned).    Salvation  T+3:55  Then, through my desire to get the hell out of school, I devised a brilliant idea:  I would excuse myself as feeling sick, have my drug-un-savvy dad pick me up from school, fake-sick my way through the drive home, then do what I please (though so as not to arouse parental suspicion) once I get home.  GENIUS!  I got up while my teacher was busy babbling away and approached the student teacher.  Step 1:  put on sickly face (not hard in my state of mind), Step 2:  Uhh\x85Im..not\x85feeling too well\x85I need to call home\x85, Step 3:  call home, make sure to sound sick and explain the symptoms (yes, nausea and stomach ache sounds wonderful\x85), Step 4:  excuse self from class, receiving all-powerful Green Slip from teacher, Step 5:  leave class and wander aimlessly until dad comes, brandish Green Slip like it was your towel (always know where your towel is\x85).    So I left very shortly after class started, in said fashion, and wandered around with said Almighty Green Slip (I could pretty much go anywhere with that thing).  I eventually made my way to yet another bathroom (our school has four, not including locker-rooms).  I looked in the mirror and felt relieved, yet still entirely out of place in my understanding of everyday life, but, I had it all together.  I took a deep breath of satisfaction, and my tie-dye shirt breathed with me.  *Gasp*!  My first visual!  No, it was not merely because of my chest rising and falling (in reality that probably was the case:  my state of mind just distorted it), but rather that the shirt drew breath on its own accord although in unison with my breath.  I continued to breathe deeply and watch my shirt breathe, when I noticed that all of my surroundings had subtly begun to respire as well.  Breathe in, everything expands.  Breathe out, everything softly returns to normal.    Leaving the bathroom, I enjoyed this new aspect of my trip when, on my way to wait in the library, I met B again!  How marvelous!  I spoke with him, still quite capable of speaking (although in a clearly altered fashion), and told him of all the wonderful things that were happening to me, trying to describe the breathing and\x85now the walls were moving!  Oh joy!  The walls are moving!  Since I have gotten in trouble (pot-related, comes long after this experience), I have related things that I have seen in my psychedelic experiences to my mom, and she feels that she would not be able to handle things like objects breathing and walls shifting shapes.  On the contrary, it brought me great joy to embrace anything out of the ordinary, as has been the case with my ingestion of all psychoactive substances.  Hell, Ive even found that embracing the paranoia that comes with marijuana actually settles me down and helps make me feel less paranoid:  in general, running from things that come up during altered states of mind usually will make that thing worse.  The only way to deal with it is to go with the flow.    By the way, as soon as I got out of class I put on my headphones and tuned in to Pink Floyds Ummagumma:  Studio album.  One might think, Hm.  Sounds like thatd be rather \x91unsettling, to say the least.  Not so.  While Ummagumma:  Studio is quite disturbing and twisted in more than one way, I experienced it all together, taking the pleasant with the unsettling as part of the whole journey.    In the library, as I sat quietly at an empty table with my head resting on my arms, watching the room breathe around me, I began prepping myself on how I would enter my dads car without appearing totally out of it.  Part of this process included making sure I could fake sickness:  I would think to myself (in practice), *groan* I feel sick\x85  Although I convinced myself thoroughly that I could, indeed, appear convincingly sick, doing this made me start thinking that I actually was sick.  I immediately dismissed that idea, but somehow it continued to linger for awhile as a shadow of doubt:  Am I really alright?    I had started ignoring time altogether, for I knew that if I didnt my seemingly steadying world would stop pretending to make sense.  Nevertheless, I kept an eye on the clock to be certain time didnt trick me and make me miss my ride out of there (cant trust time\x85after all, its not on your side).    My dad finally arrived and I felt so relieved yet freaked out at the same time.  I was gettin the hell out of Dodge.    On the Road Again  T+4:50  The ride home turned out to be much less taxing than I had imagined it would be:  I kept my eyes downcast getting into the car, and, once inside, immediately assumed a position that clearly said I have a bad stomach ache, in hopes my dad wouldnt bug me much.  It worked perfectly.  We exchanged a few customary words, which was rather easy for me in spite of my twisted mind.  Even though talking didnt seem to be a problem, once the car got moving, and I lifted my eyes to look out the window, it became difficult for me to conceal my Im-Tripping-and-Loving-It face with my Ugh-Im-So-Sick face, on multiple occasions did I find myself having to wipe a loony, open-mouthed grin off (and hope to god my dad didnt see it\x85).    In the outside world, things were sooo much better than inside a dingy, oppressing school.  Trees were dancing (it was rather windy out), the lines on the road were a-zipping on by\x85and I was going home!  I experienced a strange, yet not too disquieting, sensation while the car was moving.  I kept thinking, What a strange concept, these hulking chunks of tin-foil and gears that we have grown so accustomed to controlling with odd pedals and steering devices.  I decided to take a chance and voice this idea to my dad, he agreed, yes, it was a strange idea.  We held a small, yet satisfying, conversation about the marvels of human advancement in technologies and evolution.  It was so satisfying because it made me feel less isolated in my state of mind.    Ahhhh\x85\x85  T+5:15  We get home and my dad recommends that I head up to my room and rest for a bit.  Even though what I really wanted to do was to put some good music into my walkman and take a trek through nature, I said that sounded like a good idea.  Honestly, it wasnt nearly as bad as being stuck in school.    In my room, I crawled under my comforter, sweatshirt, jeans and all, put a lavender-scented eye-pillow over my eyes, and finished listening to Ummagumma:  Studio.  Without going into too much detail, this part of my trip felt very internalizing, and the music seemed to take me different places in my mind.  Every now and then I would peek out from under the eye-pillow at my slightly cracked door to make sure my dad hadnt snuck into my room and was staring at me, wondering why his son was in bed with all his clothes on, a nightshade on his face, and listening to music.  Lights and images would stay imprinted on my retina longer, due to my still much dilated pupils.  During this time I also re-experienced the whole minutes/hours/days? thing.  I proceeded to listen to Ummagumma:  Live again, and then Dark Side of the Moon until about 2.45-3pm.  Dark Side didnt actually feel like the choicest music to listen to in my state of mind:  I likened it more to music for getting stoned rather than a philosophical state of trippage.  If I held really still and focused on the music, it felt like my aura (?) was levitating about two feet above my body.  Very mild kaleidoscopic CEV, and patterns in the music were always in loops, even when the pattern changed it was still all part of the same loop.  It was good music for the comedown, though, as I was definitely coming down at this point and felt like my mind just wanted to drift, I had probably been slowly but surely coming down since I had gotten home at around 1.00pm.  The comedown was very gradual, which made the transition back to reality easier.    Stupid is as stupid does\x85  T+8:00  Before and during Dark Side, I got a sign that reality was creeping back in:  I became aware of my body once again, by noticing the feel of my lips, and how freakin hot and sweaty I was.  I took off my pants and sweatshirt.  Yeah\x85I was pretty damn sweaty.  It felt like I had a fever, but not in an uncomfortable way.    When the album was over at around 3.00pm, I got out of bed.  Reality was very real, but it took me quite some time to adjust to ordinary stuff.  I felt very estranged from everyday activities like putting pants on, or drinking water, and would sometimes get a little confused in the midst of doing said activities.  Checking in the bathroom mirror, my pupils were still rather dilated, but my iris had begun regaining ground.  I felt confident enough to confront my parents, provided I kept the whole Im sick\x85 routine up.    I went downstairs, feeling very drained mentally and physically, and yet I somehow felt accomplished.  Sitting down on the living room sofa, my body (although I was regaining my physical senses) felt rather numb.  When I conversed with my parents, I imagine my talking sounded rather normal but slightly on the tired/sick side.  I was golden.    I fix a Cup-o-Noodles, as per my mothers loving suggestion, and head upstairs to watch a movie and take my tired mind off things.  The concept of fork/noodles/Styrofoam cup seemed alien to me (after all, it really is\x85weve just gotten used to it, consensus reality, anyone?), but I didnt belabor the thought.  I knew right away which movie I was going to watch:  Forrest Gump.  I really feel like I cant explain how that movie felt so right, but it just did.  In a sense, I sort of felt like Forrest:  a person with an apparently dim perception of consensus reality, yet perhaps with greater insight into life than any of the normal people.  A brilliant movie.    Gauging by the size of my pupils and my estrangement to reality, I figure I fully came down from the experience at around 5.45pm, a good ten hours after eating the seeds.  Of course there were still some lingering effects, most pronounced that evening and much less so the following days.    In the Real World  After Effects    Since this experience, I have taken another dose of 6 seeds about three weeks after (the tea method was a dud, by the way\x85) and eaten 4.5g of Morning Glory seeds (an experience soon to be added to its respective vault).  Both were worthwhile experiences, though not the most pleasant, but I wont go into that so much.    For several months (usually ~2) after an experience, I find that certain things will trigger a mild flashback of sorts.  The flashbacks arent mental at all, but purely visual.  Oddly enough, the visuals I have experienced in flashbacks are often more intense than the visuals from the actual experience.  Say, for example, I just finish jogging (a surefire way to precipitate residual effects within that two month timeframe):  I walk down the driveway, and pause on the apron to just look around, objects and the ground are vividly rippling, especially if I space out at one spot for any length of time.  This usually lasts for only several minutes.    On more than one occasion the color orange has triggered some response.  I was reading a magazine and I saw a vibrant orange in an advertisement.  I looked up, not feeling particularly strange at all, and notice that objects (mostly the furniture) seemed to be levitating several centimeters off the ground.  This, too, lasts only a minute or so.    Sometimes when in the car, whether driving or not, I will get a strange sensation of having whats in my vision stretch out, then suddenly click back to normal, only to start stretching out again.  I can liken the sensation only to the effect from the Lord of the Rings movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, where Frodo and Sam have just run into Merry and Pippin and the latter three are avidly collecting mushrooms on the road (stay off the main path\x85), Frodo looks down the road, seems to get a queer sensation, and then the road starts to stretch out in a disquieting fashion.  The only difference with what happens in my vision is that the sensation is recurring.  This lasts a very finite amount of time, usually a minute or less.    All in all, the aftereffects, while notably there, do not seem debilitating in any way and are all but gone within three months.  I can carry out ordinary, even complex tasks with no trouble at all.    Many people report nausea with the ingestion of such entheogens as H.B. woodrose and Morning Glory seeds.  Personally, the worst nausea Ive had came with my first time taking H.B. woodrose, and it seemed to be less pronounced with each experience.  I have never vomited the stuff up, during or after the experience, I have had strange bowel movements the day after, though.  Along with slight nausea and stomach discomfort, I have also experienced slight cramps or pains in my hamstrings, congested sinuses, and a funny spinal sensation (with Morning Glories).    I cannot stress how important I feel it is to start at a much lower dose than you think you need, and, in the case of these seeds, how much of a difference one little seed can make, the difference between a 4 seed experience and a 6 seed experience is immense.  Good stuff, though.  And, besides, its legal.      Happy trails,  Mithrandir"
21691,Meat-Locker Experience,Dr. gonzo,"Sep 24, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"This experience occurred this last fall, but I suppose that I will never forget it. I have had experience with several psychedelics over the last few years, including lsd, psyllocibin, and mescaline. Out of these, I would have to admit that lsd is by far my favorite because of the hallucinations, both audial and visual. The mind trip is also wonderful, with its ability to wisk me away to several places in one sitting. But I soon realized that these woodrose seeds have the ability to take me to places that I shouldn\'t go.    Being at my own home, I followed the recipe for preparation that is given in Lance Stafford\'s \'Psychedelic\'s Encyclopedia\', which recommended grinding the seeds down to a powder, mixing them in water, then straining through a cheesecloth or coffee filter. As the book says, the amides of value are in this liquid. My horticulturist friend who actually grew the plants that these seeds came from gave me the same advice. He had recommended that I start with about six seeds for a good solid experience. I did this my first time and received effects similar to that of a small psylocibin high. Very minimal visual disturbances, along with obvious mind trickery.    I waited a few days before trying it again, as I learned a long time ago that doubling up on any mind altering drug two days in a row. So when the time was right again, I made a mixture containing 12 seeds and downed it promptly. This time, I started experiencing wave-like sensations that were very lsd-like. For instance, while relaxing on my bed, I could visually see the bed ripple like water and actually feel my body doing the same thing. This was rather neat, and it compelled me to listen to music. I grabbed my headphones and began listening to the Beatles\' magic mystery tour. This is cool, because in the opening title track they say \'The mystery trip\' several times in the background. I fell into the music, and began to just float away without any real comprehension of my room around me. Somewhere in the fifth track, I fell into what can only be described as a conscious dream. The only thing was my complete belief that I was awake and in this dream. It felt more real than reality, in short.    Except what followed was not at all like any reality I have ever been apart of, at least that I recall. If you have ever watched Jacob\'s ladder, you can start understanding that what I was experiencing was a strange twist on my day to day life. With every additional step forward, I fell further and further from a recognizable description of life. I will begin explaining this in detail. It was as if I was at a normal day of work, although work did not resemble work. Everything was somewhat different, yet seemingly the same. As time, actually time in hours into days, expired, I began feeding on some strange primordial urge to take out my anger. This manifested itself when I had an encounter with a person who I actually had had problems with in reality. I killed him and his girlfriend. Actually, I don\'t think you could use the term \'killed\' because it was much worse than that. It was more like total and absolute destruction. I tore their limbs from their bodies. It was very, very grotesque. From this point, it only became worse. Substantially.    Everyone that became a witness or I felt was in my way died. People that I really do know and care for in reality became a dismembered number. I actually had to enlist the help of a friend who, for some strange reason, was more than happy to help. He took joy in the murders; I only killed out of despair and fear. Finally, I came to the point that I had decided that there was no way out. Pure meat-locker shit. But, suddenly, I realized that I was actually still sitting on my bed at virtually the same moment as when the \'dream\' began! A pure moment of eternity! I fell into shivers and a cold sweat, because for a time I still was not convinced that I hadn\'t killed those people. It took me a while to come back to a decent mental condition; I actually was glad that I was by myself.    After this, I decided that I would not experiment with the woodrose, at least for quite some time. Actually, I have only dosed with mushrooms once or twice since. These experiences were much more positive than much of the ones that I have been through before, so I have theorized that this experience strengthened my inner constitution far beyond my previous disposition. I do realize that everything I experienced was a result of my hidden demons and deep seated fear and hatred. I feel that I expunged these feelings in the most safe and productive way that can be done. This has given me a new-found respect for psychedelics in general."
48034,Overwhelming,John,"Sep 23, 2007","H. B. Woodrose, Meclinzine, Caffeine & Ephedrine","This report got a bit long winded, so to sum things up I took a bunch of Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds and had the most intense trip of my life. I\'ve never done acid before, so I can only compare my experience to shrooms, and salvia I guess, but that is pretty different. Without question this blew the shrooms out of the water in every way. Utterly mind shattering. If anyone has the intention of trying the seeds I urge them to be careful as they are pretty unpredictable. I had previously tried sublingual absorption of 9 HBWR seeds (probably an Indian strain) that I bought from a regular gardening store. They had no effect. Next I tried sublingual absorption of 5 HBWR seeds bought from an ethnobotanical store that were the Hawaiian strain. Again no effect. This time I took 10 of those seeds sublingually, in addition ingesting about a quarter of them, and for seven hours they tossed my salad in ways I can\'t even begin to describe. The trip started out very bad, enough to be dangerous, so again, be careful. I snapped out of the bad period relatively quickly however.    Now here\'s the full report.    T+00:00 (9:00pm) 10 HBWR seeds sublingually, about 2.5 ingested    Around 9:00pm I took two dramamine \'less drowsy formula\' (meclizine hcl 50mg) in an effort to prevent nausea. I also took 200mg caffeine and 37.5mg ephedrine to combat drowsiness. The ephedrine capsules also had guaifenesin since they were sold as asthema medication.    At that point I ground up 10 Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds with a mortar and pestle. These were purchased from a reputable online retailer of ethnobotanicals, where they were advertised as organic and being of the Hawaiian strain. The seeds did not have the fuzzy coating, however.    I placed the ground up seeds under my tongue. I swished the seeds around in my mouth for about 15 minutes in an attempt to achieve the nausea-avoiding sublingual absorption others have described. I intended to keep them in there longer, but at that point my friends came to pick me up to go out for the night so I reluctantly spat the saliva/seed soup out of my mouth and into a cup. Worried that I had not kept the seeds in my mouth long enough, I then drank about a quarter of the contents of the cup.    T+01:00 (10:00pm) body load    As I was riding in my friend\'s car, I began to feel a bit of nausea. We got to a bar where we hung out with a large group of people. For the next hour and a half or so, I felt pretty awful. In addition to nausea, I felt lightheaded, weak, dizzy, tired, and just generally sick. At this point I wanted to go home and lie down, but I didn\'t want to stop socializing. So I did my best to stick it out. A couple times the nausea caused me to vomit, but for the most part I just dry heaved. With the help of some more alcohol, which I had been ingesting throughout the evening, I was eventually able to vomit more productively, much to my relief. By about 11:30 or so the body load was much better, and by midnight it was completely gone. Keep in mind that up until now I had experienced nothing psychedelic or in any way interesting.    T+03:30 (12:30pm) trip begins with emotional breakdown    As far as I could tell at this point, the seeds had done nothing but make me sick, and I had all but forgotten about the possibility of tripping. Then the trip started, and it started out bad. Bad enough to be dangerous. But only because I was unprepared and didn\'t realize I was tripping at first.    Around midnight my friends and I headed over to a club. After arriving at the club I began to get increasingly depressed. I had had some mildly depressing thoughts that afternoon, and I began to dwell on them. I grew more and more irrationally sad. This culminated in me having a 30 minute nervous breakdown in a bathroom stall. I was utterly despondent. I stood in the stall, unable to leave, clawing at the wall as I was gripped by uncontrollable suicidal thoughts and panic.    At this point, I had no idea the LSA was influencing me. I had not yet experienced anything psychedelic and was completely clear headed. If you had talked to me, I would have been totally articulate and probably would have seemed sober as a judge. Just suicidal.    Eventually, I managed to convince myself that maybe I was starting to trip and the breakdown I had just had was the result of the seeds I had taken. A quick look in the mirror revealed that my eyes were dilated. In fact my pupils were so large I could barely see my irises (i.e., the colored rings). I wandered out of the bathroom, emotionally broken and shaken.    T+04:00 (1:00am) indescribable euphoria    In the course of just a few minutes, I began to feel much better. I became convinced that the seeds were in fact making me irrational, and felt better and better about it. These feelings of happiness grew to unbelievable proportions.    Probably only 15 minutes after wanting to kill myself in the bathroom stall, I was lost in the throes of the most indescribable euphoria I have ever experienced. Every cell in my body was overflowing with the most boundless love and joy. I was still completely clear headed (I had also stopped drinking a while back), articulate, and logical. I realized that I was only feeling this way because I was tripping, and I didn\'t care. I didn\'t care about anything. I smiled and laughed and danced. I was at a club so this did not seem out of the ordinary. I wanted to tell everyone how much love I had for them. This continued in full force for about an hour, and to a much lesser extent throughout the rest of the trip.    I was still not experiencing the traditional psychedelic effects (closed eye visuals, inanimate objects seeming alive, etc.) to any significant degree, but I was definitely way out of my mind. There is really no way to describe the euphoria I experienced. It was deeper, richer, and a thousand times more intense than any good feeling I have ever had, either sober or on any drug I have used. It would not be hyperbole to say that I experienced more total happiness in this period of about an hour than I had experienced in my entire life up until that point. And it was wild, relentless, out of control, and overwhelming.    T+06:00 (3:00am) exhausting psychedelic frenzy    Around 2:30am my friend had given me a ride home (he was sober at the time). For a while I just sat in my room listening to music and enjoying more euphoria. I laid back on my bed and just let waves of happiness crash over me. At this point I was getting really tired. As much as I wanted to continue the trip, I felt I was just too tired and decided to try to go to sleep.    I think turning out the lights and closing my eyes was what triggered the psychedelic wildness that began at that point. It didn\'t take long to realize sleep was out of the question. I was feeling very speedy; I was excited out of mind and the world was going nuts around me. The lights came back on, and for the next three or four hours I paced around my apartment tripping balls. I experienced everything I have previously experienced on shrooms and, on top of that, everything I have ever heard anyone say about acid. The walls were breathing, inanimate objects seemed alive, and the room at times seemed full of people and devilish apparitions of all sorts. Closing my eyes resulted in utterly overwhelming visuals. Whirling, racing two dimensional geometric patterns, crazy cartoonish visions, and occasional strange three dimensional scenes. All at a million miles an hour. At one point I stood in my bathroom and just stared at my body in the mirror. Right before my eyes I was changing size and shape.    These sorts of things went on for hours, and it was overwhelming and completely exhausting. I was too tired and spent to take any more, and many times I tried to just relax and go to sleep. I wasn\'t having a bad time or at all afraid, I was just really, really mentally and physically exhausted. It actually would have been a lot of fun had I not been so worn out.    All this time I was completely rational and clear headed. No one else was around, but it would have been easy for me to carry on a conversation and appear completely normal, although maybe a little tired and frazzled. Previously when I have done shrooms I felt dreamy and stoned in addition to all the psychedelic effects, but throughout this entire trip I never felt drugged in that sense.    I checked my pupils several times and they remained very dilated.    T+10:00 (7:00am) sleep    Finally I got to sleep; I believe it was around 7:00am. I only slept for about two hours, but when I woke up the trip was completely over. I was back to baseline, but very shaken up. My pupils were also back to normal.    In retrospect the actual psychedelic stuff I experienced was the least significant part of the trip. The emotional roller coaster of the initial nervous breakdown and following unbelievable euphoria made all the closed eye visuals and breathing walls and so forth seem like cheap parlor tricks. The experience of being suicidal then more happy then you ever could have previously imagined all in the course of a couple hours really rattles the foundations of your sanity. It was a life changing experience. Which is a very scary thing to say, and I\'m reluctant to say it.    One thing I really haven\'t been able to describe throughout this report is the series of mind games I experienced. For seven hours my consciousness was tossed around like a rag doll in ways I can\'t relate. Anyone that would consider this recreational must have balls the size of Manhattan. Terms like \'ego-shattering\' and \'mind-bending\' have taken on a completely new meaning for me.    Overall, this was way, way too much. I\'m never going to (intentionally) take this much of any psychedelic drug ever again. And I probably won\'t touch any at all for quite some time. Don\'t get me wrong, the experience was much more good than it was bad, it was just too much of everything."
43478,"Great Move, Katya",Nikolai,"Sep 15, 2007",H. B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"One day in February 2005, a friend of mine, who we shall call Ivan, told me about Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.  He said that they contain lysergic acid amide, a chemical related closely to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).  Ivan had ordered a package of these seeds from the internet, but he was unable to take them at the time, so he asked if I would try them out for him.  Who could turn down a free trip?  Not I.    So, I met him at his apartment on a chilly February evening.  When I arrived, we put on some techno music that he had mixed, and I took eight seeds (around 10:00 PM).  He left me for a little while to meditate and do as I please.  Ivan told me that there would likely be some nausea involved, so I smoked a bowl or two of the marijuana I brought along to combat any nausea.  After attaining a rather pleasant high from the Mary Jane, I sat on Ivan\'s couch and waited, and meditated, and waited some more.    After about 20 minutes, I began to feel the physical-inertia effects typical of my former experiences with psilocybic mushrooms.  I was feelin\' good.  I got up to tell Ivan, who was in his makeshift techno mixing studio working his magic with the music.  I leaned on the door frame and told him it was working; I described to him with the amazing coherency of a sober person how the room was gently waving.  20 minutes is usually how long it takes for a mushroom trip to hit me, and thinking that it wasn\'t going to get much better than the smooth, light experience I was having at the moment, I ate two more seeds.    We decided that we needed some nitrous oxide, so we went to the grocery store around the corner to buy a can of whipped cream.  I started to trip here - the worst possible place to be tripping on lysergic acid.  When we were in the store, there were many people around, and I could feel that some of them knew something was wrong with me, especially the worker packing dairy products I stared intently at while waiting for Ivan to get out of the bathroom.  Waiting in line was very awkward, so I went outside and waited for Ivan to buy the whipped cream.  It seemed like hours!  Getting coffee afterwards wasn\'t much better because of all the people, but the walk back was very cool, with plenty of tactile and auditory hallucinations, unfortunately along with a bit of paranoia.    But I hadn\'t reached the top yet; it was when we arrived back at his apartment that I REALLY tripped balls.  Ivan turned off all the lights and plugged in his black light.  The techno music was playing, and I felt great.  I peaked as we sat drawing with a neon-green HiLite pen, about two hours after I took the seeds, about 11:45 PM or midnight, I saw an beautiful blue teardrop-shaped streak momentarily take over most of my field of vision, and I felt as if I were ascending up to heaven.  I was feeling great!  The black light and glowing green pen were very psychadellic, the blaring techno music seemed to become a part of my existence, and I was comfortable in Ivan\'s slummy but familiar apartment and his caring presence.      My trip was completely ruined sometime soon after its peak, meaning that I was still way up there trippin\' hard.  There was a knock on the door, so I got up to get it.  I stared intently at the smiling woman at the door (with huge, dilated eyes).  At first, I thought she was a neighbor who wanted us to turn down the music, but it was actually Ivan\'s girlriend, who we\'ll call Katarina.  Katarina smelled of booze and told us that she threw up twice.  Great move, Katya.    Simply hearing that had a huge psychosomatic effect on me; I immediately felt sick, rushed to the bathroom, and dry heaved.  All sorts of horrible, terrible thoughts came to my head.  I convinced myself that I was going to die.  I imagined drowning myself in his toilet or shooting myself through the back of my head.  I would never see my family or friends again, and my employers were going to find out and fire me (yes, after I was dead).  Intense memories flashed before me; my throat felt like it was closing up, and I definitely thought I was going to die.    In my state of intense trippage, I thought it would be a good idea to call my parents to pick me up and rescue me from this horrible trip, so I asked him to call for me.  After understanding that this would not be a wise idea, I asked him to call my girlfriend instead.  I gave him a number off the top of my head, which really belonged to a store, three times.  I also began talking to him in a language of unintelligeable gibberish.    To make the rest of the night\'s long story short, we finally called my girlfriend, and the drive home to our apartment on the other side of town was a roller coaster ride from hell.  After arriving home, I felt that I needed to puke out the bad thoughts, but nothing wanted to come out.  I tried to lay down, but it was as if my motor neurons were snapping with electricity.  I flailed about the floor for a long time until I wore myself out.  But I still couldn\'t sleep, and couldn\'t puke.  I finally fell asleep around 6:00 or 7:00 AM that morning.  For the next three days, I recuperated, trying to deal with the inability to focus my thoughts and generally feeling like crap.    Next time, I\'ll take a smaller dose."
50127,Mixed Feelings,Desecration,"Sep 5, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first time on HBW, and one of the greatest and most awful drug related experiences of my life, all rolled into one. I had researched HBW quite extensively before tripping and had asked a couple of friends who had done around 10 seeds before what to expect, so I felt quite well prepared. Unfortunately, it turned out I wasnt all that prepared at all.    I had a few friends around, and two decided to trip with me. We all agreed on doing 10 seeds each and went about preparing them by heating them in the microwave in a mug of water for a minute per 10 seeds in an attempt to soften them. After heating them we began to chew the 10 seeds thoroughly until they were completely broken down, then swallowed. We each also took a vitamin C tablet, as Id heard this heightens the visuals. My two friends also drank down the water the seeds had been heated in; I was going to as well, but decided against it due to the foul taste.    After about 20 minutes both my friends began to complain of nausea and felt as if theyd be sick quite soon. They both headed up to the bathroom and prepared themselves for what was coming, one leaning over the sink and the other leaning over the bathtub. After about 10 minutes of waiting, they both began to vomit quite heavily. By this time I myself was feeling the effects, although I wasnt nearly as nauseas as my friends. I was feeling quite uncomfortable, fairly nauseas and how I would feel if I were extremely stoned. I decided to go take a lay down on my bed, and thankfully this eased the discomfort, but only very slightly.    After around an hour or so of intermittent vomiting, one of my friends felt quite fed up and, against my best advice, decided to get a taxi home. By this time I was still feeling as I had when Id started to feel the effects, although obviously they were quite a lot stronger now. After seeing my friend off and making sure he got into the taxi ok, I went back upstairs to check on my other friend. He was still in the bathroom and still felt rather unwell, although the vomiting was becoming less frequent. Between vomiting, he would just lay very still on the bathroom floor, a lot of the time too exhausted to respond well to my friend or myself.    After around an hour and a half I began to notice that lights had become quite a lot brighter and that my vision was getting slightly distorted  as Id expect on an MDMA experience. My mood was heightened and I was acting very giggly and happy, even though I was still in a fair bit of discomfort. I was also feeling very unbalanced and tipsy, but quite enjoying it.    After spending a while with my friend I decided to go back to my room and lay down again, this time in darkness. I also remembered a small flashing starfish toy, the kind Id expect to see at a club or rave, and decided to put it in front of my eyes. This induced some very nice, but minor visuals which I found quite captivating. I was seeing colourful chequered squares that seemed to stretch out, flashing with the light. After watching the visuals for a while, I decided that my friend HAD to see for himself, and, with great difficulty, got up and went next door to the bathroom. He was still on the bathroom floor, but the vomiting had become rather infrequent now, so I tried to convince him to muster up the energy to get up and come with me into the bedroom to watch the visuals using the flashing starfish. He was very tired, so it took me quite a while to get him to come with me, but when he did, he too was amazed with the visuals. We were both experiencing heightened moods now and felt quite happy, again, in spite of the discomfort and nausea which was still present. We also both began to see some very cool, colourful geometric patterns.    After a while of being laid on the bed watching visuals, we decided to go downstairs and wait for another friend to arrive. My friend and I decided to take a walk up to the top of the small street we were on to meet her, but upon going outside, he began to feel quite sick again and vomited just a few meters from the house. He told me to go on and meet her alone whilst he was being sick, so I left him and headed up to meet her. I remember feeling very unbalanced and tipsy when walking with her back down to the house; it was becoming quite difficult to walk.    From returning to my house and up to the end of the night, time is very disjointed and Im not really 100% sure of the order in which events occurred, although I can remember everything that happened very well. I would guess that it had been maybe two and a half to three hours by now, and the trip was really intensifying. My vision was very distorted and the edge of everything I looked at, especially things with a shiny/reflective surface, had a distorted rainbowy effect going off of it. My friend laid on the couch and I laid on the floor beside him, now practically unable to move due to the crippling exhaustion we were both experiencing. As time went on, the discomfort, visual distortion and visuals became more and more intense, although the nausea seemed to stay at the same level (thankfully, as it was quite unpleasant).    As I was laid there, I remember thinking to myself that the visuals were amazing but the discomfort was just far too heavy and that I wished it would come to an end quite soon. I think not too long after laying down my friend whod gone home in a taxi to try and sleep it off texted me. The typing was awful and a lot of it I could barely make out. To quote the text, he was \x91hallucinashitup  I found that very amusing, but I was extremely relieved to hear he was ok.    Not much later on I heard a loud bang at the back door, which made me feel severely paranoid until I discovered it was just another friend with his girlfriend, who Id invited round earlier that day. For some reason when I heard the knock, I didnt think it could have been them, thats substance induced paranoia for ya. After calming down and realizing it was just a couple of friends I began to feel ok again, but still very uncomfortable and quite nausea.    I think maybe three and a half to four hours had passed, although as I say, time was very disjointed, I cant be sure, when a friend suggested putting on the TV. One of them (Im not sure who) decided to stick on a Red Hot Chilli Peppers live DVD that I had laying around. I decided to turn around and watch for a while as the music sounded really good in that state. The vocals for example seemed to have more emotion in them than Id ever before heard, I was completely amazed by it. When I turned to look at the TV screen, I saw something that topped even that. It was the single most amazing thing of the trip. Everything looked \x91neony and the edge of the TV screen seemed to swirl and have a wave-like quality, with the picture around the edges fading very slowly away. I couldnt get over how amazing it was, and kept saying so to my friend, who also saw what I was seeing.    After a while, another friend stuck a different DVD, Shrek 2 this time. Again, the picture looked really messed up (in a very good way of course) and the voices again seemed to have so much more emotion in them, almost as if it were being over-acted. I cant remember if someone turned it off or I just got bored, but I turned away from the TV and laid back in the same position as Id been in before watching it. Shortly after this, I began to notice that my depth perception had been completely messed up, another thing that I enjoyed. I remember looking up at a friend who was sat on the couch next to me and she looked huge, like she was towering over me as if she were a mountain. I also remember looking at the light fitting above me and it seemed very close, it also looked weirdly like a face to me. I found that fascinating.    I think it was shortly after this that all of a sudden my stomach turned and I began to feel as if Id be sick very soon. I quickly jumped up and ran into the kitchen as quickly as I could, leaned over the sink and began to vomit. I was sick maybe three or four times and then physically felt quite a lot better. For some reason though, the vomiting sent me on a very bad trip, the worst Ive ever experienced, and Im no stranger to any kind of drug.    Feeling quite down, I decided to go to the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror to see how I was. Whilst up there, I just became more and more depressed  the most Ive ever been in my life. I began to dwell on problems that werent even that great, such as college and what Id do with my life. I became worried that Id fail and eventually felt as if I would, without a doubt. I became worried about my future. I felt at this point I was ruining my life with my drug use, although in truth its merely recreational. Then the worst thing of all happened to me. I began to think about life, about how when I die theres just nothing at all, as I dont really believe in an afterlife. I began to dwell on this a great deal and was still thinking about it when I went back downstairs. By this time I wasnt really noticing any visuals, although my depth perception was still messed up.    As I was sat on the couch, all I could think about was how theres nothing to life, that I\'ll just die and thats all there is to it. I felt so depressed, I honestly cant describe how bad I felt. What made it worse was that I thought the LSA had triggered some kind of manic depression, I thought that Id feel like that for the rest of my life. As I sat there I felt more alone than Id ever felt in my life, I was worried that after Id come down Id still feel the same, in fact, I was convinced I would. I began to think that if I did, the only solution would be to commit suicide, after all, how could I live like that? I couldnt. I thought about what Id say and do before I killed myself and other depressing crap.    I could tell my friends had noticed that Id become extremely quiet and still as they kept asking if I was ok, I just said I was really tired, but fine. What good would it do to tell them how I felt? In truth, I just wanted to cry though. After a while I decided to go to bed, still very much dwelling on all the negative things Id been thinking about before. Although I was still extremely depressed, I found I was extremely comfortable in bed, and my mood seemed to recover slightly. I actually felt slightly content there.    The next day I had quite a bad headache and still felt quite down, but not nearly as bad as I had the night before.    Overall, it was a very mixed experience. Through the trip I was both amazed beyond belief and depressed beyond measure. Im very glad that what happened did happen, and if I could, I wouldnt change a thing. I very much belief any experience is worth having as long as youre fine afterwards. Im not sure if Id ever do 10 seeds again. Id definitely be extremely apprehensive about it if ever I did. Oh, and to add to the report, I also later discovered that my friend whod tripped with me also became very, very depressed towards the end of his trip.    Ive since done HBW another two times, but both times Ive only done 4 seeds. Ive found this extremely fun and have experienced an amazing sense of euphoria both times, but with very minor visuals. Id definitely recommend HBW, especially in a smaller dosage of around 4 seeds. If you want to try a higher dose like I did my first time, I wouldnt say dont, but be very prepared for what my friends and I experienced."
52739,Mind-Bending in the Park,The Gardener,"Sep 4, 2007","Dionysos Capsules (Morning glory, Guarana & H.B. Woodrose) Cannabis, Damiana & Tarragon","I am 33, weighing 78kg, or 160lbs.  Dose: oral (capsules branded as Dionysos); packets only reference to dosage was \x91mix of herbs 2200mg\x91)  Regular medication - SSRI antidepressant Celexa, 20mg per morning  Had drunk approx 10 cups of strong tea and coffee in the 9 hours before consumption, SSRI taken 8 hours beforehand    I have no previous experience of hallucinogens, having used only generic weed from a local source and one weak ecstasy tablet, which had little effect other than a good night\x91s sleep and feeling buzzy the next day.     I bought 10 gelatine-encased tablets from an onliner retailer for \xa310 sterling (/about$16US at time of writing), which contained morning glory (ipomoea convulvulaceae), baby woodrose (argyria nervosa) and guarana (paulliana cupana). Little information was provided by the Dutch supplier other than this.    My friend who I often smoke with was not around so I had no sitter, which I regret because I would have liked to have chatted about the experience. The instructions said to take three or four, half an hour before the trip, avoiding drink and smoke, and to chill in a darkened room with candles. However I swallowed two capsules with only a bit of water before heading to a small drum n bass music festival/funfair in a park during late afternoon, where I quickly smoked a 110mm-long joint containing half generic cannabis buds, and half herbal mix (papaya, hazelnut and eucalyptus supplied commercially) while sitting under a tree and collecting my thoughts, away from the crowds. Then I smoked one of damiana and tarragon leaf. I had no MP3 player and instead enjoyed the bass notes from the dance tents about 500 yards away.    It must have been about an hour after I dropped the pills (there was no nausea whatsoever, so I forgot about them) and 10 minutes after the smoke that I felt acutely aware of birdsong and the music, although neither sounded significantly altered. I had a magazine with me but was unable to concentrate on the words, while my attention was drawn to my peripheral vision. The sunlight, into which I faced, appeared glowing but not harsh.    Then I felt heavy, drowsy and twitchy all over, but my vision quickly became distorted like a wideangle lens tilted towards me - the trees flattened, and people stumpy, their heads outsized in the way a baby\x91s would be in proportion to its body. My heart rate surged and I felt a clammy chill, but dismissed this as nervousness at the prospect of my first authentic trip.     I saw no visuals other than brief sparkles of white light in the first five minutes, while closing my eyes briefly. It was euphoric and my head started to feel like it was being sucked to the left. This swirling effect moved to my whole body, which was a bit intimidating until I started breathing deeply, reminding myself that all was well and that the point of taking the substance was to undergo the trip.    Then I became obsessed with staring at dogs and bicycles, both of which seemed bendy and tall, the cycles bulging and their wheels seeming ovoid, the dogs large though friendly. When I tried hard to focus, the effect diminished but it was slightly stereoscopic - the \x91proper\x91 image and the distorted one overlapped. I have no idea whether some of the machines were in fact customised bikes.     My body felt stretched and floating as if wafted by a current, and I \x91zoomed in on some objects, mostly in the mid-distance in front of me. This made me wary as I was dressed less casually than most of the people at the event and I did not want to be seen staring, in case people thought I was a plain clothes cop.    The most striking effect was time slowing down. I felt like I had been at the event for several hours though the sun\'s position told me it was probably still early evening - I was not wearing a watch. I reminded myself on several occasions where I was, that the effect would be temporary, that I was not feeling alarmed or ill, that my surroundings were enhancing the effect,  and that I could easily summon assistance if the need arose.     Going across the park and then back down side streets appeared to take twice as long as normal, the ground seeming unnaturally spongy. I was feeling as if I was only partially conscious. One way of describing it would be like being wakened suddenly from deep slumber while on a airplane or car journey, and struggling to make sense of ones environment as sounds and shapes swim into focus. I became a little dazed on route but moved according to reflex.    Colours did not seem much brighter, which was a disappointment. Despite the dreaminess, I was always aware of where my wallet and house keys were.  When at home I checked the time and from dropping the tablets to returning to the house was about two hours. Rationally I believed this, but it felt like six. By this time the effects were fading, which was a relief as I didn\'t want my housemates to be aware of me being stoned, particularly the visual distortion. I had bright big pupils and red eye, plus was dehydrated. I also felt tingly/numb, particularly my forearms and hands. This could be due to the skunk, which usually makes me sedated.    I have been typing this review while still rather high at three and a half hours after swallowing the caps, and I am listening to some nature sounds (rainforest, ocean, rain) - these seem appropriate as a gentle return to earth. Time has been getting back to normal but occasionally I feel trapped in a \'pocket\' of space-time. There are no obvious munchies, cottonmouth or hangover. Though neurological rather than outright esoteric, I shall use the substances again with interest, but without weed and with more water."
47959,Bad Place,Special K,"Jul 10, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Friday, November 12, 2005     Setting: my house     Preparation: none    Dosage:10 HBWS     no prescriptions, vitamins, herbal supplements, etc.    I had spoken on the phone with my friend, Jill, earlier in the day, about 2 PM. She told me that one of the movie theaters was going to have a midnight showing of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. However, we wanted to get fucked up to watch it, which is the only way that you can understand it. We decided that we were going to buy some of the more \x91potent kind of pot from her sisters friend since we didnt have access to any other drugs/psychedelics. However, we wouldnt be able to buy the marijuana until after 10:00 that night.    I had some errands to run, so I told her I would call her back around 5 PM. Well, my errands took longer than expected so I ended up calling her a little bit before 6 PM. No answer.     I went online for a little while and then got the sudden urge to check the mail. Earlier in the week, I had placed an order for Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds from an online shop. I didnt really expect to receive them yet, but decided to check anyway. To my surprise and excitement I did receive the seeds. Now, I was really going to be tripping while watching the movie.    They were much smaller than I expected. However, they are a different strain [Indian] the online herbal shop had said and were smaller in size and did not have the fuzzy coating. After reading the dosage recommendations, I decided to take a total of 10 (I wanted a \x91heavy trip). I just chewed them very thoroughly and swallowed without removing the seed coating. The ingesting of the seeds was complete at 7:07. I tried to call Jill again to let her know that we could really trip that night, as we had tried with morning glories to no success previously (too small amount of dosage).     Side note: My previous experiences with drugs have been pot, ecstasy, cocaine, dxm, and shrooms. As I had never done acid, I can only compare this trip my one time with shrooms.    At about T:45, I felt very lethargic. I was listening to music on my computer and was very relaxed but I was very cold, the window and fan had been blowing and I was getting \x91chills. Except these chills were waves of tingles that went through my whole body. I had also experienced these \x91chills when I had done shrooms. Every time a felt a breeze, I got the same type of the chills.     At about T1:00, I decided to go lay down in my bed. It felt like I had taken a sedative, except my mind was very clear. I turned off the lights and covered myself with blankets. I was not worried about falling asleep because I wasnt mentally tired, but I wasnt trippin yet either. Im not sure when it happened, but I started to feel very euphoric. I found everything really funny. And I started having weird trippy thoughts. I was only a little bit nauseous, but it felt more like a slight tightness in my stomach. I checked my pupils and they were slightly dilated.    Around 9:30-10:00 PM, I tried getting a hold of Jill again. No luck. Then I called her sister. She said that the guy that deals it doesnt get off of until 10 PM and that she was waiting for him to call her. I gave her my number, since I wasnt with Jill, to have her call me. She never called me back that night, by the way.    Around 10:30PM, I had went to the bathroom. I would probably consider this my peak. The patterns on the walls and tiles were swirling and twirling. My hearing had also been \x91enhanced by the seeds. I washed my hands, and I could hear the leftover suds popping in the sink and it sounded like rice crispies in milk. I did check the next day if I could hear the suds popping in the sink, and I couldnt. It was so loud. But staring down at the sink made me very nauseous. I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldnt decide where I wanted to puke; the sink, toilet, or the tub. I didnt want to use any of them, so I went in the kitchen and puked in the kitchen sink. I have no idea why I decided to puke there, it just seemed like the best place at the time. Toilets gross me out to have my face that close to them and I didnt feel like bending over too much. Plus, I think I was really trying to walk it off, but once I got to the kitchen sink I couldnt hold it. Some liquid came up (the tea I had drunk earlier), and a tiny bit of seed matter. I didnt puke very much or for very long at all, but I still felt like shit afterwards.    I went to go lie back down. I was tripping so fucking hard at this point and the euphoria was long gone. I text messaged Jill that I needed the pot asap, as she had text me earlier that she was going to get it and be back before the movie. I wanted to smoke some to hopefully relieve the nausea. I kept repeating to myself Bad place, bad place, bad place... I tried not to think about that, and to \x91get out of this bad place. But thats all I could think of. And I kept repeating \'10 and 7\' or backwards \'7 at 10\' referring to my dosage. Don\'t know why.    I dont remember much what happened the next few hours. Actually, some of the things I did could have happened earlier that night. But I remember seeing trails, and I played with the light toys that I use when I roll. Eventually, Jill called me back around 12:30 AM. She still hadnt gotten the marijuana and we missed the movie. She was going to go to some other girls house. I told her that I was trippin but she wouldnt come over until I told what I was on. I had told her previously that I had ordered some seeds online, and I let her know that I had take 10 at 7 that night. AND if she had called me earlier, she could be trippin too. I was actually pretty pissed. Plus, she wanted to go to some party, so I told her to come get me.     An hour later, she still hadnt showed up. I called her, and she was at some girls apartment. I told her forget it and to stay there because I was still tripping hard and didnt feel comfortable hanging out with a bunch of people I didnt know. Plus, I was in such a bad place still. When I had done shrooms, I was happy, light-hearted and had a child-like wonderment about the world. I didnt freak out mentally at all. Although, I wouldnt technically say that I was freaking out, but I was in a bad mood and had horrible mindset about everything at that point I didnt want to be around anybody.    I had some introspection about my actions that night. What had happened? Why was I so negative and in this \x91bad place? I didnt really think it was necessary to always trip with others. I had tripped on DXM by myself many times. I think it was because I hadnt planned on tripping by myself. The evening did not go according to plans at all. My friend pretty much ditched me, she didnt know until way later that I was tripping balls, but I figured that had she came over earlier that evening we would have been tripping together. Plus, I had been looking forward to trip. Thinking about how fun it was. I was also planning on experimenting with other legal highs, such has amanitas, salvia, etc. Now, I am definitely reconsidering this. I will probably trip again but with an entirely different mindset and expectations.    I should also note, later that night I thought I was dying. All of sudden a word popped into my head, CYANIDE. I remembered reading about how some seed contained chemicals that the body breaks down into cyanide and could kill you. But I couldnt remember for sure if it was these seeds. I didnt want to check it out online to find out for sure because I thought that if I did find that it was these seeds, then I would really, really freak out. However, I was pretty sure that it was the HBWS. I contemplated calling 911 or poison control, but at this time (about 2AM) I figured it was way too late anyway. When I had thrown up earlier, only a little bit of seed matter came up.     Oddly, I accepted death and didnt freak out. I prayed to god to forgive my stupidity and for all of my wrongs. I apologized to my friends and family in my prayers too. I felt weak, tired and wanted to fall asleep. I figured that when I fell asleep I may not wake up. Should I write a note just in case? Should I call a friend? I couldnt do any of those things; I couldnt move or get off of my bed. I also thought to myself there were worst ways to die. Ive always imagined myself dying in a car crash-not sure why. Then I remembered that I had this really good ice cream left in the freezer. If I am going to die, I wanted that to be my last meal. I finally urged myself out of bed and went to the kitchen and started eating the ice cream. I almost instantly felt better, and figured I wasnt dying but just in case, I finished it off any way. I was barely tripping at this point, although my eyes were still dilated and patterns were still fun to stare at.     I would say that I had underestimated the seeds. I took more than I should have. Also, I need to find out more information on preparation of the seeds, especially the Indian strain that I have. I dont know if I would consider this an entirely bad trip. It was fun at times, but bad also. I mean, I did think that I was dying. I did order a total of 100 seeds so I still have a lot left."
37744,Lost the Beauty,Obscuria,"Jul 10, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Dimenhydrinate,"My first and last bad experience with HBW happened December 24/25th December 2002.    I was interested in taking LSD that summer after reading a lot about it. I didn\'t know anybody that I trusted that I could get actual LSD off but after doing a lot of research and reading about experiences I decided to try and purchase HBW seeds off the internet. I ended up getting them from the Netherlands as back then they didn\'t prove easy to find at a reasonable price. Now they\'re easily purchased. After my experience with it though I believe it really shouldn\'t be readily available because people tend to believe them to be mild and not as risky as taking the real thing, but I don\'t think that\'s true. My first batch came and there were six seeds if I remember right. I scraped the fuzzy stuff off and tried to crush them up in any way I could. After a long while trying to prepare them I decided just to eat them and had a great trip, the best feeling I\'ve ever had. This isn\'t the story I\'m telling though, I\'d rather write about my bad experience.    So after the first amazing trip I found another place on the net to get the seeds. I got them off an american site this time for $15(I live in the U.K. by the way). There were a lot more this time, enough to last me a long time. My first trip was in August, and after that I had one roughly once a month. Each trip got more and more dull though. I had just started my second year of GCSEs and tripping was a nice escape from all that stress. I always knew that general well-being was essential if I was going to be tripping and that no way could I do it if I was in a bad mood or had a bad couple of days. I found doing it out of boredem just made it weird and uneventful. The worst part is not being able to sleep at all. After my trip in November I knew it was barely worth it anymore. I stayed at a friend\'s house and whilst they slept I was up all night sitting on a chair too numb to move. I didn\'t really panic so I didn\'t really class that as a bad trip, but after that one I don\'t see how I could of thought I\'d ever have a good trip again.    Well here\'s the beginning of the real story...    It was Christmas eve and I was thinking of how I hadn\'t taken any HBW that month and how it\'d be fun to take it on Christmas eve. There was no real logic in my thinking then. By the time I bothered to prepare them it was evening. I absolutely DETEST the taste of these seeds, there have a really bitter taste and everytime I think about the taste I feel sick. One of the actual side effect of these seeds is nausea, I always got that for the first hour or so of the trip. I didn\'t want it this time so I took a travel sickness tablet before taking the HBW. About half an hour after taking the tablet I ate the seeds. I bit them in half and then put each half in a bit of milkyway cake bar and ate it, then washed it down with some ribena. They still tasted sick but I managed to get all six of them down. Even though I had gained a tolerance to them I still only took six. After I got that all over and done with I basically got on with chatting on the internet and watching TV.    This trip was quite a long time ago now so I can\'t remember much detail. I must of got really bored, which led to me getting really negative and pissed off. I ended up laying down on my bed feeling extremely sick. It was around midnight and everybody was in bed. Everytime I did HBW I was alone and only stayed in my house and in my garden. This time felt different though, I was very aware I was alone and was getting more and more anxious as thoughts of waking up my parents and telling them I was having a bad trip came flooding into my head. I managed to control myself though and decided to ride it out alone. After a while my head started spinning and I needed to throw up. I was in a complete state. This was probably the worst part physically.    I was lying on my bed, curled up, with my head hanging over the side because I knew I was going to vomit. Everytime I closed my eyes everything spun at 100mph, but with my eyes open everything was just swirling about. Eventually I threw up next to my bed, it was absolutely horrible and smelt disgusting, but I couldn\'t move because I felt so dizzy. Everytime I closed my eyes I could see an army of skeletons in hell marching, and I thought there was a portal to hell in my room and that they were coming for me. That, and other terrifying thoughts just kept circulating through my mind. It felt like hours that I was lying there, but the memory of it all didn\'t sort out the whole warped perception of time.    It was probably around 3/4am that I managed to get up. I knew I was in a state and needed to try and get back to reality. I went to the living room and stuck on Lord of the Rings, I thought it\'d help me focus on something and perhaps make me fall asleep. I think I only managed to watch it for five minutes before I wandered off. I ended up in the lounge where I curled up on the sofa to try and get comfortable and calm myself down. I vommited again, but after that time I felt a bit better. Thoughts and feelings weren\'t so intense anymore and I just felt spaced out and kind of melancholic. I tried to tune in to comforting thoughts about how it was Christmas and how I had a family and a home and all that stuff. It\'s all a bit of a blur now but I sat on that sofa for what felt like an eternity thinking about my life and how I\'d messed it up with all this drug crap. That night really put a lot of things into perspective.    At around 7am I managed to fall asleep only to be woken up about 9am. There was no escaping getting up and seeing all my family being Christmas morning and all. I felt so emotionally and physically drained, no energy at all. I had to try and explain why I had left the TV on and why I had thrown up so much. Things were a lot different, I couldn\'t believe that just a few hours ago I was in a different dimension of my mind. I just wanted to forget all about it.    In retrospect I realised two things made the trip so bad, the first was definitely the travel sickness tablet. I had never gotten THAT nauseated before so it must of been that. The second thing was my state of mind. I *thought* I was content with life but that was a big mistake. I had unknowingly fallen back into depression and that trip confirmed that I was unstable and not fit to be taking mind altering drugs. I swore I\'d NEVER do HBW again. I can\'t imagine anything worst that being trapped in such a hellish state of mind for that long, it\'s absolute torture. So this story is really a warning."
61003,"Memories, Music and Much More",Tripia,"Jul 4, 2007",HB Woodrose & Morning Glory,"Husband (L) and I had a pleasant experience with 5 HBWR seeds each a few weeks ago and decided to up the dose a little. I am more experienced with psychoactives than my husband. We were both well rested and had no other plans this weekend other than this trip. I misjudged how many seeds we had in the pack and realized we only had 6 HBWR left each so we decided to add 20 Ololiuqui (Rivea Corymbosa) seeds to up the LSA dosage. All seeds were obtained from vendors online and were organic.     Preparation:    We scraped the coating off of the HBWR seeds with our fingernails the best that we could - which took a little bit of time. I added the 6 HBWR seeds and then the 20 Ololiuqui seeds into a coffee grinder and ground it as fine as possible. I did one dose and then the other so we had the same amount of material. We then put the material into a large shot glass each and added a shot of Absolut (vodka) Peach to each glass. We have had very positive results (no nausea, no cramps, no ill effects) doing the HBWR the same way both times we\'ve tried it. We let the shots chill in the fridge for 1 hour before we injested the concoction.    T 0:00    Each of us took the shots with all of the seed grit and chased it with crystal light peach tea. Not horrible tasting at all. We decided to make some pasta to have on hand in case our stomachs did get messed up with the mixture.    T 0:20     Both of us comment that we are beginning to feel a bit buzzy.     T: 0:45    Watched old episodes of the Flintstones on cable. Sparks huge conversation on the nature of time in a very Kurt Vonnegut sense (watching the same episode of the Flintstones while you\'re a child while watching it as an adult and both episodes are touching each other). Both of us agree we are tripping after this conversation. Feeling the time dialation very strongly.     T 1:15    Playing with our cats - we\'re both commenting on the fact that we are both more sensitive to touch. Our cats gather around us and want to interact and we\'re both having a great time petting them and also cuddling each other. Very comfortable.    T: 2:00 - 5:00    Decide to eat a bowl of pasta and are now watching Scooby Doo and both in agreement that it\'s one of the best children\'s cartoons in terms of content ever made. Some patterning happening. Time has slowed down and seems like we\'ve been watching the TV forever. Decide that we want to change the mood and light candles, turn off all other lights in the house, and turn on TV. I know this is weird but we turned on a music channel called \'Soundscapes\' which is new age music channel, muted the sound so that we could only see the slide show of pictures which were basically mountain, lake and nature scenes.    L takes out his guitar and I pull out a strumstick (another stringed instrument) and we spent the time while we were peaking jamming on the instruments. We also had fun while L played music to match each of the silent pictures that were coming up on the muted TV screen. Much singing and laughing. Both of us notice that the candles are leaving an after image and I experience some trails. Both of us see patterns and we\'re definitely in a very creative space. Lots of laughing.    T 5:30    Decide to watch Saturday Night Live on television. We were laughing a lot and felt very mellow. Both of us comment that we\'re feeling very comfortable.    T 7:00    L decides to go to bed - I stay up and play video games for 2 more hours. I take an ambien and feel very mellow and very good before going to bed.    Summation/looking back:    This is our second trip with HBWR and the effects were really pleasant. I do not know how much the Rivea Corymbosa added to the trip as we have not had big results using those in the past. We did not have any ill effects at all with the HBWR and both of us commented on the fact that if this preperation works we shouldn\'t deviate from it.  We both had light headaches the day after trip. Creative ideas that we had during the trip have become projects we will be working on. L has commented on the fact that he feels that he had a creativity breakthrough in terms of the guitar and this has helped his approach his recording a little bit differently.     We will defintely be doing this again with possible higher dosage next time."
34948,Pleasantly Psychedelic,Darkstar,"Jun 10, 2007",H B Woodrose,"First of all, I\'d like to share what I believe to be the easiest, and cheapest way of preparing these glorious little goodies. First, take the seeds you plan to ingest, then rub them between a folded sheet of rough sandpaper. This should be done until the seed is light tan in color, and smooth. A few darker spots may remain; that\'s OK. Next, put the seeds into a high quality pepper mill - the kind that will grind pepper into a fine powder. Grind the seeds over clean, dark colored paper. Then, gently fold the paper in half, collecting the seed powder in the crease. Now, pour the powder into a cone-shaped coffee filter, fold it from the bottom up a couple times, and then cut off the excess filter paper. For the last step, put the filter containing the seeds into a small glass, pour in some spring water, and let it sit for at least 1/2 hour.    When youre ready to ingest this wonderful brew, pull the filter out, squeeze it to get the last remaining goodness out, then down the potion. The taste is not bad at all - no worse than green tea I\'ve had at some Chinese food joints! I\'ve used this method on many occasions and have NEVER gotten the slightest bit ill. My friend ingested six seeds via the \'crush, soak, eat, drink\' method, and felt sick to his stomach. I used the method above the next day with six seeds and felt GREAT!    Regarding the effects of these seeds, I\'d have to say that they are extremely pleasant. I\'ve taken LSD hundreds of times, and LSA is experientially similar. The salient differences between the LSD experience and the LSA experience are the following:    1. LSA peaks later in the trip.    2. LSA does not give me the tight - almost nervous - feeling that I experience with LSD. Indeed, the effects of LSA are more like alcohol; somewhat sedative and very pleasant.    3. Visuals are nowhere NEAR as intense with LSA as they are with LSD. Generally, with a medium dose, I will notice trails, the \'fan-effect\' of light, and slight patterns. Everything will seem bright and colorful, but not overly so.    4. LSA puts me in a contemplative state of mind, and allows me to focus \'in between\' my thoughts, where the real Jewels of Consciousness reside. Conversely, with LSD, my mind is cooking along at light speed (not always a bad thing!).     Overall, I\'d have to say that LSA is a wonderful substance, The best way to describe the experience is \'pleasantly psychedelic\'. If I am looking for an \'ego death, mind blowing, life on the head of a pin and exploding into billions of fragments\' experience, than the best choice is LSD, in my opinion. However, if I want to dip my feet into the psychedelic stream, but still remain tethered to Earth enough to carry on a conversation, I\'d go for LSA in the form of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds."
31984,Encountering Myself,MaybEtard,"Jun 10, 2007","H. B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Tobacco","I am a freshman in college. I have experienced the effects of many different drugs. MDMA has always been my favorite, along with LSD, which I have only used once.     This experience was my third LSA trip in two months. I first experienced LSA earlier that year from Morning Glory seeds, but never got the full trip. The first trip on LSA from HBWR seeds was very powerful and allowed me to explore certain parts of my consciousness effortlessly. I spent the evening chatting away with an old friend, allowing us to grow a lot closer in the process. After this, a hilarity and lightness of body was experienced and I was unable to fall asleep until about 7 hours after I took the seeds.     For the trip in question, I cleared off the fuzzy cover of five seeds. Then, I soaked them in warm water for about 2 hours. After washing the seeds some more, I chewed them and drank them down with some water. It was a Friday afternoon. I was feeling very good, and very excited that I would trip during the day and get to see nature in daylight. My mind was fairly clear.     T0:30 About half an hour after dosing, while watching the movie Pi (one of my favorites), I went over to see my friend Jer, in the room down the hall. He was excited about my trip and said that it would be better if I smoked some cannabis. I was already beginning to feel a little light and funny, and I said ok. He gave me a small bud, and not having smoked weed in about 50 weeks, I ripped off a fourth of it and said, this is enough.     T1:30 Following this, I loaded the top quarter of a cigarette with the cannabis-tobacco mix, and finished watching Pi, as I came up higher and higher. I went outside to have my weed-a-rette and once I took those warm tokes, only one full pull of actual cannabis, I already began to feel good. I sat there on a bench in the smoking area in my dorm and then I saw my floor mates near me smoking weed. Once I finished my cigarette, an RA and a dorm official came outside to smoke. I decided I would stay a little bit to draw their attention from my neighbors. I sat there, smoked another cig, and talked to the RA and the dorm lady. They were talking about some pointless boring things and in the middle of the conversation, I began to feel warm inside and began to see them in extreme detail. In another minute, I began to feel overwhelmed by this sensory clarity and began to see little ripples in front of me, electric rips in space time. I left their company and headed inside.    During the 20 second walk from the door to the elevator, I was experiencing full blown hallucinations. I could barely see past them, the rips in space time. It was as through the world was now filled with holes. I waited a second for the elevator to come, and when I stepped in, with about five other people, I could not even see their faces. I was immersed in the hallucinations. At this point I was thinking only, Why did I do this? I thought that I messed up, that now I would feel the overwhelming state for hours and probably get sick. I got to my room, took off my jacket and sat down. And suddenly, the hallucinations subsided and I was feeling better, and stronger, and my trip suddenly became great and amazing. I felt both the lightness and sedation of the LSA, as well as the body buzz of the cannabis. My thoughts were very clear and focused. I sat and listened to music for about an hour and did some writing.    T 2:30 I decided to lie down and relax and think. I ended up experiencing a strong visionary state during which I was able to deal with parts of myself I did not want to affect my thoughts and actions. I encountered a part of me which was always scared, paranoid and just in general weak. This part of me began to overwhelm me and make me feel afraid, until I had a thought I never really had before, Why be upset and weak?. The thought blew my mind and I arose from my state and just walked around the dorm feeling incredibly happy.     T 4:00 The cannabis buzz was gone, but the seeds were still working their magic. I felt pretty euphoric and my mind was still clear. I went to the dining hall to get some food, and walked around outside for a while, chain smoking cigarettes, which tasted very good. Everything outside looked so gorgeous, and I kept looking up at the sky and feeling overwhelmed. I saw this guy who lives on my floor, someone I have been a bit infatuated with for a while, and I realized why I like him, because he reminds me of a guy who had abused me when I was younger. I realized that liking people who remind me of this guy sets me back, and I am usually attracted to guys like that. I always thought that the guy abused me out of some twisted version of love, but I saw that I am just rationalizing something traumatic to create the illusion that the events of 6th grade didnt fuck me up. I felt so relieved.     T 6:00 With my renewed appreciation for life and myself I went out with a new friend of mine and we talked about relationships and drugs for hours. I felt very open and very happy.    T 9:00 I felt down, but still elated and energized for hours. Truly my most intense psychedelic experience, with absolutely no ill effects. I am very thankful for this experience because I feel a lot more mature and stronger now, able to deal with the pains of living and the fears around me. The trip was half a year ago and I still tell myself, Stop it! when I become anxious. Of course the trip could not perfectly solve all of my problems, but it gave me a new perspective on them. I am surprised however that the early synergy of the cannabis and LSA led to a few minutes of full blown hallucinations."
58843,The Steps to Eating a Bagel,ConRad,"Jun 6, 2007","Amanita muscaria, H.B. Woodrose, Kava Kava & Leonotis leonurus","Background: 150 pound male in my early twenties. I have many years of drug and psychedelic use. I use kratom and DXM frequently. I am also a very anxious person which I take clonazepam for. I just got out of jail and live at home with no job. For most people with my anxiety and my life at the moment I would not suggest any psychedelics. I do them anyway despite all rational thought.    I go over to one of my best friends house. His parents are gone for a few days taking his younger brother to college so we have the house to ourselves. At about 4pm the FedEx guy comes and we receive our order of 1oz of Amanita Muscaria mushrooms, 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and liquid extract of kava root/wild dagga. The only one of these 3 in which I do not have previous experience with are the amanitas. My friend A and I first took out the mushrooms and divided them in half. I consider us both crazy and we tend to do everything big so we each eat a half ounce. We both have empty stomachs with the exception of 2 pieces of very airy wonderbread each in which we made amanita sandwiches and we chased the mushrooms down with a glass of apple juice mixed with some kava/dagga tincture. We wait now. It took a while for the mushrooms to kick in. Looking back I\'m not sure I even know exactly when reality stopped and the mushrooms took over. After a couple hours both of us also decided upon eating 12 HB woodrose seeds each which we ate about 7pm.    A was sitting on a chair and I was sitting on the couch next to him. We began speaking very deeply to each other about meaning of life stuff and it was apparent that we were feeling the mushrooms. The funniest part of this in retrospect was that A was convinced he was feeling the seeds full blown by now. It had been maybe 2 hours since ingesting them so I can see how he would think that.  The mushrooms were very intense indeed but only on a mental level. Absolutely no visual or audio hallucinations. Although I will say there was a very intense sensation waving through my body which I cannot describe but found to be pleasant.    We sat around A\'s house for a while. We decided to eat some food. I found some wheat bagels which looked very tasty. Everything looked tasty really and I wanted to eat it all but eating didnt actually sound good. We ate the bagels anyway. It sounds alot easier than it really was however. I ended up having much trouble opening the cream cheese and I dropped my bagel. Eating it was even weirder. I found it was quite chore to chew and swallow, I was definitely much more conscious about it than usual. A and I found this extremely funny that we could not eat our food. I even spend a good few minutes writing out the steps to making and eating a bagel, which were ridiculous but fun to do. I even kept the paper.    By now I know that we are both tripping very hard but it was still all mental. No visuals at all. I decided that was about all we were going to get. I should also add that A was even more of a skeptic than I on this matter. He was convinced it was already over. I decided I was ready to go home. It felt like we had already tripped for days. In reality it was only about 9:30. Time slows down a great deal on the Amanitas. In fact it seems to have no real meaning at all. I rode my bike home, which was pretty ridiculous as it was below zero and is something I normally hate doing. The 3 blocks back to my house seem like a mile in weather that cold. This time I was very cold but didnt mind it very much. I actually thoroughly enjoyed riding outside. The ride also seemed very short. Before I knew it I was home.    Once home I found my family was gone. I decided to make popcorn and watch TV which is something I do a lot. I wasnt really hungry but food sounded good and popcorn is easy to eat. While watching Punky Brewster on DVD, which is a show I really enjoyed as a kid, I found myself smiling at it alot more than I normally do. I usually find it entertaining but quite ridiculous, as it is a kid TV show. I was very into it though and I was very happy to say the least when all the made up TV problems ended up OK in the end. I even laughed out loud in the dark. I couldnt stop smiling. My mom and sister came home. I dont feel like Im tripping very hard so I stay upstairs. I said a few stupid things to my mom and sister and my mom said \'you look stoned\'. Well because I am on probation and get piss tested rather frequently I tell her \'I cant get stoned\'. I said this with a HUGE smile on my face, something I tried to force away. She said \'well you look something\'.    My mom and sister went to bed and I got up to change the DVD. I should add I found myself doing very odd things and not thinking anything of them. For instance. I felt like so much had to be done and there was no end to the little tasks I kept finding myself to do. I was still very happy though. I finally realized after a few minutes that if my mom came out of her room I would look ridiculous so I got some more popcorn and pretzels and retreated to my room.    At this point I became extremely worried. I kept playing over in my head what my mom said to me and I kept worrying that she knew I was high. I hurried up and took off my pants and got in bed so I could pretend I was sleeping. It was about 10:30 now. I normally dont go to bed until about 2 am. After lying in bed for a few minutes and I thought hard about it, I realized I was just tripping and there was no need to worry. I also realized that even if there was reason to worry I was high and couldnt do anything about it until morning anyway. This was when I first realized I was only beginning to feel the seeds. At this, I thought about my friend A and what a surprise he was in for. He thought the seeds were already gone.    I watched School of Rock. Choosing a DVD was an unusually difficult task. I kept changing it until I realized it really didnt matter what I watched. During the whole movie I kept smiling and laughing at nothing. I had to remind myself that my mom slept right above me and I couldnt laugh too loud. Once I even tried to stop smiling just to see if I could do it. It couldnt be done. I found this even funnier. I got really into the movie and ate my popcorn and pretzels. I could write about that experience for pages. it took me forever to eat my popcorn because I examined every piece carefully with my lips and tongue. Tactile sensations were insane! It was almost as intense as while on MDMA.  I didnt stop moving throughout the whole movie because I liked the feel of my bed sheets on my legs.    After the movie I began falling from the seeds. I believe the mushrooms stopped working somewhere during the movie, but I could be wrong. Sensations became less exhilarating and my muscles began to cramp. Classic for LSA. I got really tired and decided that I should probably sleep. This was about 2:30 am I thought about going to get a job in the morning. I slept for a couple hours and woke at 4am. I felt very weird and had to remind myself why. I fell asleep again after a few minutes of being awake. I awoke again at about 8am. My dad was waking me up like he normally does. I got scared because I was still tripping and pretended to be too tired to wake up so he wouldnt notice anything. Before I forget, let me say my dad was never there and is only just now on his way home from his business trip. Its 7pm now of the same day.    I fell back asleep and had intensely vivid and superbly strange dreams. I dont normally remember my dreams. I thought I was at a movie with my dad the whole time until I awoke for the last time at almost noon. My dream consisted of Spongebob Squarepants and how he was a giant machine out to kill everything I will never be able to explain this dream properly. All the main characters were the characters of the SG-1 team on Stargate SG-1 and even in my dream I felt like it was a movie I was watching with my dad. I even mentioned how cool is was all the characters were from that show. It didnt even register that that would have been a ridiculous movie had it really been made.     It is now 7pm and I am still feeling very weird and spacey. Some of this is due to the wild dagga I drank when I got up, as it has a very similar stone to marijuana, but most of this is the seeds. I will also add until about an hour ago I was extremely depressed all day and havent done anything at all really. That all goes back to my being such an anxious person in a bad place. Overall it was a VERY intense yet enjoyable trip. The only thing I would change is I wish I would have had previous experience with amanitas so I would know how much of my trip they were accountable for."
35286,A Highly Successful Experiment,Black Octagon,"May 27, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Mushrooms,"Ever since we began experimenting with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, my friends and I have been very impressed by the incredible clarity and control we seem to have over the LSA experience. For this reason, we very quickly became curious about using it in combination with other substances, notably MDMA and Psilocybin. Although unable to find any experience reports of people combining LSA with mushrooms, we nonetheless became more and more curious. Even though this \x91experiment was no doubt risky given the lack of available information about this combination on the internet, what ensued was an experience so enlightening and \x91right that I struggle to do it justice with words alone. Read on.    A friend and I prepared 8 seeds each by scraping the outer coating of fur from them to minimize the nausea we usually feel in the first two hours of an LSA trip. We had also picked 10 average-sized mushrooms (Golden Caps) during the two previous days, all of which were very fresh and healthy and kept so via refrigeration. These mushrooms were split evenly between us, having been cleaned and diced.    T (2:30pm)  We ingested the seeds in my friends living room with a glass of water each. For the next hour and a half we relaxed on the couches, listening to DJ Sashas new album (Involver) and playing chess. During this time we were very relaxed but became increasingly lethargic and even slow-witted at chess. We also experienced some slight nausea and gas, which always happens when we take LSA.    T + 1.5 (4:00pm)  I began to feel less nauseous and increasingly tactile and tripped out. I experienced some minor hallucinations when looking at the carpet, which seemed to \x91breathe with life, and when looking at pictures on the walls. My friends dog (Ollie), who had been with us the whole time and who had been quite playful and energetic, seemed to pick up on our vibe and joined us in lying down on the floor and dozed off! This was very cool and allowed us to relax even more into the experience, which by this time was increasingly enjoyable yet still quite mild.    T + 2 (4:30pm) We left the house to go for a walk and watch the sunset at the reserve behind the house. I dont usually feel like walking on LSA but I actually found it to be quite fun this time. My head felt very warm as we slowly floated across the grass towards our favourite lookout. We were becoming increasingly thoughtful and talkative, reminiscing about the last time we were at this spot. It was clearly going to be a nice evening, with a very clear but warm sky, which is rare for an Australian winters night. As the sun began to disappear over the horizon, I took a deep breath, thought here goes nothing and pulled the container of mushrooms out of my backpack.    T + 3 (5:30pm) It was a little bit difficult to stomach the mushrooms, even though we only had four or five each, which under normal circumstances would only give rise to a mild trip. I never feel like eating on LSA, and the nausea was not completely gone yet. We thought we would probably vomit at some point during the night, but we never did. Within 10 minutes we felt much better, with significantly more energy and a desire to go exploring. We walked down a canyon to sit amongst some flat rocks in the middle of a stream where we could listen to the water, animals, wind and trains in the distance.    As we approached the canyon my mindset rapidly changed from the dream-like buzz of the LSA to one that was extremely awake and euphoric. This was a recognizable \x91come up of mushrooms, but I felt that the LSA made the come up much more smooth and tactile than usual, that is, without the usual feelings of slight anxiety and confusion. I was experiencing all the usual brilliance of the mushrooms, only much stronger and with much more clarity. My only worry was that this was quite  powerful for so few mushrooms, and I didnt know how far this would go.    T + 4 (6:30pm) My memory of this is a little hazy, but for a good while we lay on the rocks amidst the stream, silently contemplating the incredible power and life that is the natural environment. The water and frogs seemed to be communicating about something very meaningful. The visual effect of the dark trees silhouetted against the bright and colourful (pink) night sky became increasingly pronounced and beautiful, and I found myself gazing at it in wonder for many minutes.    We gradually emerged from our meditations and became increasingly talkative. As it dawned on us that this experiment was turning into a real success, we became increasingly excited and giggly, with warm rushes of energy and adrenaline not unlike the MDMA experience. I had the constant feeling that \x91five minutes ago was too intense and wonderful to put into words, but also that the LSA had let me appreciate each facet of it with extreme clarity and calmness. The synergy was incredible.    T + 4.5 (7:00pm) We walked up towards the train tracks and lay down next to them, looking at the sky. Very quickly we began peaking as the stars suddenly started to dance and change colour. We began to think and talk about life and how lucky we were to be having this experience. We also became increasingly articulate in discussing issues of global politics, particularly environmental ones, despite being \x91off our chops.    I had closed-eye visuals unlike any others that Id experienced before. I should point out that even when taking psychedelics such as mushrooms, I usually have far fewer and far less intense visuals than my friends as I tend to be geared more towards aural stimuli. But these visuals were incredibly vivid, colourful and \x91fast, with lots of fractals and spinning serpents. Again, I had the subconscious inkling that this would normally be too much to handle, but that the LSA empowered me to go with it.    T + 5.5 (8:00pm) After a good hour of intense excitement and wonder we finally began to calm down. The earlier LSA-induced nausea had subsided and we became incredibly hungry, not least because we felt the need to indulge all our senses. We went to a party at a friends house where a Thai feast ensued, as well as considerable conversation and music. By this time we were very much coherent, which was odd because by this time we would usually be in the throes of an LSA peak. However, this did not bother us, for we had a strong \x91afterglow of the previous couple of hours. So we proceeded to get very drunk for the rest of the evening, with merely a light alcohol hangover the next morning.    All in all, we remembered the experience very well and felt rejuvenated for about a week afterwards. Once again I emphasise the incredible clarity that overwhelmed the experience. Too bad for those wanting to just get fucked up and incoherent, but I would definitely recommend this combination to anyone with the basic grounding in psilocybin who wants to fully grasp the intensity as well as to explore further combinations. I am yet to try the MDMA&Psylocybin hippy flip combo, yet I instinctively feel that LSA would greatly potentiate and complement the experience of both substances."
26254,A Wonderful Experience,Cynapse,"May 26, 2007","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Mind Machine","Devices Used:  PC with Bwgen playing 10Hz binaural beats through headphones  Homemade LED glasses running at 5-10Hz over 30 mins    Set:  I am feeling fairly well and have no other specific plans tonight or tomorrow.    Setting:  My bedroom in the evening.    Notes:  I have taken LSD many times before, but this will be my first LSA experience.  I am not currently taking any prescriptions, medications, or supplements.    Preparation:  I carefully scrape the fuzzy coating off of 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, grind them to a powder with small chunks in a coffee grinder, and let them soak in purified mineral water for a little over an hour, shaking occasionally.  The water turns greenish and then ends up mostly brown.  It is run through coffee filters to yield about 1/2 cup of brown water.  I am intentionally starting out with a low-end dose just to play it safe.      Experience:    T  Begin drinking, the taste is not necessarily good, but at the same time pleasantly mild and non-bitter, especially compared to most things.    T + 0:25  Finish drinking.  No effects yet at all.    T + 0:35  Ok, I\'m feeling some effects now.  Hard to describe, but I feel slightly \'electrified\' and a tiny bit restless.    T + 0:50  The same effects continue, getting slightly stronger.    T + 1:00  I am definitely in a happy mood.  My surroundings seem a slight bit surreal in a way.  I\'m a little bit \'burpy\' but otherwise feel fine with no nausea.  I find myself just randomly smiling a lot.    T + 1:10  I am noticing a very slight resemblance to LSD, but much smoother & milder.  So far this is really cool.  Some minor LSD type yawns and \'permagrin\' coming on.    T + 1:20  A minor bit of jaw tension.  The very beginnings of what would probably turn into nausea at larger doses, but hardly noticable.  Overall, still feeling very good.    T + 1:30  Running up & down the stairs a few times feels like I just finished a race and I\'m somewhat out of breath, although the effects do seem a bit more noticable now.      T + 1:40  Now I feel a little bit like I\'m tripping on LSD, and my surroundings are getting more surreal.  Still no nausea.    T + 1:50  Quite restless, keep pacing in circles, can\'t stay sitting down.  Breathing is a bit heavy.  Waves of pure joy and excitement keep coming over me, making it hard to stop smiling for very long.  I now see what people mean when they describe it as a cross between LSD & MDMA. :)    T + 3:20  Feeling completely wonderful.  Not a bit of nausea.  Been talking on the phone with a friend for a while.  Very talkative, trying to explain everything.  There seems like an infinite number of things to talk about.  I can hardly contain my excitement!!!  Had a bite of strawberry cheesecake icecream, which tasted virtually orgasmic! :)    T + 3:35  Smoke a hit of cannabis through a water bong and lay down and listen to 10Hz binaurals...    T + 4:10  Holy shit!!!!  I kept having random images/memories from my past pop in my head along with some subtle patterns, although now I can\'t remember specifically what any of them were in particular.  Then out of nowhere the twitches started.  It was as if laying perfectly still for too long caused some kind of energy to build up in my body until it finally just released into a random muscle, in this case causing my left arm to spontaneously jump a few inches over.  It felt almost like getting zapped with a stun gun, although it didn\'t hurt at all.  It just kind of freaked me out.  This happened a few times, getting stronger each time until I got up.      T + 5:35  Smoke another hit of cannabis, put on my homemade LED glasses and some tripped out music by Mystical Sun, and lay back down.  This music sounded so good it\'s indescribable!  I found myself automatically picking out each and every individual sound and clearly seeing how they were all put together in such a beautiful way.  After a while I came close to having a full OOBE.  It\'s like the whole network of invisible connections that tie your \'self\' to your body just dissolve away, leaving me kind of just floating there within my body.  Definitely a feeling that cannot be explained to anyone, but has to be experienced.  I finally fade over into sleep for probably a good 9 hours and wake up feeling a little \'different\' but physically and emotionally fine and somewhat spiritually fulfilled.    Afterthoughts:    I would have to say this was the best trip I\'ve had in quite a while, right up there with some of my LSD + MDMA trips.  At times it got a bit hectic while trying to talk on the phone or use the computer, but with the help of THC and lying down with music I was able to stay calm and focused.    cynapse"
62950,Death and Rebirth,Opaleg,"May 23, 2007",H. B. Woodrose & Amanita muscaria,"I want to start with a short comment, one should never mix two substances that they have never experienced, regardless of research invested. I have only tried Ghana HBW and was not familiar with the Hawaiian type or with amanitas. Note that this is not being written as it happened, but I was sure to notice the milestones.    +0:00h I cut 3 seeds in half and drink them with a soda. I cut a cap into three or four sections and do the same to consume them.    +0:30h I know that for both substances, this seems to be the point of activity, however I did not notice a thing.    +1:30h I start to feel lightly different, insofar as feeling ambitious, and I start feeling really creative and write poetry. At this point I take 6 seeds and another cap of amanita, using the same method.  The combined weight of the 2 caps was 8 grams. This was probably what meant the difference between a very pleasant experience and the very real nightmare I had. I was dumb enough to mix these two things, instead I tried boosting it.    +?:??h Nothing beyond the above. I notice that time seems to go by incredibly quickly.    +~7:00h I was slammed with effects. I feel twitchy, but it would be explained better as shifting in bed, only I was awake and not in bed. I could not stop moving and shaking and shifting around. I keep writing and my girlfriend comes home, and I explain the experience to her. This was just the beginning of the nightmare.    We go to Taco Bell and I get about three things, when I pump gas I bound and leap around from the car, to the store and back. So far the experience is actually not unpleasant, but I notice a sick feeling.    +~7:30h I try to eat, but only manage to get down a quesadilla, looking back, this may have saved my life, and certainly allowed me to vomit the poisons out later.    I try to lie down and go to sleep, and I cannot. I notice split second lapses in time, probably drifting in and out of sleep. Every instance of the time lapses, I \'wake up\' terrified of something unknown.    +?:??h I must have fallen asleep as I wake up feeling like I slept, but I know something has gone terribly wrong. I cannot stop shaking and shifting around and I feel like I am being tortured to death as I get nothing from the very little sleep I manage. I beg my girlfriend to kill me, I beg myself to die and I keep wanting to go to the hospital but I don\'t want the police involved so I try waiting it out.    I go to the bathroom and wretch, the vomit is slightly dehydrated, so each hurl only pushes it out further and further, then a torrent of vomit manages out. This continues for a while and I am very glad to get rid of the poison. Then I feel very weak, but a lot better. I intermittently return to vomit, and I drink water to rehydrate, a lot of water.    From here the worst effects end, and I slowly just shake slightly, and find it hard to type or walk. My mind feels broken and I feel like I am slowly dying. My heart beats incredibly fast for hours.    I try sleeping but can\'t for more then a few minutes or seconds.    +9:00h I continue to rehydrate but my body absorbs it too fast, then I pee, and drink more water. The whole time my girlfriend helps me and consoles me. While she sleeps.  It was early morning, about 5 to 7 a.m. so I understand. I just go pee and drink water.    +11:00h From here on I just shake slightly and feel sick. I enter a cycle of feeling my soul leave my body, then feeling fine. I keep trying to sleep, but can\'t. For another 9 hours I feel terrified of my girlfriend leaving for school, then work. I feel frail and weak, vulnerable and other things. When I finally manage to fall asleep at about    +20:00h I sleep. I wake up the next morning feeling happy to survive. Throughout the day I feel nothing negative. I would randomly shake and feel sick. I would also recall the experience and feel terrified."
28900,Talking to Myself,Day Tripper,"May 20, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"I once bought 14 HBW\'s from a shop in Manchester, UK. They were black & cost me \xa320 for the lot. The guy in the shop had never done them before & didn\'t really have any idea what they could do to a person.    I took them home & checked the internet whereby 5 was supposed to be the standard. In preparation, I scraped the black from the seeds using a pen knife & placed them whole in a cup of boiling water(1/4 full). Left them there for 3 hours then took them out of the water, crushed them up, put them into a small bottle with the water they had been resting in & added a little more water.    I shook them up vigorously then left them for another hour. At 8:00pm that evening I sipped down the murky water that had become, shaking it again beforehand. I sipped it slowly for 20mins.    About an hour later I was beginning to feel a little funny, my feet felt extraordinarily light whilst walking from room to room & my eyes were kind of pulsating. I thought this was due to me watching the telly at first but when I turned the telly off, the pulsating was still occurring.    About half an hour after this I was finding things to be quite amusing. The fact that nothing was really amusing kind of made it even more amusing!! However, I was feeling a little ill by this time so I had a spliff to chill out the nausea.    Come 10:00pm, I began to watch \'The Office\' on telly which made me laugh quite often & I felt quite comfortable watching it, although still feeling nauseated. By 10:20pm I was beginning to worry. My main worry was: What am I going to do after The Office finishes? I realised I had the first series on DVD so at 10:30pm I went upstairs to watch it.    By 10:45 I was board of watching The Office & wanted to do something else. Tried playing Solitaire but the cards seemed to be jumping around a bit & it was making me feel sicker than I already felt. I was feeling rushes & seeing minor visuals. I thought I was definitely up by this point & at a peak.    11:00 - Still didn\'t know what to do with myself. The wallpaper in the spare room was looking quite interesting & a lego man image on a skateboard seemed to be moving his hand up & down but then stopped when I looked directly at it. I could feel that I had progressed even further since I last thought I had peaked.    11:15 - Put some music on, Dreamfish. WOW!!! By now, things were really hotting up. I put my head back & just lost myself in the music. It was like as if the music new exactly what I wanted to hear. I Began to imagine that there were numerous other people in the room with me. It wasn\'t as if I could see them, but I could feel there presence. I had many deep conversations with them. Strange considering they weren\'t even there but I managed to find out so much about myself during this experience. I should have written it all down but I don\'t think I would have been capable. I even had a debate with somebody(nobody!) about who was rolling the next spliff. I ended up rolling it in the end because the person who wasnt there kindly reminded me that, well, they werent there!! Still felt sick by the way, with no signs of the sickness diminishing.    11:45 - The third track on my Dreamfish CD came on & I couldn\'t make out whether I liked it or not. It seemed to make me feel even more nauseous than before. I was twitching around, trying to find something to do again but everything I thought I wanted to do just seemed to become boring within seconds & then Id want to do something else.    11:55 - Wanted to go to bed, although I think this was just another false idea. Went to my bedroom & got into bed. Didn\'t bother getting undressed. Turned the light off & closed my eyes. Sleep had no chance!! Every time I closed my eyes, all I could see were 10 kaleidoscopes all rotating at the same time. Don\'t be fooled, this felt really horrible. I felt as though I wanted to go to sleep but the HBW wasn\'t letting me. This became an instant worry for no apparent reason. I opened my eyes & turned on the light. Put the telly on & tried to watch something. It was useless, I ended up just channel hopping because I couldnt concentrate on anything for long enough. This also became an instant worry bearing in mind that I still felt ill at this point.    12:10 - Burning up! Opened a window, still feeling hectic, sorry, FRANTIC!! Began to march around the house rubbing my head thinking I was going to die & become one of those \'silly boy\' drug death statistics on TV. I remember thinking how perfect it would be if I did die - almost textbook. I also began to pretend that I was showing somebody around my house as though I was selling it or something (ie: heres the kitchen, needs a bit of work blah blah blah). Walking did help, though, mildly.    12:20 - Went into the bathroom, all walls were breathing. The tile effect on the walls was sickening & seemed to stretch on for miles & miles. Ran out of the bathroom whispering \'I don\'t like that room\'. Went back into the bedroom, sat on the bed. Considered phoning a friend, considered going for a walk. Decided not to go for a walk as reality had been removed, therefore, I probably would have been knocked over or something.    12:30 - Still sat on my bed thinking - this is it, I can\'t go on through the rest of the night like this. I honestly felt suicidal because I felt so uncomfortable with myself & the way I was feeling. I noticed that pain didn\'t really have any affect on me as I tried biting my fingers hard but couldn\'t really feel it.    12:35 - Still felt sick & thought maybe if I could be sick then the horrible feeling would go away. I went into the bathroom & knelt in front of the toilet, still thinking I was going to die. I looked up at the ceiling, it seemed to be so far away. Walls still breathing, couldnt physically be sick so decided to get a beer to see if it would relax me a little.    12:40 - Got a beer from the kitchen. The kitchen was dark with some dirty dishes knocking about. It seemed as though they were watching me & I became a little paranoid but just laughed it off. Walking out of the kitchen there was a lamp next to the door. Whilst walking past it I nearly jumped out of my skin. I thought there was somebody stood there!!! Even when I departed up the stairs it still looked as though somebody was stood there!! Sat back on my bed with my mind still racing. By this point I actually wanted to die just to stop myself from feeling the way I was feeling. It wasn\'t the nausea but what was going on in my brain. I just felt uncomfortable in my body & didn\'t want to be inside my own body anymore. Also felt like bashing my head against a brick wall.    12:50 - Remembered how much of a good feeling it was listening to Dreamfish in the spare room until that nasty track came on that made me feel sick. I went into the spare room, sat down & began to play the CD from the beginning again.    MUCH BETTER!!!! The music took me again & began to calm me down.    01:00 - Began to talk to people who weren\'t there again but felt good, loved up, happy, deep, less nauseated but most of all, chilled. The sensation I was getting at this point can only best be described metaphorically as taking my head off my shoulders & putting it on a roller coaster whilst my body stayed on the ground.    The roller coaster went down low until the affect of the HBW was at a minimum. Then, it would climb high & fast until the affect of the HBW was at a maximum & then rush straight back down. Like a kind of build up before a climax. I remember wanting to feel like this forever.    01:10  Feeling extremely chilled, no sickness whatsoever. Head rolling back, eyes closed on many occasions. Decided to take a lie down whilst listening to the music. Opened the sofa bed, got under a quilt & turned the lamp off but left my globe on.    This was a brilliant idea!! I just lay there staring up at a patch of light reflecting off my stippled ceiling. The light was moving in all kinds of directions & seemed to fill up with what looked like fizzy water. This made me laugh out loud. I looked around the room and everything seemed really noticeable, as if I could just sit & analyse everything. I looked at a tiny picture on my wall of a holiday resort. I felt as though I could leave my body & enter into the picture. I stopped this from happening but if I hadnt, I may have had an astral projection at that point. I lay down & enjoyed this feeling for sometime, the light on the ceiling was most interesting!!    02:00  Began to feel the affects slowly wearing away, now. Still felt happy but a little disappointed that I was beginning to come back to reality. Tried to close my eyes to go to sleep but was not able to.    03:00  Still high but on the way down. Arms & hands felt very weak at this point. I propped my forearms up on my elbows but didnt make any attempt to hold my hands up. They just flopped down whilst I swung them around a little. This felt very weird but particularly uncomfortable.    03:30  Wanted to go to sleep by now. Whole body felt weak & quite achy, too. Found it difficult to close my eyes & getting a little agitated. I tossed & turned for a bit & think I managed to sleep for about 15  20 minutes.    04:30  Got up & went to my bed. Went to sleep with no bother.    Woke up the following day feeling a little groggy & nervy but not too bad.    Now, you have just read what happened to me after taking 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. The following weekend I took another 3 with a friend who also took 3. The effects were OK but really I just felt very stoned more than anything. My friend, who had never done them before, said that he had some visuals & that he thought the seeds were quite nice & mellow.    I think its really amazing how just an extra 2 of these things can make a person really lose it like I did & also give off the fantastic visuals I experienced. Maybe it was because I was on my own. I have to admit, doing these things with a friend was much better. That way I always knew that I had somebody there who was real, who I could talk to just to bring myself back down to earth when I needed it.    Anyway, the real point of this story is not just to describe the effects of HBW but something else. The seeds themselves. When all my seeds had gone I decided to buy some more. I looked on the internet for the cheapest price & managed to get hold of 70 for $12 shipped from the US to the UK. These seeds were fresh & DID NOT come with nauseating black crap on the outsides of them.    What happened? I hear you ask\x85NOTHING!!! The following evening I tried 5. This time I chewed them for 20 minutes & then swallowed them. Still, not even a twinge. A couple of nights later I prepared 10 seeds in the same way I had prepared my original, mind blowing 5 seeds. Still nothing. The night after that I chewed 15 seeds but there was no effect. I dont understand what has gone on here. The seeds look exactly the same, minus the black crap, they taste exactly the same but do not hold any effect whatsoever.  I guess some seeds work and others don\'t.  I am waiting on an order from another company.    Imagine what 30 effective HBW seeds would do to you if it only took 5 to make me feel as though I wanted to die. Bearing in mind that I have taken Ecstasy, speed & mushrooms many, many times, therefore, I do have a little experience with drug taking.    5x HBW was like nothing else I had ever taken before. To sum it up, it was like taking Ecstasy, speed & mushrooms all at the same time. The ecstasy came with the luvvy feeling, the speed with the not knowing what to do next feeling & the shrooms for the trippy feeling."
62362,Wading the Shallow End of Psychedelia,Synesthesia,"May 14, 2007","H.B. Woodrose, 2C-C, DPT & Cannabis","My Calea Zacatechichi Induced dream from the previous night, with the subliminal expectation of a light, spiritual/personal trip, woke me early in the morning primed and ready for an expedition of sorts.    9:10 - I Drank an extraction of LSA from 7 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds prepared from the night before. The seeds turned out to be rather weak, but had some minor body rushes, CEV\'s, slight mood elevation and slight nausea. The visuals were of fleeting geometric vistas suggesting old dynasty Ancient Egyptian or maybe even Sumerian architectures, on a grid of infinity. The colors quite dulled down, I attributed to the lack of potency in the seeds.    11:15 - I Took out a pre-measured dose of 100mg of 2C-C, split it into 4 equal parts, and encapsulated them, then swallowed one. I had read that especially this type of Phenethylamine took quite some time to kick in. This was my first experiment with 2C-C and I was a little anxious as to the effects, and had not prepared myself nor had the physical time for Ego Death or a full on trip, so I smoked alot of homegrown high grade Cannabis. So I didnt really notice too much of the effects as I came up.    I painted for about half an hour totally entranced and amazed by the textures created as I painted, I was mesmerised by the colors, at times, it could get a little intense, but it was easy to keep under control. A slight buzz in the head, or the beginnings of a headache started. I continued to smoke cannabis throughout this time as the effects of the 2C-C were somewhat light.    Went inside to lie down on the couch with some chillout and enjoyed some slight CEV\'s, there were small times of intense euphoria, which were apparently psychosomatic, as the only body load I ever got was from the Cannabis. The type of visuals were lacking in character, quite randomised bits of hypnogogic images overlapping generic lava-lamp type fluid visuals. I soon realised that I wasnt in the mood for daydreaming. This was about the time I realised I was thinking slightly differently, more lucid, from multiple perspectives. I found that it had become very easy to concentrate on mental problems and solve them, without getting distracted by any powerful visuals or sensations. I found it to be very analytical (Not self-analytical), and that it significantly enhanced the aesthetic appreciation of music and visual-spatial relationships.    As I got bored I concluded that it was safe to go out and resume my daily errands in the city. As soon as I left my spirits had lifted immensely, I walked through a park during the beginning months of spring, and I suddenly became aware of all the natural beauty around me, totally astonished by all the trees. I continued to stroll around the park admiring all the details of nature. The walk was a beautiful one, which allowed for introspection, deep thought on several required subjects, and simple wonder at how subtly psychedelic and therapeutic this substance was. It reminded me of a light dose of Acid, with a clean head high tinged with Mescaline type thought patterns. When the scenery changed from beautiful blooming park to crowded and dilapidated streets of Istanbul, the visuals adapted to a more very sublime and subtle Escheresque visuals of morphing, rusted buildings, similar to oil paintings I have painted in the past.    I ate outside, and completed my errands, and walked back home, I had peaked somewhere on the walk but have no idea as it was so as I approached home I decided that a tiny cosmic touch was needed to finish the experiment.    14:20 - Arrived home and prepared a bowl with fine Cannabis laced with (eyeballed) approx: 10-15mg of DPT. Put on Shpongle\'s Tales of the Inexpressible, relaxed and took a deep, long hit. It wasnt much, but enough... about 2-3 minutes after smoking, I was overcome with sensory and physical intensity and an intense euhporia swept over me. The effect was quite like bypassing the tricky parts of the mushroom trip to the bare essentials and effects. Walls morphing, fractal textures, high frequency shimmering ect, but I was like looking through a veil of yellow cosmic fog. The music\'s depth complexified immediately, I closed my eyes for a couple of minutes in fractal and snakelike cheshiresque morphing hallucinations that gradually gave way to the kaledioscopic DMT or LSD type visuals. Slight nausea set in but it wasnt a problem.     14:30 - Got up and repeated the hit. This time the experience was very similar but much more intense, tripping hard for several minutes I closed my eyes to fall into an abstract psychedelic dimension that I could pull out of at will. When I awoke maybe 10 minutes later, The world seemed completely different, like I was born again. It felt as if a great weight had been lifted, I was in a state of euphoric catharsis. I indeed did feel centuries younger...    The afterglow was extremely pleasurable as I write this, the afterglow resembles the Salvia afterglow but in a much more positive light. In conclusion I was quite satisfied that I had both completed my daily chores and errands, painted and worked, while having bursts of insight, euphoria, shallow and sublime psychedelic excursions without the messy ego death, paranoia or anxiety in half a day. I have cooked dinner for my wife who is to arrive from work, Im extremely positive and feel reborn. I could easily have doubled the 2C-C dose, for quite a full trip. I would like to repeat the experience however, I would prefer to replace the LSA with Mushrooms or good old Acid in the future.    18:30 - Cleaned up the house, had a couple of beers and smoked a little more Cannabis while I watched some tv, had a small snack, and a wonderful shower.      I feel highly charged, creative and motivated, most likely to enhance the afterglow with some kratom extract, and additional cannabis, folowed by A Calea Zacatechichi Tea and Calea joint before bed to complete the cycle..."
52830,Insanity & Therapy,Psychonaut,"May 9, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"I had an urge. A strong urge to try LSA..    I placed an order on 20 high quality HBWR seeds. Me and my friend had decided to take 10 seeds each to achieve a full trip. Previously, we bought an HBWR extract which was total garbage, none of us felt anything. The seeds arrived. I compared the seeds to some pictures on the Internet, and then called my friend and told him; \'This is the real thing\'.    Then the day finally came. It was a Saturday and we had both been longing for this new experience. I arrived at my friends house at 7 p.m. We grounded the seeds, 10 at a time, and mixed the well-ground powder into a shot glass, stirred and finally added a little bit of orange juice.    First we tried the \'sublingual absorption technique\' for about 15 mins, swirling it around in the mouth. We felt nothing from this, so we both ended up swallowing the mixture at the exact same moment (8:30 p.m.). We then sat down, relaxed, watched some TV and waited for the effects to kick in. Suddenly, after about half an hour, we both began to feel energy tingling in our bodies. I felt so happy and extatic. I started laughing at absolutely nothing! Just laughing like a madman! When I looked in the mirror my pupils were dilated as hell, nearly no iris was visible.     My friend said he couldn\xb4t stay inside for another minute. So we went outside, walked around for a bit, laughing and talking. I started getting minor, barely noticeable, visual distortions. Spots of blue, green and red appeared in my vision. Our behaviour and thoughts were beginning to get really strange. My friend said it would be a good time to go inside now, as we both felt the effects creeping up, stronger and stronger.    When we came inside, we shot a really silly fooling-around video on his cellular phone cam, and then he started interviewing me about embarrasing topics. I couldn\xb4t sit still. My stomach and bowels felt really messed up. My friend said that he wanted to vomit. I felt the same way to. But we never barfed. The urge to vomit was easily defeated and we both started feeling better in our abdomen rather quickly. All of the sudden (memory loss), I was lying in the bed and my friend was lying on the couch.      *0 a.m.*       I became aware that the peak had begun. When I looked at his balcony door, it had melted, slanting to the right. I looked around me and, basically, the whole room had started to melt, bleed out colors and shifting colors. I laughed when I looked at my friend, he, like everything else in the unreal reality I was in, looked cartoonish. He had shining Mickey Mouse eyes. Suddenly, these cartoon eyes melted down on the sides of his face, and after this he melted into a colorful twirl and disappeared. I thought that the TV picture was the only thing that still looked real in my environment; but OOPS! suddenly the light from the TV expanded, smeared out and shone with all the colors available. The picture became intensly deep, shining with an heavenly white light and rainbows grew out on the edges. Sounds were extremely prominent and distorted at the same time, shifting directions and sources.    My jaw felt really tense, my throat was filled with mucus, and my bladder was filled with urine. I took a piss, and then, 5 mins later I pissed again. I was so focused on keeping my body functions stabilized, so I drank lots of water to not get dehydrated from all the urinating. Numbness shifted around in my body, but it was mostly located in my chest.    The peak of the peak kicked in. My tense jaw loosened. EVERYTHING in this unreal reality started whirling. With my eyes closed, I saw a large colorful whirl which I dubbed the \'LSA whirl\'. When I opened my eyes, colorful whirls appeared everywhere, combined with melting, bubbling and color bleeding visuals. My arms, jaw, tounge, eyes, hearing, speech were whirling. I wasn\xb4t walking around anymore. I was WHIRLING!    I whirled around the whole apartment, drank some colorful whirly water :-S, and went into the bathroom to take a piss again. I looked at the floor and thought \'What the hell is this?\'. The floor was bubbling, whirling and bleeding out colors. I began to feel a bit of motion sickness, so I finished up quickly and went out.    My friend, who actually tripped even harder than me, if it\xb4s possible, asked me why I was making funny faces and touching my chest all the time. I replied with my whirly speech: \'Iieuieioouu douououounnnnt knnnooouuuwwwoa!\' (Translation: I don\xb4t know!). I checked myself in the mirror. What I saw was a totally insane whirling cartoon character. It looked like I was made out of shining fluids. My whirling jaw started to melt off.    *About here (4 a.m.) my friends trip started to take a frightening (but life-changing) turn.*    I was back in bed again and talking with my friend. That\xb4s when things happened to him. He nearly fell down on the couch from his sitting position, eyes shut, and fell into something I would describe as a hypnotic trance, similiar to a spiritual medium being possesed by a spirit. His breathing sounded wheezing. He mumbled out lots of repressed painful memories, and I acted as his therapist. He cried heavily, tears were soaking his face. Due to the nature of these memories, I can\xb4t tell them, but I can describe them as extremely serious and horrifying. He also told what kind of person he really is.     Then he came to again, laid down beside me in bed and asked me if could fall into the same state, but I said that I couldn\xb4t. However, a little while later, after telling him how large and spacy his tiny apartment is, I fell into the same state. My painful memories were all set free. I had never before realized how much pain and trauma I held within, and I came to the conclusion that my whole life had been one big traumatic experience. Tears were streaming down my face, cleansing my psyche of trauma.  My friends voice was so calming and intellectual, like I had never heard it before. His true self had emerged from within, and that true self\xb4s personality nearly was like mine.    This part of the trip lasted from 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. (I checked the time often, when the trip momentarely dipped down).    *Insanity (7:30 a.m.)*    We had both been lying in bed semi-conscious for half an hour. When I came to, the bed was filled with what seemed like hundreds of pillows, which I don\xb4t remember being there before. The room looked strange, everything had shifted place, and the colors were constantly shifting. The \'melty\' visuals were still there, but not everywhere like it was before. My friend came to also, but he was acting totally insane. He started saying things like; \' We\xb4re going to die together\', \'I want to live in this trip\', \'Don\xb4t leave me ever, I don\xb4t know what I will do\', \'I don\xb4t deserve to live\'.   After he said these frightening things, he went into the bathroom with tears on his face and a pencil in his hand. I seriously thought of locking him in there to protect myself.     I was still tripping and became extremely paranoid, but I briefly came to my senses and figured out another technique to calm down the situation: to talk him calm. He evetually came out saying that he had figured out what\xb4s wrong with the chemicals in his brain. He had written a \'poem\'(?) that read \'I need a drug in my life to balance the chemicals in my brain\'. When we read the \'poem\' in sober state we were both surprised how insane it sounds, but also how beautiful and clear he writes when tripping, compared to the barely readable scribble he writes in sober state.    All of the sudden, he started putting his clothes on, saying \'Nothing matters anymore.\' \'I\xb4m going to tell everyone that I have been using drugs.\' When he said this, I grabbed him and locked him between my arms without any problems (I\xb4m bigger and stronger than him. Lucky thing for both of us!) I spoke to him calmly about the severe consequences of such an idiotic action, and also repeated the mantra to him \'It\xb4s the drug speaking, not you\'. He calmed down so much that it seemed like nothing had happened. We sat down and talked and smoked some cigs (sleeping was impossible).      Then he said he felt unclean and needed a shower, which led to that he walked around the apartment for about 1,5 hours before he finally did it. He also was determined that it was life important to eat, drink and showering at the same time. We thought in our LSA-twisted brains we could speak through telepathy. I tried to send my thoughts to him that said \'Take a shower now!\' :-)    I was wondering if was going to be tripping for the rest of my life, and thought up strategies of how to live with it. I was so exhausted mentally. Finally, at 2 p.m. the next day,(17 hours!) the trip had completely subsided. I had aftereffects for seven more hours. It can be described as being born again, seeing the world for the first time and being totally amazed of all things, big and small, that you experience. The day after that I was so totally energized and went to the gym and did a workout consisting of 7 exercises in 40 mins. When I came home after that I cleaned my room clinically clean. The day after that it was back to old lazy me :-)    LSA made a stronger positive impact on my friends life. He is happier, more social, orderly. He is climbing out the dark void that was his past life.       *Summary*      LSA is very powerful that shouldn\xb4t be underestimated. I got a powerful trip but I felt that I could handle it (most of the time). My friend, on the other hand, lost control completely. Without me there, both of our lives would have gotten even worse. My friend, who have done nearly all drugs, amongst them mushrooms, DMT and LSD, said that LSA is the most powerful substance he has used, that he never has lost control so much on any other drug.    Even though we were hanging on the edge of getting signed in permanently at the looney bin, it was the best therapy there is, bringing out repressed memories and truths. At least, that\xb4s the effect it had on us. It made us even closer friends and we have much deeper understanding for each other now. After using HBWR (LSA) both me and my friends urge to do drugs have decreased significantly."
58476,Liquid On The Inside,Yosef,"Apr 28, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"This report is about a bad trip I took on LSA (or ergine according to Wikipedia) from Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. I am 16, and suffer from depression and social anxiety. Psychoactives I have taken: Alcohol, Nicotine, Marihuana, Codeine, Dimenhydrinate (Stupid, stupid, stupid!), XTC, MDMA, DXM and amphetamine. I think I may have a borderline substance abuse problem, or at the very least am developing one.    Set & Setting:    I purchased these seeds online, approximately 90 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds, grown right here in South-East Queensland. According to a drug user on a forum I frequent, these seeds are high quality and very potent. I had used these seeds twice before. On the first occasion, I threw up after half an hour, then after three hours felt the most amazing euphoria imaginable, equivalent to MDMA. The second time was a day later, and with a friend of mine. We had went for a walk that night, which seemed to stretch out for hours but in reality lasted 45 minutes at most. I had trouble getting to sleep, and feared I was slipping into a psychosis. I fell asleep for what seemed like only a second, and woke up several hours later. I spent the day feeling fairly disassociated. 16 days later, we decided to try 10 seeds each. We were in my house, sitting in the kitchen. Fairly relaxed, and we were in a good mood after watching the DVD of \'Rock Profile\'. My little brother was there with us, he was sober and aware of what we were doing.    Dosage and timing:    I crushed up 10 seeds each and put them in two mugs with some water. Due to the inconvienance of parents , the seeds soaked for perhaps half an hour. Dose taken at 10 pm approximately. Effects were felt within half an hour.    The Trip:    As we were watching the DVD, I noticed my vision seemed much better and my friend and I were both enjoying the show greatly. When it was done we rushed to the kitchen to play some music (he on bass, me on guitar and my brother on keyboards). We only played for a short while before my friend went to the toilet, thinking he was going to vomit. My brother and I followed shortly, and my friend, R, sat next to the toilet as we tried to comfort him. R started to feel better, and we sat in the bathroom talking for a while. I was chewing a piece of gum, and all of a sudden it felt as though the the gum was becoming nothingness inside my mouth, as though the inside of my mouth were a black hole. That was freaky! We then went to the kitchen and R put on a CD he had brought over with some tunes he felt said a lot about modern society. I was really digging it, then as my younger brother, B, started taking pictures of us in the dark on his phone, all I could do was lay on my back and get lost in my own thoughts.     I considered the decline of society, was the Cultural Revolution we were part of causing this increase in mental illness? I know I certainly felt out of place in modern society, and that this alienation was leading to my depression. My mind felt overwhelmed with the sudden realization of the grave state the Western World is in. I felt helpless. I considered the time just before the 60\'s, the 50\'s. The conservative, yet stable society that existed back then. The most important thing for the world to achieve is stability, yet we were spiralling towards massive upheaval and instability it seemed. I began to think that perhaps I, who considered myself a progressive, Left leaning sort of guy, is perhaps a very conservative person in real life. The experience was exposing a part of my personality I had often hidden, and was forcing me to think about my fears and mental problems. I think that perhaps since I didn\'t confront it, this led to the bad trip I was to have.    Time seemed to stretch out quite a bit, and I am not sure what time it was when we decided to go lie down. It was at least 1:30 am. I think. Anyhow, I was lying in my bed curled up when I suddenly felt my brain shake in my skull. Now I know the vibrations I felt were my own doing, I was simply clenching my jaw which was causing the sound and feeling, but under the influence it was amplified massively. It went on and on, and I decided that I was dying. I had been having suicidal thoughts recently, and this may have been the trip bringing it to light and shoving those thoughts in my face. I felt my liquid in my mouth, blood. I felt my insides turn to  liquid, and I imagined the brain shakes I was having were a seizure, and that I was in my death throes.    After dying for around half an hour I decided to visit my friend in his room. Fast asleep he was. I woke him up and explained the situation. He excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I heard my mother stir. I leapt back into bed and reassured her that I was just unable to sleep. After she went back to her bedroom, I went back to R who was back in his room. He began telling me it was OK, the trip would end eventually. This calmed me down, and eventualy I went back to my bed. The seizures started again, my organs liquified and I felt as though I were on the verge of \'Knockin\' On Heaven\'s Door\'.    R and I went to the bathroom, and I asked if we should go to my mother and tell her. He was reluctant, he didn\'t want to get in trouble. We sat there ten minutes and I had a glass of water, and still was very frightened I was going to die. Words cannot put across the absolute fear I felt, and I was very remorseful for the fact that not too long ago I had welcomed death\'s arms.    Eventually we woke my mother, showed her the seeds and explained the situation. She rang Poisons Control, and they recommended taking me to the hospital. I was still hallucinating, the road seemed so long, and plants and walls breathed and moved in the hospital rooms. My mother signed me in and gave them the bag of HBWR. They looked up the seeds on the computer, and I told the nurse they were meant to have LSA, or lysergic acid amides, in them. She was telling me that she knew what LSD is, and that there is no LSD in them. That made me feel so indignified, but I controlled my urge to yell and shout and explain what I was talking about, of course there wasn\'t LSD in them! I\'m not stupid, I\'m just trying to help!    Eventually the doctors gathered enough information to decide that the best thing for me would be to let me wait out the bad trip in the hospital bed. The \'medically concerning\' thing was the alkaloids, the Doctor said. My heartrate was fine, though my temperature was high. They plugged me into a drip and put 2L of fluid into me over the next few hours. I lay there either watching the exit sign breath and distort, watching the walls breath or just being lost in my mind. I can\'t recall sleeping, but when I got up to give a urine test it was daylight outside. I left the hospital just before 8. I would just like to take the opportunity now to give a shout out to the staff at the St. Andrew\'s Hospital in Brisbane, who were very professional and did a great job. They even gave the seeds back! To my mother though...I haven\'t seen them since.    For the next couple of days I felt out of it, as though things weren\'t quite real. My parents have arranged to take me to a doctor and to counselling to try and mend my depression. Two days after the experience, I had a rather bad anxiety attack at work, the first time it had happened there. Usually I love work, I love being around my friends there but that day was different. I have also experienced depression, although I do not think it is related to my trip, rather to the continued alienation I feel from society.    In conclusion, I will most definitley pursue experiences like these again. When I get some replacement seeds, I will stick to doses of 8, and try and trip mainly in the daytime which seems to be better for me. Take my advice, and start off at around 5 seeds. It\'s better to have the experience under your belt before attempting something big."
42609,Very Physical and Surreal,Hardts,"Apr 25, 2007",H. B. Woodrose & Cannabis - Hash,"I recently asked one of my friends about mescaline, and where you could get it, he told me about a Danish (I\'m Danish myself) site called, shows that the store was actually located quite close to where I live (In the middle of Copenhagen). I thought mescaline was the same as the HBWR seeds at the time. After reading a lot, Me and some friends decided to go down there and have a look at things. There where 3 of us; Me (Ill call myself \'Hardts\'), Simon, and Daniel. I expected that I wouldn\'t talk about ingesting anything bought from the shop since most of it is illegal. Because of that, we did a lot of research about the substance before going down there. It turns out, that the store clerk was happy to tell us anything we wanted to know about the numerous substances they had in the store.    After hearing about many different things, we settled on the HBWR seeds for which they had in many variants, they had the second class type that costs 100 DKK for 3grams (about 25 seeds), and the first class seeds which where more expensive, but also much more potent (1grams for 100DKK, which is 10 seeds). He told us, that it would be easier to control since a much smaller amount of seeds where needed. 3-10 seeds are recommended with first class seeds, while with the Second Class seeds you would seem to need to triple the dose. So we choose the First Class seeds. We also bought some Tibetan incense to fit the mood of this weird legal drug.    Anyway, we went home to Simon. Firstly, we prepared the seeds by removing the coat, chopping them up with a ridiculously small knife for which I got a little annoyed that I had to use and then I put the seeds in three glasses of water. We chose to do 5 each, since that was what the guy in the store recommended for beginners.  After Making the \'drinks\' ready, we rolled a nice big Joint, and went outside. He lives in a nice place full of nature, yet still in the middle of the city. In Denmark we call it a \'Garden community\', but Im not sure thats correctly translated.    Anyway the time was about 8:30 pm, we went out for a little walk to smoke the Joint.  We where all exited of what to come of course, and talked about it. This is the first time I have ever smoked a joint with a purpose other than getting stoned, this time it was different. We did it because we had read it would prevent any possible nausea that might occur after ingestion. Therefore none of us had any of the usual excitement about smoking, It\'s not that we are not used to smoking, we do it often and enjoy it every time. But this time we just smoked, and it was a funny way to suddenly realize, that you where stoned. 20 minutes later or so we went back, and I dont actually remember if we went to a store to buy some beers and smokes before we got back, or if we did it later, but that was the plan, and we did.    When we got back to his place (none of us live in our own apartments yet, we are all 18-19 and so on, but live at home) we where quite stoned. I remember being so stoned that I, for a minute there, got cold feet about the whole thing. We did after all smoke a good big one with some expensive hashish I got a few days earlier.    We took the three glasses out from a shelf we had put it in, and placed them on the table. The setting was good, he\'s parents where out to a party, and would probably come home drunk later, which was very fortunate so they wouldn\'t really notice that we where tripping. We where all exited as we began drinking the liquid. It was green! I had read some reports that the taste should be bad, I however never noticed this. I couldn\'t taste a thing because I was so stoned, so perhaps that was a good thing.    We started to drink it about 9 pm I think. Daniel actually said, after taking the first few sips, he felt something weak for a moment there, something that wasn\'t the hashish, something else. I subsided that idea since I had read that it would take approx. a few hours before the effects would start to show.    An hour after, knowing that we should be close to the start of the trip, we warmed up some food he\'s parents had made earlier, but that we had turned down because many reports says that its a good idea to keep an empty stomach. This however was a bad idea, It felt very weird to smoke hashish on an empty stomach. The food was good, really good, but halfway or so through my lovely meal, something happened. I suddenly felt my face being very heavy. The feeling came very suddenly, and moments after they confirmed that they felt it too. I didn\'t really want more food at that point, and I had to admit that I needed to lie down a bit. I felt some nausea, and had felt it rising.    A funny thing, when I stood up, I noticed how bad my balance had gotten!, I had very bad my motor skills, something that I found very entetaining as it got worse throughout the night. I actually fell, and had to support myself at the kitchen table. Simon and Daniel watched me with surprised looks, and Simon said \'What are you doing..?!? walk straight man,\' or something. Anyway, I felt bad, so I wanted to go lie down. So thats just what I did.    I should note here, that I have a few problems with stress, sometimes it\'s really serious, and it\'s sort of a vicious pattern of thought. I don\'t necessary have to be stoned, drunk or whatever for it to happen. I can also say, that sometimes it works like this: I sense the thinking of the thought of having the stress, and then I quickly think not to think the thought resulting in thinking exactly what I\'m trying to avoid thinking. Very unpleasent.    Unfortunately, thats kind of what happend to me when I lay down. The stress got really bad, and at one point I sort of tried to releas it by letting it take over, trying to be careless, but that made it worse and my heart was seriously pounding hard now. It feels sort of like a fire in my stomach that I have to keep under control. If I loose the control, it takes over and just spreads very rapidly, extremely unpleasant. I think much of it was caused by the fact that I was very exited to see what would happen, and this would trigger the stress.    Luckily, I actually got it under control at one point, and it sort of disappeared, something that never happens at any other time. Usually it takes a few hours before I can get it of my back, weird. Anyway when I stood up and walked to the kitchen, at about +1:45, I noticed just how bad my motor skills was.    What followed was Interesting. When I got back in the kitchen, they where sort of done with their food, and could now (like me) feel the effects. They got up, and we went into the living room, and I brought the rest of my food. Eating it was a great challenge, I felt like it was the first time I ever used my body, and it was a completely new instrument to me. My motor skills where very rough, only able to do basic tasks.    This was interesting, because I felt like at the same time, that my mind was separated from my body which gave the impression that I could watch myself behaving in this odd way, but werent able do anything about it! I was also very visually disoriented; I would sit back in the sofa, get up, walk around the sofa table and then look at the sofa from there. That was apparently to big a task for my sense of direction, I just could not believe that I was looking at the same room.    Another thing I noticed was, that my physics felt like I was back in the oral phase!  I constantly wanted to put things in my mouth! also because of the crudeness of the physics, I actually noticed myself drooling at one point.    Communication was also limited to simple sentences, it wasnt that I couldnt think or anything, just that the ability to stay tuned on the same thought was a very hard task. Therefore, every time I spoke, I didnt get very far before I suddenly interrupted myself with there mere thought of What..?, What was I saying? How can I .. I dont remember.. or something like that, so speaking was hard and actually quite entertaining as it was reduced to ridicules sounds later on as it was so hard.    For long time, we just sat there in the sofa listening to music, and trying to talk, and smoking a hell of a lot of cigarettes due to the oral phase thing. Not that I think we wouldnt if we hadnt eaten the seeds, cause I always seem to smoke a lot when ever I\'m drunk, stoned or anything in the thereabouts.    Anyway, at one point we decided to go outside. It took us about an hour before actually made it outside because of the communication problem! Simon who lived there, insisted that we did the dishes (or that he would do them at least..) before we went out. I tried to do it, but it was simply to hard as my motor skills where only very basic.    Finely later we got outside. The problem here is, that here is a leak in my memory, sorry, theres a black hole. I simply cant remember where we went or what we did outside! I only remember getting back, and he couldnt figure out how to open the door hehe. Luckily he succeeded after about 5-10 minutes of jerking with the keys! At least I think 5-10 minutes went by, but that could of course be my sense of time.    Anyway, we finely got inside and began the process of taking our shoes off. That took ages, and we didnt get done before hes parents actually stepped in the door with the words THATS IT! They wanted to scare us for laughs, and certainly succeeded! We all got a shock, and immediately responded with a Emh, we, of course. The panic quickly subsided as we saw their expression shortly after. Very embarrassing. We went into Simons room and at this point (2 am I think) we were sobering up. However the three of us still had huge pupils and very poor speech abilities.    After half an hour, a guy name Aske came over very drunk, and told us about what he had done and so on, he wanted us to come to a party which wasnt really a party and was closing up soon. We then came to the conclusion that we didnt plan on doing the seeds anytime in the near future so we might as well just eat the rest now, and see what would happen. We had bought 20 seeds in all, Simon had only had 4 in stead of 5, so that left us with 6 seeds remaining.    We ate them through same procedure. 1 hour later when Daniel had gone home and Aske too, we started feeling the effects. They where nothing like the trip we had had earlier but more like a taste of it. Now it was at this time my trouble began. Because of the stress I have mentioned earlier, I always have difficulties sleeping. The seeds didnt help of course.    I didnt fall a sleep before 10 or 11 am the next day. I just laid all night while my stress completely took over. Then I fell a sleep and slept till about 1 am when We woke about the same time, unable to sleep anymore which is highly unusual for us. That was indeed one of my worst nights but it was well worth the experience, next time I wont be eating to more seeds later on hehe. Stupid idea. Something interesting is, that none of us experienced hallucinations, I believe it would take a higher amount of seeds for that, so next time I will experiment with 6 or 7 seeds.    When talking after-effects, I would like to mention, that I was slightly visually disoriented the next day, and the following day after that. I couldnt recognize shapes and colours until close range. Oh yeah, and my pupils where still big with my right one being significantly bigger\x85 ?!? So that was our trip. A very interesting drug the I would do it again.    Until next trip,  Hardts"
44030,Vast Unpredictability,Michael,"Apr 24, 2007",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose,"I am going to share two experiences with The LSA containing Woodrose, once when I tried it myself for the first time and the second with two of my friends. This might give an indication of the unpredictability of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose in terms of effect and mood.  I acquired a back of 50-60 or so seeds from a Herablist. All nervous smiles, passing stuff under the counter, knowing winks; this is Australia and The Woodrose is illegal here. She told me the seeds were very old and so therefore their potency would have worn off.  My first attempt was during the day while my best friend was around. This was my first experience into anything hallucinatory, unles you count marijuana, which gives me a number of psychadelic experiences: dilation of time, choppy movement, warped perception etc. I consumed eight seeds because I was convinced into thinking their potency was weak; I presumed I\'d be taking the equivalent of five and that would give me just a titilation, if anything. I scoured the seeds of their hairs and downed them with anti-nausea drugs to cover my bases.  The first two hours I basically felt stoned. I was quiet, passive, withdrawn, but had that odd \'calm feeling before the storm\', a feeling like something like you\'ve taken something that is counter-intuitive of the body\'s normal function but at the moment it is still latent. Alongside a feeling in my stomach like there were small lead weights weighing it down. Anyway I went for a walk with my friend to take my mind of the slight nausea, and after a couple of hours we basically got bored with me acting quiet and detached and left. I went back to my room feeling sleepy and was thinking \'great this just makes me feel stoned whoopdy doo.\'  Then, for no apparent reason, I had the singular urge to lie out the back with a beach towl. It was a beautiful warm day, and the back yard is full of plants and birds; it was when I was lieing there, my mind gradually but rapidly began to change. Firstly I was admiring nature, basking in the warm glow of the sun, watching the rays slowly move, listening to the birds, and then my hands started digging into the dirt and it felt absolutely WONDERFUL! Old childhood memories started flowing, and I felt like I wasn\'t hallucinating but that my mind felt more aware and clarified- I was getting swamped with insights. It was soonafter I had two thoughts that were a catalyst for the hallucinatory phase: the first thought came to my head when two birds were fighting, that was \'Aren\'t trees and plant so elegant and graceful?\' while \'Aren\'t animals so loud, clumsy and vulgar?\' the second thougth I had was that I felt I wanted to sink into the ground and lose my human form and be part of the earth forever.  At that instant I jumped up with this immense feeling of Euphoria. I felt I had just died and was reborn. The garden was so vibrant! Shapes formed in my visual periphery, I felt meglamaniac, like a god, soaking in the power of the nature around me. If I felt great before the rebirth, for the next half an hour I felt as good, if not better than my best MDMA.  I rang up a buddy to tell how great I felt but then had the thought that he wouldn\'t understand. I wanted to ring up everyone else I knew to tell them how great I felt, but stopped myself; at the back of my mind I felt I would sound stupid and no-one would understand. This was the beginning of the goodbye good phase. I listened to my favourite songs for a while, they felt GREAT! Then I went into the bathroom and noticed that my arms appeared as though looking through a microscope; felt I could see every bacteria on my skin. The bathroom was looking cool; the room\'s edges seem to distort in odd picazzo like forms.  I went to lie down in my bed, and noticed fractal patterns forming on the venetians. Slowly, I became frustrated that my thoughts became too flickery, I couldn\'t focus on anything in particular, and I was alone in my experience and no-one would understand. It was at that moment that one of my rellies I was living with came home, and even though he knew I was experimenting and was cautiously cool about it, the timing couldn\'t have been worse. I was thinking \'now I have to act normal, he will think I sound stupid and pathetic and I\'m incapable of doing fuck all at the moment.\' So I walked out and attempted a conversation, I sounded okay but incredibly spaced out, and I will getting filled with paranoia. I felt like back when I was 14 getting caught with stealing my parents booze; like a naughty boy who was messing with things he shouldn\'t be.  I went back to my room, and was thinking \'I\'m stupid and immature, why did I take these? Oh my god this is what they call a bad trip, I CANNOT have a bad trip, this will last forever?\' I closed my eyes, got weird keleidoscope visuals, so looked at the curtains again with their fractal pulsating waves. Yes, I was in stereotypical bad trip territory in an hour, but I got through my worst stage by throwing up in the toilet and having a shower. This seemed to make me feel \'purged\' of my negative feelings.   [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    By then I felt better so I drove 5 minutes to a friends place (silly me this was only 5 hours into it) and felt drained: I spent the whole night feeling relaxed but unable to get to sleep for ages, the friend was helpful though, he had taken LSD before with a bad trip so could sort of sympathise.  Although in that experience I have never felt happier OR more paranoid and pathetic within an hour of each other, I took some seeds a few weeks later with two of my friends at my holiday house. I thought the bad parts the first time was a result of unsympathetic environmental conditions.  Anyway I consumed 7 seeds, My guy buddie (let\'s call him guy) took 7 and my gal buddie (let\'s call her gal) took 9 (from scant memory.)  We all started off feeling the same: That sedated stoned feeling for two and a half hours, feeling vaguely poisoned and tampered. After a couple, we all diverged into our own experiences. Mine was the least interesting; my head started hurting, and my nausea got so bad I puked in the toilet and then felt ill enough to go to bed. Nothing much happened from thereon: I was tired (hey it was 1 am and I had been drinking the night away) but I could only half sleep; my mind had the scattered thoughts again but they were bareable.  \'Guy\' did NOT have a good experience. He felt tired and sleepy at first, had scattered thoughts that wouldn\'t go away, had what he says to be \'half an hour of absolute joy\' and then more scattered yet vivid thoughts they could not hold his attention too and were driving him insane. Around 6:30 in the morning he was half balling his eyes out, and I had to drive him home where he knocked himself unconscious with antihistamines.  \'Gal\' on the other hand claimed to have her best time EVER. The next day she said she could not remember having a better experience. She was quite content to walk around the naked, soak up impressive visuals, and have the kind of trip that we all take these things to get.  The moral of the story is this: 60 seeds all from the same bag, and I assume the same few vines. Both times I tried I had a completely different experience (or non experience the second time.) Three of us, taking the same substance together, ended up diverging on COMPLETELY different paths. The kind of effect almost seems to be chosen arbritary. Environment and mood does play into effect, however on my second time everyone was in a pretty neutral mood.  \'Guy\' will never even look at the things again. \'Gal\' doesn\'t want to take them again because another trip will never replicate the best trip of her life, and I MAY take them again but I think I\'ve moved on already. \'Gal\' has San Pedro growing so I expect we\'ll be munching away sometime soon. I\'m also budding for some DMT, Ketamine, and 2C-B sometime soon but no hurry. I think I\'ll try everything at least once, but LSA (at least from the Woodrose) is a little too unpredictable for my liking."
46785,The Spectral Plane of Pain and Pleasure,Nicholas D.,"Mar 13, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"My best friend, the initiator in my involvement in the journeys of psychedelia with my first breath of cannabis, traveled two hours just to surprise me with a bag of fifteen Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds of medium-quality.  At first I was skeptical, of course, and chose to experiment with the salvia divinorum first.  It was low grade, and I experienced nothing from it.  The seeds were ground into a powder with a mortar and pestle, and I drank it with the salvia tea/coffee mixture I had made.  The salvia did not effect the experience.    The experience was at first as if I were rising and rising, the chakra points flowing upward from the base of my spine and filling my temporal lobe with a euphorant rise that could be described as an inflation of my head with nitrogen and letting it float just above my body.    \'Man, I\'m fuckin\' feelin\' it,\' I whispered.  My roommate Shannon had taken ten, and so did Jeff\'s girlfriend.  None of them got anywhere with it, considering they had a smaller dose and had recently eaten.  I was on an empty stomach, and was experienced in meditation so was able to channel it in a more propagating manner.  The threshold was common, similar to psilocybin.  The hallucinations were the results of a hefty bowl of decent cannabis that had set the experience in full motion.    Threshold (occuring in twenty minutes after ingestion):  chakra points producing massive endorphin flooding, and concentration on the heart or the head yielded a floating, almost overly intense high.    EXPERIENCE:    I told Jeff I was feeling it, most assuredly, and that it was fucking awesome.  I wanted to write down some of the thought-processes, but they were slightly altered and confused and disappeared back into the subconscious to come back later in a different form.    The hallucinations were not as profound at first.  I\'ve smoked high doses of marijuana and seen amazing spiral activity in my retinal fields, this was similar to the rise of LSA.  I began to feel the nausea, but dismissed it as the salvia.  If I done research before hand, I probably would have had a better experience.    The purge.  Wonderful and terrifying, it is as symbolic as it is uncomfortable.  The vomiting was over, in the bathroom, the nausea like a vise around my stomach that clenched and released and made me swoon in vertigo.  The trip was definitely becoming intense, and I propped myself against the wall of my two-bedroom apartment and was blessed with consolation from both Jeff and his girlfriend.  My roommate was not feeling anything, and she left.  After the experience began to intensify, I was actually worried about her suddenly \'coming up\' and not knowing how to handle it.  I vomited again outside, and sat down on the couch in a vegitative stance.    My mind, however, was far from vegitative.  As with any intense experience, every little nuance of reality that is most often times taken for granted becomes a pounding cessation that yields either wonderous pleasure, or a sense of doom and terror.  I honestly, at the time, felt I was going to die.  I kept telling Jeff I wish I hadn\'t taken all fifteen, but just ten.  The marijuana did not help at all, but I love the marijuana high and smoked some more anyway.  The visuals became more crystal, and my head still felt as if it were holding on by bare tendons before releasing and floating off into space.    I must have entered my mind and lost touch with reality an hour later, because time was lost in the oblivion of space, which I discovered was only an illusion.  The consordium of reality was but a vague incantation amidst a myriad of spiraling, gyrating colors not as intense as a psyilocybin, or DMT, but nonetheless captivating.    Catatonia, holding a cigarette that has long since burned out.  I come to, realized that I was in an alternate dimension of reality, in which I was visiting a higher plane of evolution.  A jump FORWARD through evolution to where time and space yielded a pocket, so to speak, specifically designed to house the three of us in the experience.  Since I was the only one tripping, I really wasn\'t aware that Jeff and and his girlfriend were talking to me worriedly.    \'Dude, he\'s knows where he is!\' Callie argued with Jeff, \'Look, he\'s awake, he\'s moving around, he\'s alright\'  She then proceeded to ask me if I was alright.    \'Yeah,\' I responded as if totally sober and everything was perfect.  \'I know exactly where I am.\'  I chuckled after that.  Of course, in the sober reality they thought I was coming down from my trip and realized where I was.  In all actuality, however, I was in another dimension, and they were as well, and we all were amazed that we were smart enough to realize where we were and not freak out about it.  It was interesting, and after awhile the intensity of the alternate reality become unbearable, and I drifted out of it directly into my mind.    This is the peak of the experience. This is what is described in Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas as, \'the two-and a half hours or so of catatonic despair.\'  He was describing an acid dose, but LSA is similiar to acid.  The dose I took could be compared to a moderate acid dose, and I very-well achieved the same plane of consciousness.    I was literally strung out in an infinite stretch of pain, clutching myself and floating through the abyss.  The pain was similar to that of a complete body charlie-horse, where the muscles and the nerves were told by my brain to go into duress.  Now I don\'t think any damage was being done, but at the time of the experience I was concentrating on moving into the pleasant field of space.  I achieved, and a negative thought or fear invaded the perfection and sent my spiraling back into the pain.  It was a back and forth sequence in my mind, and my thoughts were trying so hard to attain the true meaning of everything important, throwing aside everything worldly because it no longer mattered.    When I came to, I realized I was in my room.  It was dark, everyone was asleep.  The walls were still moving, but the hallucinations were only minor.  My thoughts were still zig-zagging in terror, believing the room was Hell, and I had died, and I would spend eternity locked in my mind to balance out pain and pleasure and control chaos.  For a moment I was happy, because it would mean I could create my own realities.  I could design life and become a God of sorts.    I was crying when I realized what had happened, and I was crying with joy with I opened the door and saw the night-world was still there, and life was still happening.  The beauty was more phantasmagoric than any psychedelic experienced, and I realized that that was the meaning behind the journey.  To realize that you cannot become god, because the intricacies are so infinitely expanding that it resembles Chaos, although it is not.  It is a governable reality through inherent laws given by the Universal Mind.  Our thoughts, I realized, are dicated by our state of mind and our view of everything.  Really, the only thing that mattered was the beauty of life, and its infinite complexity.    To feel the rhythm, to  Feel inspired, to  Feel connected,  Enough to step aside and weep like a widow.  To feel inspired, to fathom the power, to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on a spiral out.  (Tool, Lateralis)"
23512,A Rapturous Reverie,Mellifera,"Mar 7, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Methamphetamine,"As an experienced psychonaut, I am not a virgin to psychedelics or to most other drugs for that matter. After having around 500+ separate journeys with LSD, I still never tire of each unique and wonderful experience. Now, around this part of the country, drugs like meth are easily accessible for anyone with a half a mind to find them, but getting some good dose has become almost next to impossible these days. For this reason, I began to experiment around with a few alternative psychedelics, one of them being H.B. Woodrose seeds.    Now, I had tried Woodrose seeds before, ranging anywhere from 2 to 50 seeds, and had very little success with them. I never felt anything more than some nausea, fatigue, and a tease of what I wanted. Regardless, one weekend I decided to give them yet another shot, and my girl and I each tried 10 seeds while we happened to be up on some pretty good gogo. The seeds where first scraped with a razor to remove any fuzz, crushed, soaked in 4oz of distilled water for one hour, strained through a coffee filter, and then taken orally around 8:00pm.     Also, please allow me to clarify; I probably use far less methamphetamine then that of most users. Any habitual or daily use might go through a gram in about 2 weeks between two people, with the average \'bump\' about 5mg in size. I believe in moderation and have sensitivity to stimulants; moreover, I really just want to express that taking massive amounts of speed isn\'t required to receive positive results.    The typical upset stomach set in about 30 minutes after ingestion, my girl spent the next 20 min paying homage to the porcelain god. I have found that if I don\'t move, watch a movie, and just sit still for those first couple of hours, that I can avoid losing my stomach while the initial symptoms pass.    About 3 hours into our trip, we noticed a remarkable difference from the times before. Everything was more intense with vibrant hues of orange, deep lines of blue, and very similar to that of an LSD trip. Yet unlike LSD, all hints of paranoia and suspicion were completely absent. My mind was that of a majestic oak, soaring high in a luscious valley, completely surrounded by every natural element in perfect harmony.     She and I spoke of many things, about feelings and emotions, and not about the overly psychoanalytic brainteasers of your typical acid trip. This time, we were completely relaxed in both mind and body, yet had this incredible energy that could be felt strongly emanating from the both of us.    Some 10 hours passed, of which we primarily spent in the bedroom. With daylight streaming in and birds chirping loudly outside our window, we decided to rest for a while. Sleep came easy and about 4 hours passed, at which time we got up feeling well rested, very happy, slightly hungry, and still tripping just a little.    After a mild breakfast at about 2:30 in the afternoon, and I say mild because no tweaker wants to eat anything after staying up all night, we did a small line and then smoked another equal amount in a glass bowl. Immediately after I exhaled my hit, everything around me began to swirl and undulate. Colors rushed back into the room, floral designs on the wallpaper started to grow, and I could hardly believe my eyes.    What I thought was going to be a 3 or 4-hour event turned out to be a 3-day long spiritual journey like I had never experienced before in all of my life. If I where to just sleep a little and not do any more meth, it would go right away; otherwise, the effects lingered on for an indefinite amount of time.    Now, the visuals were never quite as strong as LSD, but came very very close on the first night. After that evening, they were still there but almost transparent if your attention or focus was elsewhere; however, as soon as you looked for them, they would begin to move and shift around just to let you know that the world was alive and smiling with you. The residual feeling of well-being and strong sense of self lasted well over a month; in fact, I can feel it still.    I realize this post has become rather lengthy, so I\'ll wrap it up. Now, since I\'m only an under-grad chem student, I have neither the knowledge nor experience to adequately explain why the LSA seemed to increase in peak and duration simply by using a little methamphetamine. All I know do is that it seems to work as a catalyst, made for a very beautiful and healing experience, and was just lot of damn fun.    So, I hope this information helps someone else have experiences that are as good or better than my own. But please, know your limits, know your environment, and bee safe!"
28700,Ultimate Compassion,Triana,"Feb 12, 2007",H.B.  Woodrose,"Andrew and I drive to south west pennsylvania to go camping. We find a really nice shelter and I start scraping off the fuzzy outer layer of the seeds at about noon.  I had fasted for over 24 hours before I ate the 10 seeds and then for some odd reason decided to eat some pretzels and a half a sandwich along with some orange juice right afterwards. About 20 minutes later I really regret eating and start to feel ill.    We start walking to the shelter to go hang out and lie down.  I\'m feeling worse and worse. For maybe about 45 minutes or so I try again and again unsuccesfully to throw up. I try smoking some pot to ease my stomach but just the look of it sickens me.  After a while of laying down the nauseau passes and I discover that the best way for my body is crouched over on my knees with my head face down in a sort of bowing position.    I start having a hard time seeing becuase my pupils are HUGE so I just close my eyes and unconciously start singing/mumbling/chanting made up words.  I can feel my heart speeding up along with my breathing in an expecting sort of way.  I\'m starting to see lots of different light patterns and images inside of my eyes.    I realize I have to pee so I get up with my eyes still closed and walk to the outhouse.  It\'s only about 60 or 70 feet and as soon as I get in the light I\'m blind and lightheaded.  I start to feel really dizzy but just keep pushing on to the outhouse.  I get in, pee, and when I open the door I\'m so disorientated from the light and standing up I feel a blackout coming on.  My legs turn rubbery and I crumble to the ground in the same position as before.    Andrew comes to the rescue and helps me walk some 30 feet before I crumble again.  I\'m finally back in the shelter where I stay crounched in my bowing position.  I stay in this position for hours, rocking back and forth, singing and mumbling sounds/words while beautiful,patterns of eyes, hands, etc. All rotated and divided around a circle of light.  Alot of the images have to do with India.  I see a womens eyes with her face hidden behind a veil looking deeply into me.  I see the god (Shiva?), the being with multiple arms flowing.    I thought about ultimate and everlasting compassion, forgivness.  I felt sin and understood jesus and asked the earth the cleanse me.  I felt shameful and unworthy and dirty thinking about my carelessness in everything from not cleaning the dishes as best as I could possibly do, to arguing with my parents when I was younger, to not spending enough time with my mother, to accidently pointing at a man as he walked by our shelter becuase I couldn\'t really make him out.    Balance. I understood so clearly how little we all relaly need in terms of food, clothing, material possesions, everything.  I felt the importance of nutritious food.  Organic, vegan, hot dishes prepared with love and care and time. I felt the weight of a chinese saying I read once that said when you eat your stomach should be half filled with food, a quarter with water, and a quater with air.  I understood adam and eve and overcomsumption and how it will be the downfall of man.  I felt suffering and understood to some degree how much of it there is and how much people inflict it upon themselves and onto others.    I don\'t understand it and yet I feel it.  I thought about all the people that I care about and have come in contact with over the past couple of years.  Those who have helped me along my lifes\' travels and those who have misunderstood.  I realized that its all meant to be and if an action or word seems negative it is the same as if it were positive.    I felt the need for change and thought about all the things I can do to help.  I have no money really, but what I do have I want to give.  I want to clean the dishes and the counters and vacuum and HELP.  I want to make cards and mail them to unexpecting people.  I want to thank everyone for being themselves. And I want to bow and thank the earth before I eat.  I want to sit in my mothers arms and thank her for bearing me into this world.  I want to worship my true mother, Earth, the one that knows me best, but let my human mother know that she is holy and deserves respect, love, understanding.  I want to sit at my fathers feet and forgive him and be forgiven.  And above all I want to strive for everlasting compassion for this is what must come first.      So before dark at probably around 6, andrew and I try to leave.  I walk about 10 feet before I feel the blackness and rush back to the shelter.  About 2 hours later I try standing up again and think I can make the half mile walk to the car in the rain.  We get to the car and sit curled up under a blanket listening to the most wonderful music and meditating.  It\'s making such wonderful reactions inside my body and I rediscover my love for it.    We get in at around 10 pm and I sit trying to talk to Andrew\'s parents with my eyes still huge.  I keep blanking out while asking them questions and I start to feel dizzy and lightheaded from the kitched light so I go lie down.      That night I dreamed that a very mean lady lit my cello on fire and when I dropped it lightly by accident, it shattered and I awoke with tears in my eyes."
29406,Poisoned,anonymous,"Jan 23, 2007","Wormwood (extract), H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Alcohol","Let me start of by saying me and everyone involved are very experienced drug users. Verterans to say the least.  We have done many drugs such as mushrooms, pot, alcohol, coke, exstacy, and our very dear, long lost friend LSD, among others.  This night would prove to be unlike many others.    The other night me and some friends decided to chill at K\'s house.  We planned on it being just another friday night getting *ucked up.  Things went good for most of the night.    6:00pm:  We arrive at K\'s house, and go right upstairs to smoke.  During this time, we pulled out everything we would have for the night, minus the Buttershots and Baileys Irish Cream, which we planned on getting.  K had some cough medacine, but only he is crazy enough to drink that shit 24/7.  He began taking that.  Also, K made some absinthe extract out of wormwood. As N put the absinthe into doses and then into capsules, Kenny G pulled out the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds that he got today.  I have taken HBW seeds a few times and had good results, comparable to lsd.  Why not take some again?  Me, K, and Kenny G began scraping off the coating on the seeds so no one gets sick.  Kenny G\'s plan was to extract the seeds, but he had a lot so we decided to test them.    7:00:  It was a bitch, a real son of a bitch, but we finally got the seeds done.  We then crushed up the seeds in a pepper grinder and put them in capsules.  Me, Kenny G, and K each had 10 seeds.  We dropped them by 7:30, and began waiting for the effects.  I felt no nausea which I usually do.  I got real sick last time, then tripped harder than ever.  I was hoping for the same trip.      8:30:  Me, Kenny G, K, N, Seano, and Young Bumble all chilled downstairs after smoking some bowls.  Me and Kenny G weren\'t tripping hard yet.  Everyone was pretty messed up, each on different substances or combinations.    9:00:  I get the call from The Man who says he will get us the liqs.  We pick him up and bring him to the store.  When he came out, he just shook his head because he had too much liqour, for us and him.  We then went back to K\'s.    9:30:  Starting to see some trails, pixles, and just a generally good feeling of an oncoming psychedelic.  I love it.  We go up to K\'s room where we sat down to smoke, drink, and watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force, one of the best showers ever.    11:30:  Me, K, and Kenny G are definitly tripping now.  I\'m not tripping hard, but nice.  I could definitly feel the lsd like substance, and everything felt better due to the wormwood.  We hung around the basement.  B and M showed up for a while, then left.  After they left, me, K, Kenny G, and N decided to take another dose of 5 seeds.  K scraped all the seeds, and even after he spilled the bong water on them, we crushed them up, capped them, and swallowed.  Now we wait again.    12:30:  Kenny G and Bumble went outside to smoke a big ass weed stem.  I don\'t know why, but this kind of thing is normal for my friends. I joined them, as I am one of them.  Soon the others came outside, and we began to smoke a few bowls.    1:00:  Things were going good until now.  We stood outside smoking.  I was standing in front of the car, and began to feel something strange. It began in my stomach.  I figured the other 5 seeds were beginning to kick in.  All of the sudden, I began to trip harder than I have have in my life.   Everything got blurry and my head filled up with pressure.  I went to lean against the car, and to tell my friends something was wrong, but I coudnt talk.  Then I fell.    Before I knew it, things were coming back to me.  I was laying in the driveway looking straight ahead with my face on the ground.  I was trying to understand if I was alive or dead, as I left like I was in a graveyard, and I didn\'t have a clue.  I heard a voice say, are you ok?  I gave a thumbs up, as I could hear my friends, but needed to gather my senses.  My friends told me I fell to the ground and shook for about 5 seconds, as if I were having a seizure.  Seano said my eyes were rolling in my head.  Kenny G grabbed my arm and then slapped me, trying to see if I was ok, and thats when I came back.  I still didn\'t feel well so they got a chair and I sat down.    All of the sudden it started happening again.  I told them I needed to go inside.  As kenny G brough me in, my head filled with a pressure-like feeling, things got blurry, and all I could hear was a very loud ringing noise.  I thought my head was going to explode.  I sat down and knew I was about to be sick, so Kenny G got me a bag, and I got sick.  I threw up the rest of the seeds I\'m pretty sure.  It was horrible, but after I got sick, I felt much better.  I relaxed, and everyone sat around, shocked.  No one really knew what or why it happened, but it did.      3:30:  Bumble soon left, and after that we then went up to K\'s room where we layed down and eventually went to sleep.    Conclusion:  This night was one of the scariest, most fucked up nights of my life, and from what my friends said, it was scary for them too.  I\'m not sure what or why this happened to me.  I have done many drugs, and I have never had any problems.  I\'m not on any medications and I am generally in a good mood.  I have been only smoking and drinking for the last 2 months.  I didn\'t drink much tonight either.  I have a feeling that these seeds are very dangerous.  Everything was fine until I took more, then when they should have been kicking in, things got bad.    There are many debates on whether the seeds can be toxic, and I truely believe they are.  It\'s not going to happen to me.  Thats how I\'ve always felt.  But after living through this night, I now know anything is possible.  It\'s happened to others, and now me.  I will never touch these seeds again.  Anything can happen at any given time.

Woodrose, Calamus, Ginseng & Kava","Medication: None    Mindset/Setting:  I\'m currently nearing the end of a gap year and to fill the endless bordom I decided to find and experiment with as many LEGAL drugs as possible.  I\'m fairly new to any kind of \'drug like\' experience so I was more than a little nervous not knowing what to expect.  I bought one 6 cap. pack of premixed herbs, I waited for a day when no one would be in the house for the majority of the day.    Preperation:  I\'d been reading several accounts of other people\'s experiences in \'The Entheogen Review\' and a common factor was meditation of one form or another.  One method in particular had stuck with me; laying on a comfortable surface (my bed) I placed my hands on my chest, closed my eyes and proceeded to take long, slow, deep breaths - smiling with each in-breath and relaxing as completely as possible with each out-breath.  While doing so I questioned my reasoning behind what I was about to do, came up with sound answers, strengthened my resolve and calmed myself down. I continued until I felt ready.    The Experience    Brief Note: My sleep paterns are a little strange at the moment, I wake up at ~3:00pm and go to bed at ~6:00am.    5:00pm - I sat down in my room and took the first 2 gelcapsules (the packet instructs staggering the dose by leaving 30-40 mins between each 2 caps in order to avoid nausea).  I\'m pretty impatient so I decided to go for a long walk, and after the requisite 30 mins I hadn\'t noticed any changes in perseption so I stopped to take the next dose.    5:30pm - It was when I stopped moving that the initial effects made themselves clear.  Looking at the grassy countryside that surrounded me I was surprised to notice that the world was slightly effervescent.  All colours were mildly enhanced.  When still and staring at stationary objects (trees, etc.) they would change in perspective, appearing to zoom in and out ever so slightly.  Down went the next 2 caps. as I returned home.  I had little to do so I sat down to watch some T.V.    6:00pm - Before I took the last dose I got up from my bed to check my pupils.  F**K they were wide!!  I\'m not kidding when I say there was equal to or less than 1mm of iris left to see.  I wondered briefly if I could damage them like this, but downed the last 2 caps. and realised that I felt quite light on my feet, almost floaty.  I was feeling quite giggly now, laughing at laughing had me rolling around on my bed for several minutes, several times.  I also noticed that EVERYTHING felt soft and tingly and nice, as if your incased in a fluffy bubble.    7:00pm - I think this must have been the peak because I was really euphoric and giggly.  I wandered around outside a fair bit just marveling at the beauty of mother-earth and her myriad facets.  I had several focused thoughts about the nature of mankind, my place in the comos and such.  This platau lasted a pleasurable 3 hours and then very gradually began to taper off.    5:30am - Up until now I\'d felt full of energy but then, almost as 5:30 ticked over, I felt extreamly tired.  I did the necessary\'s and climbed into bed where I quickly fell asleep.      After Effects    None really, other than having one of the best dreams EVER the next morning.  I got out of bed almost instantly (this almost NEVER happens to me) and felt happy and revitalised.  Every time I gaze at some object of nature I\'m still struck by its glory and begin to ponder our existence.    Conclusion    It\'s hard to describe what it actually feels like. It makes you want to have deep and meaningfull thoughts about Life, the Universe, and Everything.  The only real bad thing is that, although everything feels nice and soft and tingly, anything sexual seems a bit boring.  I\'m a horny teenager but even my desires languished and faltered.  All in all a good experience I will try again."
49938,Not at All What I Expected,Vanderbilt Spaceman,"Jan 5, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Alcohol,"Well, I had read a lot about all sorts of different highs in the vaults, but I was more interested in the natural highs. I feel that they are a more appropriate medium through which to come into closer contact with nature and our earth. Being that there are so many different substances to try, my friend Tyler pointed me in the right direction...right to h.b. woodrose. He suggested that these curious little creatures had the most potential to trip, and based on our collaborative research, I agreed.     I ordered some seeds from an online vendor and I decided that 10 seeds would be a good strong dose. I invited my hall mate to join in and he was quick to accept the invitation. We dropped some Dramamine to help us cope with nausea, which more or less worked wel enough. We slowly chewed the seeds one at a time and washed them down with water. They didn\'t taste too bad, nothing like the morning glory concoction or the amanita tea that I have had before. After consumption I had another Dramamine, bringing that total to 3.    After that we just sat around with some music playing, namely the Doors, to encourage our cerebral expansion. Very quickly after eating the seeds, maybe about 30 minutes later, we began to feel strange. The strange sensation quickly became extreme lethargy, coupled with a creeping, lingering nausea. We did not want to even move, and I even found talking to be exhausting. We decided to part ways until the effects came on more strongly, so I went to lie down and nap for a few minutes.    Needless to say, I felt too much discomfort to sleep, so I just sat there for about 30 minutes. I also want to note that about the time that we started to feel tired we also felt really cold. I wasn\'t shivering, but it felt like my internal temperature had decreased dramatically. After my \'nap\' I got out of bed to check out the effects. I wasn\'t hallucinating unfortunately, but when I looked in the mirror, my pupils said that I was. They took up my entire eye. I walked around and was surprised that I was no longer tired or sick, but that these feelings were replaced by an intense rush of happiness and warmth. I was amazed that the seeds would have that kind of effect after all I have read about the discomfort lasting for the whole trip.    I journeyed into the bathroom to stare at the mirror, an activity I had found very fun while on shrooms. It had the same effect, making everything seem sharp and pronounced. I stared directly into my eyes and got lost somewhere in my gaze. It actually freaked me out because I had on this stone cold face. I laughed it off and left the bathroom.     I stumbled to the adjoining room to see how my partner in crime was doing, and he was up playing guitar looking very happy. I could tell from across the room that he was also very dilated. We talked about the feeling and were both impressed. He said he did not believe that such strong feelings of happiness would follow the sick feling of ealier. We talked and kept saying how wierd the feeling was, unlike any other substance we have previously used. Our conversation was coherent, but we couldn\'t string together any normal thoughts. I felt really giddy and funny, like I had smoked some bud for the first time in a long time. But I didn\'t feel high like bud, rather, I felt a rush of energy throughout my body.     I decided to take a walk around campus because we have a lot of big tress and sidewalks. Right off the back, I was aware of how clear my vision was and how crisp and clean everything appeared. I liked the new perspective I got while looking around, it was as if I was walking around campus for the first itme. I saw everything in a larger, broader view, taking into view a lot more at a time than I had previously. It was fun to sit down and listen to the distant conversations of students walking around, their voices echoing and wavering. Walking around, my feet felt light, but my steps were heavy and stompy at times. But to contradict that, they also very light and walking up hills didn\'t seem taxing at all.     I returned back to my dorm to start another activity. I encountered my friend and told him about my walk. He was hungry, and I too noticed some munchies. I had some cheez its and they were delicious. We then decided to drink to see if that would heighten the experience. Indeed it did. We had countless \'kindergarteners,\' the so called creation of apple juice and cheap vodka. We noticed that the drinks went down very smooth, even slimy feeling. And after each gulp, the alcohol would smack us in the face with a nice buzz. It was a lot easier to feel the drink taking effect than usual. We decided it would be fun to watch some Seinfeld, season 6, which we did- for several hours. We watched at least 10 episodes back to back. At first, the seeds had impaired my ability to follow along like I had always been able to. This is like earlier when I was not able to string together any ideas, my flow of thought being very choppy and sporadic.     It had been about three hours since we took the seeds, and we were definitely peaking at this point. I don\'t know if the alcohol was overriding the lsa, but the intense buzz from the woodrose wore off quickly and I was more or less back to my old self. But still, I was definitely under the influence of the seeds which now acted as a multiplier of the vodka. It was the best drunk feeling ever. I was coherent the whole time, but noticeably drunk. That is, until I passed out around 2 a.m. or so.     I woke up today with no side effects from the seeds, just a little hung over from the alcohol. All in all, the experience was definitely worth it. Next time I think I will double to dosage to 20 seeds and see if I have a more psychedelic, visionary experience that I was shooting for the first time. Nonetheless, I had a great time as soon as the nausea and lethargy wore off after about an hour of coming on. I would recommend the Dramamine because I was borderline to where I could almost puke. Other than that, according to my experience, a good dose to start would be 10, and then you can shoot on up from there."
25205,The Angel and the Tree,Johnny Z.,"Dec 1, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"I thought that my first experience with LSA would be a comfortable night of tripping in a friend\'s dorm- it was only going to be my second trip ever, my first being on DXM a few months prior- and so after R and I had eaten some H.B. Woodrose seeds (her four and I nine) and I was suddenly informed we were going to a punk rock show, I was somewhat nervous.  We had been waiting for weeks to eat these seeds, waiting for a time when everything would be right- a place to be, a quiet night in.  And now that was in jeopardy, after already ingesting the stuff.  Although I hear tell that LSA takes about two hours to start going, I was already feeling weird an half hour after ingestion- a sort of warmness all through my body, almost to the point of discomfort, but not quite.  Soon our friend K arrived, and off we were, apparently, me starting to lose reality just a small bit.  I wasn\'t experiencing anything particular; everything just sort of struck my fancy as we walked to the venue.  I would notice it was cold, and this would be terrifingly funny, and I would laugh.  I don\'t know how much of this was the LSA and how much of it was my nerves, but it wasn\'t a sinister feeling- just one of somewhat confusion.    We arrived at the show, and apparently R or K had paid for me because I sort of just waltzed in like I owned the joint, partially because the basic functions of hand-money-to-bouncer seemed inscrutable to me.  Once in the club, I started to get downright scared.  The sarcasm and anger of the music was completely and utterly wrong for me to be hearing while on this drug; every shrieked vocal grated on the tranquility I was very nearly failing to feel, and every bass note hit me in the gut like a championship boxer who had just learned his car had been totalled and had some things to say on the finer points of the situation.    In a word, I was in rough shape.  My mind was reeling, and my stomach was joining it; I rushed to the toilet, certain I was going to be sick.  I wasn\'t, despite my best efforts to force it just to get it over with, but in the bathroom, where the music was still assaulting me, I decided enough was enough- I could not take it anymore.  This was not the place to be doing what I was doing, the atmosphere was too hostile, too crowded, too lacking of quiet.  I tried to explain this to R and K, but they just told me to stop acting so weird.  Leaving a bewildered R and K behind me, I made my way to the quieter world outside.    And . . . it was more than quiet.  It was silent.  While I had been desperately attempting to avoid sonic death inside, a near blizzard had come to town, and the streets and sidewalks of the city had been deserted to make way for the just-audible whisper of falling snow- piles of it.  This is when my trip really started hitting me full-on . . . the snow was beautiful.  Every bit of terror I had felt in the club washed away instantly, so that while I was still in front of the door, I could barely remember even being inside; all there was, was the snow-covered street.  It glittered and danced and fell on my face; it was beautiful.  I decided I wanted to hug my friend E, and set off to do so.    On my way to E\'s dorm I got it in my head that I was an angel, and this was a terribly nice feeling, but I got so wrapped up in the moment that I started to believe I had wings- could feel them flapping- and I could have sworn I saw the snow fluttering in the air currents caused by my wings.  It still feels, in memory, like I almost started floating off without warning that night- on wings made of dream and frost.      Soon I arrived at E\'s, gave her the hug I wanted to give her, and went off to my friend S\'s room, only S wasn\'t home, so I hung out with his roommate B instead.  He was most interested in my state, being a person who does not ingest drugs but who is infinitely fascinated by people who do, and so he asked a lot of questions which I had the hardest time answering- my language skills had deteriorated so that I talked a hell of a lot but said very little.  He put on the movie Half-Baked, which I watched with interest, not because I had one clue what was going on, but because things on the screen were doing impossible things, such as commercials carrying over into the movie so that Dave Chappelle was trying to sell me Charmin and such nonsense.  I tried to explain this confusion to B, but to no avail.  He went to bed and I sat down and watched the news, which made even less sense than Half-Baked, so I turned it all off and leaned against a window.    Outside their window was a very tall pine tree, the branches of which brushed up against the glass.  Leaning there, looking down at the snow (reflecting a sickly orange light), I started to see through the eyes of the tree.  I became the tree- felt my age and my history- saw things through my multi-faceted tree eyes.  This was fine and dandy, until I looked down- and saw not the ground but some sort of vast mirror, a reflection of my tree-self . . . only it dawned on me that this wasn\'t a reflection, it was my root-system- I could see every part of me, as if the ground wasn\'t there.  This seemed utterly profound to me, so much so that I nearly reeled, and had to disengage from the window.      For awhile I played with blankets and remote controls, mostly tasting them.  Eventually I started to come down and went home and to bed, where I slept a peaceful, if unnoteworthy, sleep."
29815,The \'Anti-Drug\' Drug,The Rhubarb Kid,"Nov 27, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"OK, so this is how it is:    I have been a major chemical brother for many years now.  I have experienced all the up\'s and (come)downs, the \'highs\' and the lows possible from MDMA, Coke, Ketamin, and so on.    And, to be honest with you, I am getting bored.  Sick of it all, and not just in the head.    For the past few months I have stripped my desire to get high down to its barest essentials - not just \'how\', but WHY am I getting high?  What exactly am I searching for by creating these experiences?  And what am I running away from?    With all this in mind, the stage was set for my first foray into the magical world of Hawiian Baby Woodrose.    So, yesterday morning, after hours of internet \'research\', I decided to go out and purchase some top quality HBWS from my local head shop.  With an air of breathless expectancy I waited until the house was empty; five of the seeds soaking in hot tap water.  This was after I had scraped all of the \'fuzz\' off the outside of the seeds, and thoroughly rinsed them.    After two hours I removed the seeds from the glass they were standing in, took a deep breath (metaphorically and physically!) and placed the first of the seeds in my mouth.  I chewed my way through all five, waiting hesitantly for the bitter, acrid taste I had read so much about.  And....    Nothing.  I have to admit I was pretty annoyed - nobody wants a bad taste in their mouth, but I didn\'t expect them to taste just like paper, or soil.  Great - I thought - I\'ve been sold dud seeds.      Nothing like a high dose of disappointment to leave a bad taste in your mouth - or not as the case may be.  And nothing like eating a pack of placebo-type seeds to give you a little pain in the stomach.  Well, actually rather a large pain.  In fact (looking at my watch) 20 minutes in and I\'m already gonna have to hurl.  Dammit !!    And I did.  The small bowl of rice and vegetables I had permitted myself for lunch 7 hours earlier had obviously not been yet digested.  Nor would it ever be, now, except maybe by some fish in the Pacific Ocean.  I flushed the chain and instantly felt better.    Tons better.  Tons and tons better.  Eons better.  In fact (check watch) only 30 minutes in I feel like I\'m \'coming up\' on a couple of E\'s.    Five minutes later I\'m awash with empathy, ecstasy and all that other good stuff.  I feel as though the war is over.  However bad it gets, it can get better.  There is no greater gift than life, and I am blessed with it (against all odds and overdoses!!)    Pretty soon the confusion kicks in, buts it\'s not confusion in a messy whats-my-name-where-am-I sense.  Just a warm, fuzzy, blur around the edges.  A floating-down-the-river-and-loving-it kind of confusion.  Yeah - I thought - I\'m THERE!!  But I was not \'there\', not yet, not by a long way!!    One hour into the proceedings I decide to write.  My script starts off regular, and after a few paragraphs becomes a giant, flowing scrawl. The very act of moving the pen over the paper feels like a miracle.  I am HERE - I can do this.  All is sacred.    For the first time in my life I can know experientially the things that I have always known only conceptually and intellectually.  We are one - really really - as a rock is connected to the earth and thus to everything else indirectly, so am I connected to All.  And on top of that, I AM All.  All is Me.  I am made up of the same stuff as the stars, and it is fucking beautiful.  I am beautiful.  Full of beauty.    At this point I lower the tone slightly by getting a major attack of the munchies.  I write a note to my housemate explaining that I am borrowing some cheese from the fridge for a sandwich.  As I enter the kitchen another friend arrives home, with cheese and tomato pizza, and offers me half.  I am ecstatic at this and run around shouting \'Ask and ye shall receive!!  Thank you, Universe!!\'  Moreover, I was amazed to discover that, unlike with chemical stimulants, I could eat just fine.  This was really turning out to be MY sort of high!!    It was at about this time (two hours in) that I began to trip.  About three years ago I had done acid a few times, and mushrooms a lot, so this feeling was nothing new.  Wallpaper patterns began to swirl, the carpet took on the appearance of a \'magic eye\' picture, and everything became an experiment for new tactile experiences.    I can\'t really remember very much about this \'exploratory\' stage except that it was FUN!!  Nowhere near as visual as acid, but much more enjoyable due to the lack of unwanted side effects.    An hour later the other guys I live with came home and stuck on a video.  I chatted with them for an hour, watched the video (some comedy, I don\'t remember what) and went to bed.    I fell asleep immediately, slept a good few hours, and woke up feeling refreshed and energised.    I no longer feel the need to take chemicals (for how long, who knows?!) and I feel that I respect myself and this Mother Earth of ours about a billion times more than before.    Thank you HBWS, and thank you God for providing me with this experience.    Here\'s to many more!!    Namaste,    The Rhubarb Kid."
54090,Death Can Do Better than This,Zeus,"Jun 24, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"Yesterday I woke up, took a piss looked at myself in the mirror and contemplated whether or not I should shave. Its a process, something that I just didnt want to do. It began just like any normal day in Wales. Wales is part of the UK. Not England, but part of the UK. Geography is key.     But I woke up today feeling as if it would be the same as any other day in my location. A couple of friends came over, S from Spain and G from France. Usually on a typical day like today we would sit on the couch in my coffin sized living room and play video games, surf the TV maybe put in a movie if we really had time to waste. But I managed to persuade them to come with me to Cardiff.     I really didnt know why I wanted to go. It was Easter holiday over here, weed is pretty scarce when there is no one here. I just bought a beautiful pipe maybe about a month ago and it was just sitting on the top of my desk. I knew I wanted to put it to use with god knows\x85just anything to keep my sanity in tact. There is this shop in Cardiff. They usually stock the obscure shit: Various incense holders, tapestries, \x91happy pills. The guy behind the counter looks like took a few piercing to the face and survived. That type of place. Ive been here before. Its great actually. I bought my pipe from here not to mention a lot of equipment for my hookah. Good stuff. I knew they had Salvia Divniorum something that I tried about a year ago but really had no effect (everyone else in the room that night was literally drooling. Disgusting times). But its Saturday, I had nothing better to do so I got a small tube of Salvia 6x for 14.99 pounds.     For some reason after I chose the salvia I kept on looking in that same revolving display case. Herbal ecstasy rolled by but I simply wasnt interested, been there done that. Just as I was about to walk to the counter a little packet of black seeds caught my eye. On the packet it read \x91Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. Jesus Christ, I just read about this stuff the night before, or maybe it was the night before last. But it was fresh on my mind. I was contemplating on ordering a packet of the seeds over the internet but there it was sitting comfortably between the salvia and a glass pipe. I knew I had to snatch it up.    I was initially interested in Hawaiian Baby Woodrose because I was informed that it was one of the few naturally occurring LSA sources in nature. I also remember Terence McKenna briefly talking about it in one of his lectures. S, Gulliherm and I decided that it would be a great day to see Scary Movie 4 and\x85well\x85it would be the best time to try out these newly acquired seeds. I mean, it is Saturday. Sitting in the lobby waiting for the film to start the guy behind the counter told me that its best to crush the seeds up, place the remains in my mouth with a large swig of orange juice and swish in the roof of my mouth for some time until the orange juice coats everything. I pulled the seeds out and looked for a way to crush these bad boys.     I tried taking the bottom of my large bottle of orange juice to crush them on the table. No go. I gave them to G, maybe he could figure out something. This is the same guy who just walks into peoples houses and steals coats and jackets, he will definitely find a way. He wrapped the seeds up in a white bag, placed them in a glass ashtray, then placed the ashtray beneath his chair so that the end of his chair leg was directly on top of the seeds which were on top of the ash tray. Two hard surfaces, in theory it should work and after a few hops on his chair it did work. I opened the bag up and the seeds were crushed aside from a few that I could probably just crush up with my teeth. Dropped the seeds in my mouth, downed it with orange juice and I was off.     Sitting in the dark theatre watching Scary Movie 4 I knew something physiologically was different. My arms felt different, the way I moved my head seemed a bit sluggish. The movie was funny, I tried to look at my two friends to try to read their reactions but I couldnt. I dont know if it was just simply too dark or my perception was off but I couldnt tell if they were enjoying the movie or not. Suddenly, I realized that if I didnt laugh or show some verbal emotion that they would think that Im going off on the deep end. I belted a few quite laughs here and there just to reinsure them that I was still \x91normal and not really feeling anything (although by this time I was). The movie was over, it was time to get up, when I sprung to my feet I noticed a sharp pain on the inside of both my legs, a pain that would linger on and off the entire night.     I also seemed to have misplaced my Salvia tube. This was the last thing I wanted to do, search on the floors of a dirty theatre in near dark for a drug in a black tube. It felt like things hit rock bottom, there we were searching on hands and knees for the tube. It was no where to be found, we have forgotten where we sat so we were literally crawling over two rows of seats combing them for a black plastic tube. I patted my pockets and found the salvia, the search was over. Just another induced paranoia by a substance, its happened before so I was not that shaken by it.     When we go out the theatre and in the open air, thats when I knew something was going on. When I was inside the theatre, the only thing I wanted to do was puke, I felt miserable. It was as if Ive taken a shot of cyanide and was dealing with the after effects. It was hell on my body. Sort of like the nauseating feeling that I get right before I feel the effect of mushrooms only a lot more gut wrenching. But I was outside now and nearly all those physical effects subsidized. I was walking out in the open completely fucked out of my mind to say the least. The ground felt like silly puddy being stretched out in the air and I was somehow walking on it.     Every footstep sunk my foot deeper in the earth, when I would rise out of that footstep, I would pick up my other foot and place it on the concrete feeling that same disoriented motion. It was like walking on a giant bed cushion suspended from the peaks of two mountains. Ive been to Cardiff before, Ive been in Wales for nearly two years but I had no idea where the hell I was. I looked around and it felt alien to me, as if I were in that movie hostel and just arrived in Eastern Europe. The people looked different, they were dressed different, I looked for my two friends and they were off in the distance going another direction, I had to catch up with them.     They told me that we were going to the train station to go home so I just happily agreed. They had a hold on society, they werent altered like me. If I could just manage to stick with these guys until I found some since of environmental familiarity I could do just fine. As I was walking with them I saw this corner store. I blindly ran across the street in order to get a lotto ticket. Why? I have no idea. The chances of me feeling like this was one in a million, so maybe I could transcend my existence on a piece of lotto paper and manipulate something. Its important to first tell you by this point it felt like I had my finger on the button of time, space and probability, I could just flip a switch and win this thing. It wasnt that hard, people won the lottery all the time. They must have tapped into the same realm that I was in and saw the numbers out of some type of unknown consciousness that existence in some secluded place.     I got two tickets, the minimum I could place on my bank card was 2 pounds. I gave the cashier the card, it didnt work because it was American. Ok, hold up\x85Ill use the cash point I told her. It was right behind me, it couldnt have been that hard to operate. I place my card in there, the machine told me that it doesnt accept my type of card. I knew this was going to be hard. I was lost in more ways than one. I looked around the shop for my friends, they were in the back looking at the wines. S must have somehow read my expression for help, she came over. I explained the situation to her, I looked around the convenience store while I was talking, every single person was staring at me, from the cashier to the emu girl and her boyfriend. Something was going on. I stopped talking. Maybe I said too much. Maybe I said too little. G came to my aid and gave me 2 pounds. I had to end this. I got the tickets and walked out of the place.     When we were on the train, the visuals really hit me. I thought I was going blind. Lemonade crystal shards appeared out the corner of my eyes and soon filled the top, left and right of my vision. I call them lemonade crystal shards because thats the best way I could describe them, if I had the ability to pick them out of my vision, mix them in water with sugar and stir them up, they would undoubtedly taste like country time lemonade. I knew this to be true. I tried closing my eyes to diminish the effects, but every time I would open then they would still be there. I tried listening to my I-pod but that was just a distraction and a nuisance by this time. I was to the point of complete mental confusion. We got off the train, G and S told me they were going to get a kebab and asked if I wanted food. Food? What? Right now? Thoughts were just going through my head. G must have sensed my confusion, he sort of told S or mentioned to her that they should just do it by themselves. G really took the words right of my mouth.     I knew I had to get home. If I was caught on the streets when this substance fully hit me it would be devastating. My mental state was comparable to the calm before the earthquake. I felt the Richter scale twitching up a little bit. It was Time/Space vs. Me. The distance to get to my house factored in with the time it would take me to get there really bugged me out. I had to get somewhere fast. I called up my friend D, a guy always known to have buds and the latest PS2 games at his house. Weve been wrecked before, he could relate. I muttered something on the phone to him that eventually permitted me to enter his house which was a hop, skip and jump away from the train station. When I walked through the door I was thoroughly articulate for some reason, maybe I wasnt but it really felt like I was. I walk up to his room and see that its in a state of disarray, boxes of food on floor, shit randomly broken and scattered throughout the room, cigarette ash on his Technics, pop-ups splattered all over his computer. I was at home.     There was this other guy there, I forgot his name but he looked like he had nothing better to do than to just sit and watch D play the new Godfather game. I sat back on his bed, buzzed, buzzed buzzed out of my head. D looked over and said I \x91looked pretty wrecked or something to that extent. How did these people know where I was? Did I somehow give off this aura that let everyone knew \x91Wait, that guy is completely on another level. I really tried not to think about it, so I answered with a \x91Yeah, man. I told him what happened before, about the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. He was impressed. I also told him about the Salvia that I had sitting in my right pocket. G and S knocked on Ds door, still I believe those guys had some sort of psychic connection that tapped directly into my cerebral. They wanted to know how I was doing, I was alright\x85really I was. They went back to my house to eat the kebab, watch TV and play videogames as if this were one of those typical days. But I knew it wasnt.    D, in one of his ingenious moments, decided to roll up a Cognac blunt filled to the brim with Londons finest weed. How could I say no? A blunt is always the rudder in a ship lost at sea. The light tower for the weary sailor. We quickly puffed it, the taste was honey to my lips. Amongst his various porno pop-ups, he threw on a World Industries skate video that just blew my mind. The music was good, the skating was good, I was in the right frame of mind. Im trying to recollect everything that happened at the house but it seemed like life was just moving at 16 frames per second. Things would happen, I didnt full understand why they happened but I was happy that they happened. It let me knew that there was an underlying structure to this world, although I couldnt fully understand it, it was there waiting for me when I got off this mind zinging trip. Suddenly, I remembered G and S. I told them I was going to get them so we can go back to Ds house to smoke. Although Ds house was incredibly comfortable and welcoming I had to tread out in the wilderness of the city. I quickly insured him that I would be back by leaving my salvia on his bed. Off I went.    I opened Ds door and saw outside. Wales in a strange place, even stranger when Im under the influence of a hallucinogenic compound like Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. The city or maybe it would be better if I say \x91urban structures are cleverly mixed with the wilderness. A train bridge might be host to some amazing foliage. Vines may wrap around stone bricks. Walls might be covered in moss. Its a truly strange place. I closed the door and knew I had to get out there and make it happen.     Now what happened next, I still have no clue. Im not sure whether it was anxiety or\x85I dont know. Maybe it was one of those \x91bad trips that I hear about on the internet. However, what happened has gone down in the history of most amazing mental trips Ive ever had in my life. If I would have done this maybe a few years ago when I was knew to the hallucinogenic scene I would have either committed myself to a institution, tried to commit suicide (yes, it was that strong) or just cower in the corner like an infant. As I was making the trip back to my house, my mind was just filled with archetypes of life and death. A lot of beliefs were created in my head, developed as truths and placed to rest inside my mind. This was the most stressful time of the experience.     I believed that everyone on this earth was just on one hallucinogenic trip and weve tripped so hard that we accept this new altered state of mind on \x91earth as the norm. I knew this to be true and I somehow was coming down from that trip, I was one of the few people in the world that understood this secret. As I was thinking about this, a sudden pang of terror filled my body. What if this is one big hallucinogenic trip and when I finally \x91come down my hallucinogenic body perishes? I die. Wow\x85wait am I dying right now? Is that why Im learning this information? It seemed like these were not my thoughts, but the thoughts of some ancient game that has been played since the beginning of time.     As I walked under the train bridge cars seemed to zoom past me. This is when I really had to catch myself. I thought by throwing myself in front of a car, I could end this trip and big done with this imaginary place called \x91earth and start living my life on whatever plane of existence I was on. No, I cant do it\x85are you serious T? Did you just understand what went through your mind? This is unacceptable. The computer-like reflex of my mind took a hold. But then I thought, maybe Im thinking about all this because my death is actually imminent.     One of these cars will surely hit me. What am I doing under this damn bridge? Its a death trap! I just wanted to belt at the top of my lungs \x91Get me out of here!.  But I knew that I was the only person that could take me from that place. The rest of the voyage home was just filled with \x91Death \x91Death \x91Life \x91Death. I honestly could not think about anything else. If I could make it home, then I would surely end this trip and die at home. The signs were there, all around me. Ive been thinking about the process of death for nearly two months prior to this trip.     Maybe my thoughts about death were just some type of pre-preparation for my last days on earth. Some type of hyper-lubrication to prepare my soul for its departure from its body. Hell, maybe I was dead and I was just walking the earth as a ghost. None of these cars paid attention to me like all those other people throughout the day. If this was death than it sure isnt different from life. Bummer. What a let down. All these religious wars, killings, holy beliefs for this?!? Its not even different, give me a break, this is incredibly dull. Death you can do better than that. Ah well, I knew that I needed to make it home dead or alive\x85or whatever current state I was in. I had the sensation of moving and I could take that sensation to my front door as long as I didnt stop so thats what I kept doing.     I opened my door and saw G and S playing Puzzle Kombat on Xbox. It was incredibly peaceful. Maybe I wasnt dead at all. Things were still operating as they should have always been. These two people are carrying on with their lives in peace, in the comfort of my house. I sat down and just watched the play for a little bit. Things started to make sense again. It was warm inside. The white walls in my living room soothed my mind. I thought to myself \x91Boy was I in a bad state just minutes ago. It was time for us to make our way back to Ds house, it felt like I just hit the peak of the trip and was on the come down. As we were walking, G and S kept on talking about \x91death and dying. How did they know! How could they have possibly have known! I was alone inside my head thinking about this, they surely couldnt have penetrated my thoughts from such a long distance.     I knew these guys had psychic powers, but they were good\x85really good. It was as if they were just teasing the cohesion in my spirit. Taunting me to just trip the fuck out or remain cool and collective. I went with the later. We got to Ds house in an amazingly short time, the walk wasnt nearly as bad as I had prepared for. We all sat down, a really awkward but cool ambiance filled the room. We all sat down and just waited without saying much. G watched as D played the Godfather game. S was looking at the other guy in the room at this point, he was completely stoned off his rocker and just mumbling to himself in the corner. And I thought I was in a different world.     We finally managed to organize a small smoke session consisting of my pipe, Ds weed and my Salvia Divinorum that was surprisingly still on Ds bed. He packed a moderate bowl and it went around the room. Everyone had a nice toke. I couldnt read everyone in the room properly, I could tell that D and I were out of this world. The guy sitting in the chair talking to himself, well\x85hes a guy sitting in a chair talking to himself that pretty much sums it up. As far as G and S, they looked stoned, I dont really know they looked like themselves which could still technically mean that they were stoned. Who knows? I was definitely on the comedown and inside I was jumping up and down with exhilaration, I nearly survived all this\x85there is still some time but Ive done alright so far.     D threw on this sketch comedy with two English guys doing absurd stuff. It was funny, strange but definitely funny. We decided to go to this local pub to fulfill the rest of the night, I only felt stoned by now, it was a familiar feeling. The pub was nearly empty aside from a few bonehead Welsh guys. It was one of those, alright lets find a table, sit down, drink this beer and pretend like we know that the hell is going on inside this place.    The night pretty much ended with me in Ds house playing PS2. The other two went home. And I eventually followed their lead after a small bowl of bed and one last round at Godfather. The walk back home was normal.    I have a new found respect for HBW. Ive taken many \x91herbal pseudo-psychedelics and found them to be dull and devoid of content, this was definitely not one of them. Would I take it again? Well not anytime soon thats for sure and surely anywhere but the comforts of my own home and some nice melodic tunes. This trip was uneasy and rough, like an unexpected uppercut. But Im still here, and thats all that matters."
50493,Not for Me,Milo,"May 23, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"While looking on an internet site for herbal ecstasy, I came across these seeds which were described as having LSD like effects. I\'ve had lots of experience with stimulants such as MDMA, Cocaine etc, but no hallucinogenic psychoactives such as LSD or mushrooms. I\'ve allways been interested in trying LSD but was scared off by possiblility of a bad trip. These seeds however were described as being much milder and a much shorter trip.    They arrived within 2 days and I decided to do them that weekend. After reading the experiences on erowid I decide to take 6 seeds (the minimum amount of seeds which still gave positive results) using cold water extraction to try and avoid nausea. I removed the husk, mashed the seeds up in a mortar and pestle, placed them in a small bottle and half filled it with water then left it for 3 hours, shaking the bottle occasionally.    I then strained the mixture, ate a small amount of the pulp (1 or 2 seeds) and threw the rest away, leaving me with a muddy brown liquid. It smelled woody, like my hands would smell when I was 10 years old and had been out climbing trees and playing in the woods. I mixed it with some fruit juice and and drank it over a period of half an hour on an empty stomach(2:00pm). It tasted quite nice, like blackcurrent ice tea. I\'d say my mindset was pretty neutral but I was quite nervous.    As I finished the drink I started to feel the effects, I felt slightly drunk but with a different sort of intoxification, I played on the computer for a bit but started to feel tired and not with it, so I lay on the sofa and watched TV. My girlfriend came in at that point and started making lots of noise which annoyed me excessively.    Over the next 2 and a half hours (T + 1:00 - T + 3:30) The feelings intensified, I felt more drunk more tired and I also started to get flu like symtoms such as diziness, and it felt like I had a hangover. Nausea began to build and I went to the tiolet to see if I could be sick. I had one heave but nothing came out, as soon as I did that however I started to feel much better, relieving the nausea.    I was now at the peak (T + 4:00) and while most of the effects were physical, I did notice some mental effects. There were some quite strong breathing of surfaces, strong light and shade changes and some sparkling of objects, I also had a couple of giggling fits, no increase in thought patterns though.    It may have been quite pleasant had it not been for the physical effects which were still too unpleasant. I lay on the sofa looking out of the window for a while at the leafless branches of a large tree swaying in a strong breeze which looked quite nice.    After this, all the effects described above started to fade gradually untill about T + 6:30 when I felt ok to eat someting. by the time I went to bed at T + 8:30 I felt totally normal, a little giggly still maybe, and I slept normally.    Summary- I feel that the dosage I had was probably too low, and that there is probably a threshold I need to go over in order to trip properly and get rid of the nausea. However I will probably not be trying these again. A stronger dose will probably enable me to trip properly but I would still need to encounter the physical effects I had initially and stronger, in order to get to that point, which i\'m not prepared to do as they were just to unpleasant.    Overall the effect was one of being food poisened, or of being extremely ill, rather than being nicely intoxicated."
24778,Test Run,Stynkfish,"Mar 23, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"Experiences (basis for report):  (Substance=Number of Times Used/Dosage) MJ=10x,Ecstasy=100+x,Coke=10x8b,LSD=1x,Magic Mushrooms=2x,Speed=2x,Alcohol=Gallons!    Setup:  I have a pretty clean system right now  meaning I have only drunk the occasional beer over the last year.  I have been itching to have an experience for a while now but dont know anyone in the loop so I decided I would try something more available.  After a few days of heavy research, I came to the conclusion that Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds offered the most EFFECT to EASE OF USE to EASE OF ACQUIREMENT ratio of anything out there.  I bought a bunch and convinced my fianc to try them with me  but we can never seem to get our timing right  so I made a trial run of 3 seeds that I have outlined in this report.    Preparation:  1. Ordered online  2. I took what I refer to as the bark off of them, scraped all the hairs off of them, and quickly singed each side of them over a candle using tweezers, ensuring all hairs were gone  3. Put them in a plastic Ziploc bag and smashed them with a hammer  4. Emptied Ziploc bag into a water bottle with about 4oz of water in it and let sit for 30 minutes, shaking every 10 minutes or so  5. Gulped it all down  seed fragments and water    Experience:  I drank the water and seeds at 5pm and then did some chores to keep busy.  I had eaten at about 2:30pm so I figured it would take at least an hour to hit - if it did at all from the low dose.  The hour passed  felt nothing.  At 6:15-6:30 I felt a little hungry and started to feel the slightest compression in my head  similar to a buzz coming on from alcohol  I did not eat.  The compression gradually built over the next 30 minutes at which time I felt quite relaxed  reminiscent of taking a large mushroom dose (but to a lesser extent) and some mild cramping in my stomach  almost like the hard seed shells were having a difficult time passing though the stomach.      At this point (Start Time(T) + 2 hours) I was lying on the couch watching an HBO sports show about why European basketball players are better then US players which seemed unusually interesting to me (not a basketball fan)  I would say more so the imagery then the words.  At T+2:30 I forced myself up and made a quesadilla because I was REALLY hungry  my motor skills were reduced  touched the hot pan twice and didnt care much (no blisters so I didnt get burned).  I lied back down on the couch and decided to find the cartoon channel.  The search was very tedious  I just wanted to watch something.  Once I found it, I ate the quesadilla which tasted good  but didnt satisfy my hunger  and the cramping continued.  The cartoon channel was fun to watch (did I mention I have a 61 TV that helps out a lot?)  the colors were vibrant and seemed more three dimensional then normal and I contemplated how cartoon animators must be into hallucinogens  otherwise how else could they be driven to make cartoons?  There was a Trix commercial with computer generated backgrounds that was really interesting to me and made me smile pretty big.  This feeling is reminiscent of watching a video called Beyond the Minds Eye while on LSD (again, to a lesser degree)  for some reason, the smoothness of motion and perfection in color associated with computer generated animation really grabs my fascination.      I tried two times to shut the TV off to see where my mind goes, but I was left wondering and pretty bored  mostly I would say it was impatience on my part.  I turned the TV back on and watched cartoons some more  and then switched to the Star Wars EP II DVD which was also fun but I was starting to think about my fianc coming home from work (T+4 Hours).  Once she showed up, I had a very mild buzz going but could easily converse with her and she was none the wiser.  I went to bed early (T+5.5 hours) and slept better then I have in a week.  I woke up and have been able to function today just fine  no hangover or motivation issues.    Conclusion/Summary:  The experience was like a mild LSD trip with some stomach cramping.  Overall it was fun but I would like a more intense experience.  Given the fact that I only took 3 seeds, I am encouraged by the taking of about 8.  I think I will also try soaking the seed particles in water for 12 hours or so before hand and filtering out the seeds, drinking only the water.  Hopefully this will get ride of the darn cramps! (dont get me wrong, they were not unbearable  BUT I had a reduced dose (could get worse) and would simply prefer not to have them at all).    If this gets published to the Erowid site, I will also publish my full dose experience."
28154,Amazonia\'s Revenge,Prometheus,"Feb 20, 2006",B. caapi & H.B. Woodrose,"I had some really pleasant and beautiful trips on woodrose seeds in the last few months (every time between 10-20 seeds, depending on the occasion). My experiences so far were also easy to handle (if I compare it to LSD or shrooms), so I decided in my holidays to try a LSA/MAOI combination to boost the trip and make it more \'interesting\'...    I placed about 10g of dried Banisteria caapi plant material in a pot, added some water (0,8 - 1,0 litre) and the juice of a grapefruit (I had no lemons left) to acidify the water. The mixture boiled for 45 min, until only 1/2 cup of liquid was left. After cooling for about 15 min and straining, I drank the stuff at 1:00pm...YUK! Definitely among my Top 10 of REALLY bad tasting drinks.     In the meantime I took 15 H.B. Woodrose seeds, scraped of the furry coating and ground them in a spice mill. The resulting powder was put in capsules, which I intended to take after the caapi effects had started (to be sure, that the caapi had any effects at all and to verify, that the extraction was somewhat successful).    Then I did some easy work in the garden and after 1/2 hour the caapi effects started with a mildly stoned, pleasant feeling, like smoking some weed. At 2:00pm this feeling got some more intense, I also saw some visual distortions, nothing special but interesting. With this light-headed and encouraging feeling I ingested the LSA-capsules together with 1/5 teaspoon of ginger-powder to avoid the nausea (it really works, at least for me).    At 2:30pm the trip started with the typical dizzyness/tiredness. So I smoked some weed while sitting in the sun in my garden (it was a beautiful, warm summer\'s day) and waited... 1 hour later I began to realize that I have heavily underestimated the power of the two plants, it already was very intense and my mind was pure chaos (and the trip was just about to start :-(    For calming down I played something relaxing on my guitar for a few minutes. This surprisingly turned the trip into another direction, I now felt VERY happy and the plants in the garden were of such beauty which I\'ve never seen before. But this lasted not very long: I suddenly remembered that a few good friends of mine wanted to come for a visit this afternoon (playing cards, talking and stuff, nothing special). I didn\'t want my friends to know about my experiments, so I thought of calling and telling them that I feel very sick and I want to be alone today (instead of telling them the truth, that I have ruined this meeting by taking \'drugs\'). This thought made me feel so ashamed of myself because I haven\'t seen some of them for a long time and we were all looking forward to this meeting. I decided that I would be able to manage the situation and try to make the best out of it (as mentioned, a bright sunny day, good friends, some weed: the perfect setting, I thought)...    My friends arrived and for no real reason but my twisted mind I felt some sort of terrible guiltiness accompanied by paranoia and fear. I tried to hide it and react as normal as I could. But on the other hand it wouldn\'t have been a problem to tell them the whole story and that I\'m feeling very anxious. I simply wanted to keep the illusion alive that everything is alright and I\'m enjoying the afternoon. The next 2 hours were pure horror! I felt attacked by everyone, I thought they would make fun out of me. The only wish I had was to come down and back to reality. I also felt like vomiting but this was the last thing I wanted my friends to wittness this day.  As the evening came and my friends had left, I felt much better again, and happy that the trip was nearly over.    I can\'t really decribe in detail what I felt and what the cause for my paranoia was, but I know, that there was no real reason. This experience was definitely a big warning! Never underestimate the power of this mythical plants and the unpredictable consequences of MAOI-interaction!    As you can see my much-to-heavy-trip ruined a wonderful day and made me panic and paranoid for absolutely no reason but the fear of my illusions. The caapi seemed to amplify the LSA-trip very much, too much for me. This day showed my clearly: those plants are no toys, especially not with this dosage and combination."
19644,Hell,Vinzko P.,"Nov 23, 2005",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"This is a new experience for me. It was undoubtedly one of the most god-awful, terrifying experiences of my life.    On Thanksgiving Night, 2002, My brother, my cousin and I decided to party it up while my father was not home. We decided to ingest some of the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds my brother got from an internet company. It was my first time with any sort of hallucinogen, I had only taken weed, speed and liquor before that. We began the night by taking the seeds. My brother took 8, Cousin took 6, and I took 14. We then smoked two bowls of really dense, really excellent blueberry chronic. While we were smoking, we were sucking on the seeds to soften them before we chewed and swallowed them. We did so and were feeling good and giddy, etc.. more talkative and awake than usual.     About a half hour later we go downstairs to eat some leftovers and watch Predator on the big screen. Everything was alright. I could definitely feel something else working in my body. About 20 minutes later, we paused the movie to go upstairs and smoke some more. We smoked about 4 or 5 more bowls of herb, and after I had finished smoking and was sitting in the circle with my brother and cousin, everything came crashing down. I thought about something, and then completely lost it. Immediately I sat up and said, \'HOLY FUCK... I HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP, RIGHT NOW!!\' I knew in my mind that there was no slumber to be had. I knew I was in the shit now... I knew everything was going to get worse before it got better. Something entirely negative washed over my head, but I can\'t explain it. I knew if I could just try and sleep, maybe I could get out of it. As my brother was asking what was wrong, I closed my eyes to see if there were any visuals. Sure enough, my vision became section into 16x16 blocks and these blocks swirled into whirlpools, which thus turned into worms. Not fun. I was in the grips of what was to be the most hellish and horrifying experience of my life.     I jumped up from the circle and rushed out the door and very carefully traversed the stairway into the house. I stepped into the fully lighted house, into the kitchen, and things started toppling in towards and away from me, I felt stretched out and very discombobulated. I couldn\'t control myself. My cousin and my brother came in and were yelling at me to clean up the kitchen. So I started saying, \'Not possible, I\'m REALLY fucked right now.. I think I\'m having a bad trip.\' And they didn\'t care or whatever. So I got really forcefully angry and started yelling, telling them to back the fuck away from me because I was damaged. I remember trying to walk down my 20 foot hallway and it felt like no matter how fast I tried to walk, the hallway kept getting longer and longer and more skewed and disjointed. When I reached my room, I turned on the light and plopped on my bed on my side. Things were happening to me... I don\'t know what. I was seeing so many horrible things, so many disturbances. I felt completely detached from my body. I couldn\'t feel my hands. A million and a half thoughts were drilling through my mind, which I had felt I had lost.     I threw over the covers and jumped onto my computer to try to document what I was feeling on an aphex twin messageboard. My typing was completely unreadable except for key words like \'hell\', \'ruined\', and \'destroyed.\' These words described me quite nicely. When I tried to type, my hands became see though and the only way I could guide my fingers to the keys was the fact that each key would turn pink as I ran my finger over it. I typed as I thought, my shoulders and arms not longer existed, as if my thoughts were transferred to the keyboard from my eyes, letter by letter.     I finally went into some sort of calm. Things slowed down a bit, I could focus more... things were still hellish and now everything was turning into the 16x16 swirls again.     Then I went almost numb. I could no longer see or feel. I was trapped. I felt like commiting suicide for the first time in my life. I am an atheist, but I was praying for my life. I was sincerely praying for everything to work out because at that point in the trip, there was only two feelings or thoughts or emotions I could experience.  Positive and Negative, Love and Hate, Good and Evil, White and Black, etc. when I touched something, it registered as a plus or a minus. I then searched for a razor because I thought I needed to end my life. I couldn\'t move. So I started thinking I would never recover, that I would be a vegetable or a raving psychotic.     I started to think about good things, like Disneyland, and I started to feel a little better, so I got up and walked into the living room, I lay down on the couch on my side, and watched Predator with my brother and my cousin. They weren\'t tripping badly, so they were my babysitters. They told me positive things, and one would think watching Predator would suck when tripping badly, but it ruled... it was friggin awesome. I couldn\'t make anything out on the screen but a bunch of plants and green with no depth of field. I needed to arrange a cushion in front of my eyes for some reason to block the screen at some point because I wanted to rest my eyes but I didn\'t dare close them. So I just stared at this couch cushion and the green halo of the TV. Then I came down so quick.... I just felt then I had smoked some more weed. I felt so pleasureable... So excellent after coming down.     I might do it again... but defintely less than 6 and I won\'t smoke weed with it either. I was trying to overcompensate for my body-size, taking the 14 of them.. but I guess the mind is basically the same size in everyone...     Stay safe"
19679,Just Let Go,If I were Kyle,"Oct 14, 2005","H.B. Woodrose, Hash, Alcohol & Cigarettes","This was quite a surprising trip indeed, nothing like any other indoles (tryptamines & otherwise) that I\'ve tried. I\'d tried these little gems of wonder once beforehand (w/pot that time as well) with four other people and watched them transform into vapid trip-zombies at doses of 2-4 seeds. I\'d found that quite enjoyable, so I did it again.    The evening was predicted to be dull: A Saturday night at home with no money and very few cigarettes, in the company of my arch-nemesis - British primetime TV. ooooooohh! If ever there was a need for someone to take drugs to escape biredom and futility, this\'d be it. The entire night\'s supposed activities changed with a quick phone call from a friend - a Teetotaller at that. I sat and talked for a while, and guzzled down five or six of the tough little buggers (I got it confused with seven - one of them pulled out a filling and I swallowed it. c\'est la vie.) I was scheduled to meet \'Mr. H\' at a local snooker club in around 40 minutes - just enough time for it to kick, so I sat and watched the best of England\'s \'essential\' selection at this juncture.    Teedly tee. Waiting\'s boring. The simpsons grew more interesting and I felt a heavy, subduing sensation onset around three minutes before I had to go. Excellent timing.  Just before I left, another little nugget of goodness in the form of our browny friend Mr. Hash (please distingush this from Mr.H who was supposed to be picking me up), so I quickly rolled a pathetic little doobie and left with him.    At the snooker club, things started to intensify, and rapidly: I could hardly walk (I pounded a couple of drinks whilst catching up with people) and I felt very disoriented, perhaps a little confused. It made me a lot more attentive in conversation, and probably turned me into a bit of an arse as well (nb: at the end of the evening I was told I\'d started stealing ice cubes from people\'s drinks and throwing them at heads), but I was also feeling sick... If a lightbulb could\'ve materialised above my head, it would have, and \'!ping!\' what\'s that little tubular papery thingy in my pocket? Ah yes! I forgot all about that. I sauntered towards the toilet, knocking a few people on the way, noting how a few of the more perceptive people noticed how dilated my pupils were. A guy turned round (I\'d never met him before) and said \'ah - at least there\'s someone else in here on that stuff as well\', so I made a sly gesture and walked to the toilet.  After the most heavenly piss I\'d ever purged from my bladder, I sat in the cubicle and sparked up the J. just a little, I thought (another side note - it\'s not a good idea to do this generally, as you\'ll end up busted by the club\'s (or whatever\'s) management, but luckily enough the cubicle was enclosed with air conditioning and a window - talk about luxuries!).     Bob Marley came up on the jukebox outside. Good choice, sir! so I tugged down half the J quickly and staggered back to where my friends were sitting, and just laid back, enjoying the people\'s games, the music and the conversation. I talked to a few people in-depth and learned some new things. I discussed my love for physics & computers, and of course Radiohead (\'The bends\' was on the jukebox at present, and the song had never made as much sense).    Towards the end of the evening, I became progressively more lucid - probably due to the drinks. I lay in the back of Mr. H\'s car and enjoyed the tingling sensation in my limbs, the leftover taste from the drinks in my mouth, lots of cigarettes (I\'d bet I could stash away twenty glasses from the club that night and the success earned me 20 Marlboro. I guess lucky pennies are everywhere if you look for them in the dirt). Visuals were muck more detailed and \'fractal than a regular acid trip - I\'d say a mixture of the dxm \'play-doh\' effect I sometimes get and the expansive, complex, oscillating visuals that mushrooms give me, with a spicy dash of that creative edge LSD gives me) I could construct weird creatures made of gelatin, steam and staplers in my head, I could add crab claws and tendrilled eyes. I found that by just letting go, dropping all my self-expectations and desires towards a single creative goal, that my mind was free to mould that abstract putty any which way it wanted. And man, did it ever want to splash out on that!    After apologising to Mr. H, a good friend of mine, by the way, for being a jerk all evening and just plain freaking a few people out (funny, that. some people who haven\'t experienced this kind of thing before didn\'t really know the depth to which these trips extend if you really focus on them. They didn\'t even humour my weird conversations or philosophical rhetoric. One lady even came close to slapping me when I suggested she re-orientated her diet so it would only contain tripe! ah, well. some people take longer than others to learn the diverse, flexible nature of perception & consciousness, or the imagination for that matter... anyways, i\'m digressing from the story). When I finally lumbered up to my bedroom, I wrote a little poem that summarises what I learned. Drum-roll, please:    I moved along to CA where the beach will beckon me,  with ham and all the other things whose company brings glee.  We sat around the campfire, and ham had been the host,  when I replied with fervour that ham looked like she\'d seen a ghost.    (chorus. oh yeah, it\'s a song)  She said..  You know daddy, when you gotta get straight  ham is the center to which we all relate  the glazing\'s diff\'rent by all eyes  but it always comes out a pig just the same, just the same  I said it cometh out a pig, just the sa-ame.    I bit into a clove, or a peppercorn perhaps  the piggy little piece of flesh fell on out my gawking trap.  But ham told me not to worry, \'cause she said \'it\'s just the way  when the taste is just the same but the coating\'s really lame.\'    (chorus)    When I said that ham was right  she\'d just roll her eyes and bob.  her little pinkish boobies I coud rob I coud rob.  But that boundary\'s a crossin\' where the lights are flashing red.  You\'ll find your new religion when you are supposed to see,  but just try to remember that your sight is really me.    That poem probably seems quite stupid, yes, but it\'s a good analogy of how I felt that evening. Before that little Rubicon of thought, those insights I\'d ignored when I was less than rational, I thought, basically, that I was flawless compared to everyone else. I\'d be the vessel through which divine arrogance flows. But I realised that if I was attentive to the people around me, not just my friends, I could feel their pain, their sensitivities, their nuances. They became so much more faceted and complex than the assumptions I\'d made about them, and I was much less diminutive towards them as a result. I guess, you could say in a nutshell, that I learned humility and empathy, and I now regard them as two of the most essential tenets of anyone\'s philosophy on life.    Over and out..."
18484,Odd,anonymous,"Aug 8, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"After smoking pot often and trying other euphoric experiences like ecstacy I was eager to try tripping. I had tried asked around for shrooms or acid in my area, but found myself out of luck unless I wanted to buy blotters or ounces. I researched online some and read about morning glories and hawaiin baby woodrose. The HBWR seeds seemed quite appealing, with many users reporting a \'happy\' but not necessarily psychedelic experience 100% of the time. I thought the seeds would be worth a try.  First I went to a local drug store and bought some Dramamine (nauseau relief) to cure the expected sick feeling when eating HBWR. I took the dramamine dosage a half hour before I ate the seeds. The fun began when I began grinding seeds at about 1:10 pm. After 1 seed being ground to a fine powder, I was too eager to try this new experience so I began chewing them thoroughly. By 2:00 pm I had eaten 11 seeds. Which were all chewed very well to assure that my body would digest them well. After I consumed all my seeds, and my friend with me also at 11, but quicker than I had, we decided to go for a nature walk. Within about 15 minutes we both agreed we felt energetic, and odd, but in a happy way. The feeling had felt like the \'creeping up\' period when people take ecstacy, or acid (so I\'m told).  After about an hour of eating my seeds I felt disappointed. My friend began to see trails, color changes, and I had still just felt \'creeping up\'. So we decided to hang out and watch T.V. over at his house. Over the next hour, which had been up to three hours since consuming, I felt sick, like motion sickness. I took another Dramamine since I only took a half dosage the first time.   As my sickness and uneasy feeling grew, so did my aggrevation. I found T.V. to be incredibly annoying while my friend found it incredibly intriguing.  As it reached about 3 hours after my consumption time, I began to feel delightful and happy. I would just sit and laugh for minutes on end because of my harmonious feeling. It was quite enjoyable. After we both definetely agreed that HBWR seeds had a \'cool effect\', we thought we\'d go for a ride. We drove around town running errands.  [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]  I began to feel very odd inside my head. Trees and the sun were fun too look at, my perception of size seemed quite distorted during this time also. After walking around in public places we began to notice that people were looking at us very odd. Strange looks were being giving by people outside, driving by, etc. We looked at each others eyes and our pupils had gotten gigantic. I looked like a cartoon character almost. Anyone would have noticed my pupils were far too large for the daytime.   Anyways, the delightfully odd trip went on for another hour or two. Then my friend began to become very paranoid and freaked out. He had begun to worried that the drug had messed him up for good, he was worried about going into pyschosis, or having a bi-polar disorder. He was worried and wanted to go home, So I went to hang out with some other friends since I was still tripping and didnt want to go home. My new companion for the night and I drove to his house quick so he could change clothes from work. I stayed in his car and chilled. I felt completely disconnected to thought, or from will to think, talk, or do anything really. As I sat in driveway outside, lights began to move around and the size of the driveway was changing frequently, like morphing. My friends car then began to also morph into strange but similar looking shapes. I was still enjoying my trip. Then my friend, who was not tripping, wanted to go out and socialize/party, as would anyone on a saturday night. We went over to a hot chicks house to chill. But as more and more people began to come around me, I felt very awkward. The awkwardness grew as the need progressed, and more people were about me. Conversations with friends were odd, because I couldn\'t think of anything to say, since I still felt so awkward.   As the night moved on, now nearly 8 hours from my 11 seeds consumption, I felt worried if this awkward feeling of thoughtlessness and confusion would ever leave. I too thought that I would end up in psychosis like my friend had worried earlier. The night lengthened out as did the awkward feeling. I went home and chilled in my bed, which was then about 12 hours after I had eaten the seeds. I stared at the wall and notice it was melting, and it began to take on vivid colors and morph. I was still trippping. I just decided for myself it would be best if I got sleep and maybe the awkward trip would leave by the next morning. And it did, I felt less awkward in the morning, however everything still looks kinda \'odd\'. That concludes my experiences with HBWR. My trip was a trip for myself inside my mind, which helped my contemplate lots of issues in my life. I thought the trip helped a lot, though it was a bit worrysome. :-D"
10647,Blew My Mind,Insatiable,"Jul 26, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"I have never done any psychoactive compounds before, mostly just an occasional beer or some marijuana every once in a while, but I soon got to reading about HBWR seeds and became a little curious. I decided on purchasing some \x91Hawaiian variety which they said were \x91potent! The 25 seeds came in the mail and I separated 13 seeds and began to clean them. First I scraped of the seed coat, then the fuzzy layer as best as I could (That contains the stuff that breaks down into cyanide in your body and some people say it what causes the most nausea).    I ground the seeds in a coffee grinder and set them in some distilled water (Ive heard that tap water that has chlorine in it can break down the LSA molecules) and a bit of ginger to help relieve nausea. I let that sit in a dark place for 24 hours, stirring occasionally. I ate a bowl of Cheerios for breakfast, no lunch and no dinner, but Id have some water throughout the day.  At 4 pm the next day I took one Dramamine, then at 5:00 I drank the odd tasting mixture slowly, including the seed remnants. It didnt taste bad, but it definitely was a bit bitter and plant like.    After I drank it I went to my friends house, A, who was there with his girlfriend B. At about 5:30, I noticed that I would seem to stare at ordinary things for a while for no apparent reason and start thinking about them, like how they work or how have I used them before. It was almost like a very low marijuana thought rush. A said that my pupils seemed to be a bit big, but not really that big yet. I proceeded to drink some old flat sprite which seem to quell the slight nausea pangs that I had. They werent severe, but it seemed like I could feel a small rock of something in my stomach.    By 6 I could definitely feel something. I would stare at something and the outer edges of my vision seemed to swirl around it, not really a lot, but I could tell. My pupils were getting very big by now, noticeably big B said. Another of our friends came over now, called C. We all got into As car at that point and went to a CD store, which was about 45 minutes away cause C had to trade in some of his old CDs. When we got in the car something definitely hit me, I was in the back seat and the street lights were casting shadows on the seat back in front of me.    It seemed like the shadows were a play of my life, including the future. I saw myself graduate, get married, have kids and so on, and I felt very happy and relaxed, as everything I saw was good. I didnt feel any panic or anxiety rush that a lot of people say they experience on psychedelics the first item they use them. We soon passed onto the highway and all the lights, street and car, turned into octopuses of energy (Thats the best way I can describe it). Each light seemed to have its own personal pattern of tentacles, some were long and stringy, others short and fat.    By 6:30, I could feel the vasoconstriction effect of the other alkaloids kicking in. My skin was a bit dry and my legs felt tingly and heavy, like a very large buildup of lactic acid after running for a while. I took my shoe of and B said my foot was pale, but not blue or anything I should be worried about yet. (I did this throughout the night and each time it was fine.)    At around 7:00 we got to the store. Between 7:00 and 7:30 was what I call the bad part of the trip. My eyes were jumping out of their sockets and I had no iris left. I guess its true what they say about \x91eyes like piss holes in the snow. It hurt to walk yet I felt it necessary to pace around the store looking at nothing. I seemed to be outside of the stores reality, a ghost simply observing human life. The nausea had grown steadily, and it seemed like the world that was beyond ten feet from me started to twist into a spiral. I would see passing shapes whenever I blinked. They would either be one of two things: A blue diamond with a triangle in each corner or a five by five row of green star-like objects. Suddenly, intense paranoia and fear crept up on me from out of nowhere. I had to get out of there, so I went outside and puked up the seed mess. (Not a good idea to do in the crowded parking lot of a strip mall type deal.) After this I regained my composure, cleaned my mouth out with some water, and went back in.    At 7:30 it seemed like a door had opened somewhere and I could feel something better then happiness and contentment together. Everything was bright and colorful, and I could mold reality into things its not. I looked at my face in the mirror and I could make myself look old or young at will. On the ride home I saw in almost a deep meditative state thinking about everything in my life that I had done and how I should go on. The pain in my legs was severe, but it didnt matter. The car headlight were giving me some nice streaks to look at too.    At 8:00 we were back in As house. He has this carpet with rows of stars on them and I was completely mesmerized by how I could manipulate them. I would focus on the start, then lose focus and focus on something that seemed not to be there and the start would start spinning. The walls, covered by magazine cutouts and band posters, turned almost to a thick liquid, and colors started running together. This is about the peak I believe. At some point during my trance at the carpet and walls some weird feeling came to me, something completely new that I had never felt before. I cant really describe it but its almost a transcendent feeling, and everything felt exactly as it should.    At 8:30 I left As house with C and we met up with D and E, who were driving around looking for something to do. It was then I noticed how bright everything was. It almost seemed to have gotten brighter since I left As house, after it was already dark. C said they could drink at his house, so we found F, who had a carload of people who we gave money to and went to try and get beer. While they were doing that I had an incredible craving for food so we went to Wendys. Me and D went in to get the food and I realized how bad I still was. The walls were like curtains and would sway back and forth. It seemed like everything that had a normal geometry to it turned into some moving breathing entity. The corridor to the bathroom which was actually only five feet long seemed more like fifty and twisted down to a \x91very tiny door.    At 9:00 we were driving around still, and I was perfectly content eating my five chicken nuggets. They seem to taste perfect, and each time I took a bite I was happy, like a kid who is given a piece of candy for a good job. As D drove around, I continued to think and became very happy and serene. We found out they couldnt get the beer so I went home and laid on my bed till about 12:00 just looking at my \x91white walls which were covered by overlays of intricate blue designs. I thought about everything and seem to come to a realization about everything I thought about. I cant imagine a time when I was more content then that. I felt like I had been given some sort of knowledge that no one else knew and it was my job to make sure that I used what I learned to better my life.     I had some of the most lucid dreams that night too. I could control what I did and interact how I wanted to, and I realized it was a dream too. When I woke up, I could still see some faint overlays on my wall, and If I stared hard enough I could distort the edged of my vision. Apart from my legs feeling as if they were thirty pounds heavier, I had no ill effects. In fact, I feel relaxed and happy, and completely content. I think I am still going to wait about a month of so to use the rest of the seeds, or till I can get some actual LSD that I wont have to throw back up."
14247,Losing Myself in a Flowing Stream,LookingDistant,"Jul 18, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"It took some magical seeds to open my mind, and allow me to realize that Tim Leary, Huxley and Eastern religion are right. The ultimate trip is the ego death, nirvana, enlightenment, when the doors of perception or cleansed, or when you break on through to the other side. Does really matter what you call it? I just know it is real now, through experience. Here is one such experience.   I was home from college for the holidays, and had a bunch of woodrose seeds, so my bro and me could trip. He was an experienced psychedelics user as was I, but he had never tried the seeds. One morning, we shaved up 12 seeds for each of us, pounded them and put them in a tea. I proceeded to drink it down. I didnt want to vomit, so we smoked a few bowls. This didnt work, and I ended up vomiting harshly in my friends backyard. I figured out later the nausea for me came from the taste; times since I have powdered them up and placed them in capsules.   I remember driving into the wilderness, my friend and I argued over where to trip.  [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]  I first was determined to find a nature spot. My friend was in a reckless Hunter S. Thompson mood, he downed a bottle of cough syrup while babbling about wandering around at the local mall. I was falling into the driving, as we speeded down a lonely Jersey road. The seeds were starting to kick in, and I mentioned that we better find somewhere to pull over soon. I became omni conscious as I was able to think about the road, contemplate the concept of an ever flowing road of life which was actually flowing, and see strange hallucinations in the corner of my eye such as my friend eating his face.  We pulled up to this creek surrounded by a crumbling set of bridges, and pine trees. While sitting in the car, we listened blissfully to Dark Side in the moon, I remember staring at the cloudy sky through the window and my hand, entranced in the complexities and details of each. After a while, who knows how long, we ventured outside. Perception was greatly altered, things seemed like miles away, and time was a funny joke. Things were moving, subtle changes and flowing, colors brightening and pulsating. I recall climbing up this crumbling bridge and standing on it. It was all pulsated out in the distance and expanding like ocean waves. I was alive, and happy with that fact and understanding. But I was still stuck in the concept of self. I still was aware of my desires, my fears, my hopes, my thoughts, and I was not detached from them.  A few hours later, I was stumbling by the edge of the stream.. The flowing water overtook me. It represented all the mysteries in life, and all the answers. My mind was blown, no thoughts, and all I could do was sit down and stare. The water sort of overtook me. I was completely still, looking at the endless flowing patterns in its eternal beauty. My self faded away, my desires and my fears. All the games I was playing, what eastern mystics call the ego died. I was beyond all concepts that can be discussed, I was beyond the beyond, and time was infinite. It was the realization of one-ness. At the ultimate point we are one with everything, and the goal of consciousness is to maintain this realization through all the levels. Then I was back, in the ego, although it was at a much peaceful and lesser level. I was simply content with being, with the here and the now. My friend walked over, having seen the same thing at the same moment. I said, This is it. This is what is all about. My friend nodded in understanding."
16603,Terminating the Woodrose,redcap,"Jun 27, 2005",H.B. Woodrose & Risperidone,"The first time I tried the seeds I ate 2 grams and had a wonderful time, although I terminated the experience with Risperdal (6 mg) because I felt I didn\'t have anything worthwhile to do since it was getting so late. I thought that if I took another gram I might see more intense visuals. I generally have to take more due to my large body mass. Also, I might add, that I had taken 1 to 2 grams (I don\'t quite remember) of Dream Herb (Calea zacatechichi), which might have made the trip more enjoyable. It has a tendency to calm and soothe me. I had not taken any dream herb on the second trip.    I had been diagnosed as Bi-polar and had been taking a regular amount of Welbutrin, Topamax, Effexor, and Risperdal for about a period of 6 months. But, I had stopped taking the Welbutrin, Topamax and Risperdal a few weeks before the trip. I had not taken any medication the day or the night before the trip.    The second time was a huge mistake. The day before I had a nervous breakdown in front of my parents, it had gotten so bad my moronic father called the cops on me, nothing happened although.     I had already removed the fuzz on the seeds and grinded up the rest of the 10 grams that I had bought from an online vendor. I put 1 gram inside of each pill and made 8 pills.    I took the three pills at 1:30PM. 40 min. later I was experiencing the trip slightly, I had expected to be completely in the trip an hour into it like I had the first time but it took two to three hours. I was feeling bored, and I was supposed to have the house to myself the entire afternoon. I didn\'t feel all too happy,  just down. Then my mother called and said she was coming home from work at 3. I had contemplated terminating the trip, but I didn\'t at that time.     I would eat quite a bit, the nausea wasn\'t really present. But, like the first time, I felt a lot of muscle pressure in my legs and feet, like they were sore from running. Later my mom came home, she didn\'t notice anything pecular about me, so I just went to my room. By now the trip was in full swing, and it was around 4. I felt bored as ever, trapped in the upstairs portion of my house. I begain thinking about what a bad idea it was to take the pills right after I had a breakdown. I went online and read a couple of reports about H.B Woodrose and decided that it would only get worse before it got better. So I took 8mg of Risperdal and layed down. I started listening to music and the trip was beginning to get better. But after 15-20 min. the Risperdal was kicking in and I was fighting it. I was beginning to feel drunk and tired, while at the same time the woodrose was still present trying to make me feel upbeat. I would yell and scream trying to just feel normal. I wanted the trip to end so badly, but it didn\'t. I didn\'t want to lay down, I didn\'t want to listen to music. I tried laying in my bed but it felt like the world was spinning underneath it, so I tried the floor. I felt like there was nothing for me to do. And I thought about ending my life. I thought about what a horrible substance it was, and what a mistake it was for me to take it.     I regretted taking the Risperdal. I thought about how I would feel the next day while coming down. I was starting to pound my head against things, and doing generally psychotic things like attempting to eat my fist. I would feel ok for a little while, but then my thoughts were turn sour. I felt like I had lost it. This was around 4:30-5:00 PM. Then I decided to take a bath. I leapt in and let it all sink out. The sound of the water filling the tub took my mind off things, and I had begun to relax. Things were turning around. I had felt extremely exahusted (because of the Risperdal), but I felt the trip leaving me. When the water had filled up, I quickly leaped out dried myself and went back to bed. I fell asleep shortly after.    I woke up at around 11:30 PM, because I needed to go to the bathroom. I could barely walk, I would stumble around, and I had great difficulty getting to the bathroom, which wasn\'t too far from my room. I even feared that I might be so tired and lazy that I might piss right there in my bed. I believe I took too much Risperdal, my normal every day dose is 2mg ,which I hadn\'t been taking 2 weeks prior. My mouth was extremely dry. Then I went downstairs to get something to drink. I felt like I had awakened from a coma.    The next day the Risperdal was still in my system and I slept and slept and slept only waking up to get something to drink or to use the rest room. I didn\'t feel normal until 6 PM the next day. I was glad it was over.    Looking back on the experience I realized to NEVER do a psychedelic drug if there is any doubt whatsoever of my mental stability. I might do it again, but with a much smaller dose. The increased dose didn\'t seem to do anything but make me crazy. I\'m thinking 1 gram will be enough for my next trip. I\'m just glad I have a large stockpile of antipsychotics to bring me out of bad trips, I wouldn\'t know what I would have done without my Risperdal.     This was the first time something like this has ever happened. And I had tripped on LSD, DXM and even salvia on several occasions without this problem. I thought that if something came up I could work around it, or I at least had a drug to end the trip. But ending an already bad trip can be just as harmful as staying inside the trip. I felt the Risperdal tearing down what the H.B. woodrose had carefully layed out putting me in a temporary state of psychosis. I felt like a lost sheep in a forest full of wolves. And the day after was no fun either.    The first time I had done it, I took the 6mg and just slept it off, no problem, just felt lagged the next day. I supposed the increased dosage and the absence of the dream herb might be the cause of my temporary psychosis."
15024,Blood and Colors,wesangsin,"Apr 12, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"Mushroom season is nearly five months away here in Washington, and with my addiction to pot finally defeated I had gone in search of some new substances to play around with. Here\'s a brief summery of an experiment I conducted using Hbwr seeds. I very carefully scraped all the fuzzy coating off twenty two seeds with a razor blade then ground them to a fine dust in an electric coffee grinder. I divided the pile into equal halves and poured them each into a shot glass. One glass of powder was left dry while the other was filled with acetone; the both were then covered with cling wrap. I used the acetone on one and not the other so that I could test the validity of an extraction method claiming that a nonpolar solvent will extract from the seeds all the \'stuff that makes you sick\' leaving the \'good stuff\' behind. Acetone is nonpolar, easier to get then Ether and less disgusting then lighter fluid. The shot glass with the acetone was then left to sit for a week, during this time I shook it daily. After the week was up I removed the cling wrap and let the acetone fully evaporate. then I filled each shot glass with 151 proof ethyl achohol, coverd with cling wrap and again let stand for one week. the seed powder was strained out with a very fine mesh coffee strainer and the liquid was poured into two seperate bottle to store in a cool dark drawer until I had a free weekend.     So when that weekend came I drank non-acetoned potion first. I should interject here that I am an experienced tripper and can handle my shrooms, acid and salvia. I don\'t have bad trips anymore. That being said I mixed the shot with oj and stirred it --down the hatch. about a half hour latter, back up the hatch it came.  I was relieved in a way to have the sickness over with and started a shower to ready myself for the evening. About five minutes into my shower it started. I felt removed in a pleasant way and my body looked frail and alien. I was surprised because I didn\'t think that I\'d kept it down long enough to get any effects. I\'t was deffinatly psychedelic but not in the undulating sensual way of mushrooms, nor in the catapulted into an electric world way like LSD. It was tranquil and floaty and removed and colorful. I sat down and stared at my legs. That\'s when I noticed that I was getting stuffed up, felt like a sinus infection.        After about ten more minutes I got out of the shower and began to rub myself dry. Still feeling stuffed up I blew my nose and to my astonishment the tissue was full of blood. That made me uncomfortable, I don\'t get nose bleeds not even when boxing with friends, I don\'t do crank or coke so what could it be? I recalled a report about a HBWR OD where a girl and her boyfriend vomited blood all night, possibly because of the cyanogenic glycosides in the seeds (same stuff as apple seeds). There are some that say that those C.G.s are just in the coating. I spent all night coughing and spitting blood. It could have been much worse though. Thank god I didn\'t keep that shot down I\'d have been flipped and probably hospital bound.    So some weeks latter, crazy as I be, I decide to try the acetoned potion, after all this one\'s supposed to be safer. Well this time I drank half the shot in OJ and didn\'t feel sick. An hour later: no effects, I take the rest, three hours after that: no effects. I proceeded to have a few beers and fall asleep content with these conclusions:    Polar and Nonpolar solvents extracted both the good and the bad.    I know of no easy way to make these seeds safe.    The poisons in these seeds aren\'t just in the fuzzy coatings.    All in all I didn\'t like \'em, to much for too little, however Morning glories work real well, I just let \'em soak in a shot of 151 for about a week and Zang! I\'m off. No sense in riskin\' it on these big ones when the little ones are so fine."
32352,Unexpected and Positive Results,VapourBoy</A,"Feb 15, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"Two previous experiments with LSA via morning glory seeds (about 1.5 and 3g respectively) resulted in noticeable effects that lacked a true identity. There was certain nausea and pupil dilation, but the other classically psychedelic effects were missing; the relatively short-lived experiences lacked insight and any perceptual changes. I was a bit disenchanted with this supposedly potent and powerful tryptamine.    Nonetheless, I acquire 50 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds and decided to give them a try as well as cultivating them in my entheogenic garden.    An early afternoon, along with R, my longtime co-psychonaut and L, a female friend of mine, I ingested six of the seeds. R also took six and L two. Instead of an extraction process which I had tried in the past with the morning glory seeds, we merely crushed the seeds and washed them down with water. The taste wasnt too disagreeable.    However, within 20 minutes, we were all feeling the first effects, the telltale nausea associated with the consumption of these seeds. It was quite uncomfortable and I immediately had second thoughts about eating the seeds. Marijuana did little to help. I can cope with extremely intense mental effects on psychedelics but dont do so well with body loads. Ls severe nausea lasted for about one and a half hours, but my nausea came in waves during that time frame and eventually left altogether. We all noticed that as the effects on the body lessened, those of the mental realm increased. I finally had success with LSA, much to my surprise.    The effects lasted a good four hours and were comprised of personal insight, enhanced interpersonal bonding and communication, sedation and increased confidence, not unlike LSD. Strangely enough, this experience lacked the self-loathing I have become so familiar with through my use of many other psychedelics. Vision, hearing and tactile sensations were all noticeably enhanced, although no visual distortions were noted during our experience together.    For myself, the comedown was quite easy, dictated only by extreme lethargy and a tendency to catch myself becoming too intensely interested in the mundane. R and L, however, were experiencing the familiar feeling of just wanting the substance to metabolize and release its grip on their minds.    Although sleep wasnt possible for several hours, the experience left me very tired. It was in bed that the visual distortions finally appeared. The folding effects on textured walls were quite similar to those I experience on psilocybin. Although fleeting, these visuals rounded off a worthwhile, if not somewhat unexpected, experience.    The severe nausea lasted only briefly, and enduring that discomfort was well worth the experience the seeds yielded. Ingestion of these seeds can result in a true psychedelic experience and as such they should be respected as any other entheogen is."
33199,Easy to Pretend I Was a Spaceship,no one,"Jul 5, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'d read about Hawaiian Baby Woodrose and LSA trips on the internet for quite some time, and after finally receiving some in the mail from an online supplier I decided to give them a try.    I crushed 10 seeds up with a half a brick until they were in fairly small pieces. I then put these pieces in a bottle of Spring Water in the fridge, and left it in there for roughly two hours, shaking every fifteen minutes. By the two hour mark the water was a fairly dark green, at which point I decided enough of the LSA had been extracted.    It was time to seperate the seed bits from the rest of the liquid, but I soon realised I had nothing to do this with. I decided to seperate the seed pulp from the spring water by pouring from one cup to another, and managed to keep most of the seed grit in the bottom of one cup, though there were very small pieces of seed that I ended up swallowing. It tasted like bark sort of but not too bad. A little honey countered the aftertaste. I drank it not too slowly, over the space of about 5 minutes.    I sat and watched for any signs the LSA was starting to kick in. At around half an hour after ingestion I noticed a flickering on my peripheral vision, on the top, bottom and sides. Interesting, I thought. I seem to remember something similar while high on weed, though I\'m not too sure.    At around one hour the flickering was more pronounced, kind of like what you see when there\'s a fan spinning just inside your peripheral vision. At around this same time I noticed the afterimage of the computer screen or other lights stayed with me for a lot longer than they normally would, like I could look at the screen then up at the roof and could quite clearly see a negative image of the screen for a good minute or two. It was hard to tell with a lot of these effects whether I was just imagining them or if it was really happening, as they were quite mild, though I later tested to see how long the afterimage of the computer screen remained on my retina while sober and it was only something like 10-20 seconds, rather than a full minute or two.     Music didn\'t sound profoundly better, though when my housemate put on some Bob Dylan I almost enjoyed it (I normally hate Bob Dylan) and when she put on Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon it set me off into odd thought processes and a sort of a day-dream, where I was picturing in my mind the things that were making the sounds in the music, like running footsteps and lasers shooting. They all seemed to be part of some story. I found throughout the trip I felt somewhat sedated - it felt very comfortable just lying around, I didn\'t really want to move and had the urge to lie on the carpeted floor alot. There were no real OEV\'s or CEV\'s, things just looked slightly odd, like the tree branch outside seemed to resemble some sort of creature, and the light playing off the water coming from the hose my housemate was watering with looked beautiful.    The peak came later than I expected, around 5 o\'clock. I went upstairs to go to the toilet. When I looked into the toilet bowl little bubbles morphed into a sea-horse shape and then a smiling face, which I waved at. I put my face right up to the patterned glass on the window which looked like it was made up of many different little figures and things, and laughed at it for a few seconds in a sort of a quiet wheezing laugh, like that cartoon dog I think is named Mutley.     Still smiling I then walked into the bathroom to check out my pupils. They were about twice as big as usual, which I knew was a good sign. I turned around and began to stumble out, at which point I noticed the house had taken on a sort of funhouse-like character. The walls and roof seemed to be at slightly odd angles, just like in a funhouse or a cartoon. I found this to be quite funny as well, though it seemed to stop by the time I got downstairs to where my housemate was.    At some point she went upstairs, so I decided to lie on my stomach on the carpet. (I highly recommend this as it is very comfortable). I looked forwards and heard my wingflaps lowering - yes that\'s right, for some reason I was suddenly a futuristic ship of some sort, or at least my head was, I didn\'t really notice my body.     Note: It is important to note at this point that I didn\'t actually fully believe I was a space ship, just that it was extremely easy to \'pretend\' I was a spaceship (though it felt almost real) and suspend disbelief as a child would. Its very hard to explain unless you\'ve felt something similar   yourself.    I powered up my systems and made a whooshing sound (either with my mouth or an aural hallucination, I\'m still not sure which) and I was away, rushing forwards along the carpet. I wasn\'t really moving but it felt like I was, I could even sort of see the movement of the \'landscape\' around me. I stopped, then fired lasers at the door, then the bottom leg of the computer desk. I then pretty much gave up on this game, and just looked down at the carpet directly in front of my face, which suddenly seemed extremely close and incredibly detailed. And also, for a moment or two it felt like I was leaning up against some soft wall, rather than lying down on a carpet. I said \'holy crap\', then, hearing my housemate coming back down the stairs jumped to my feet and back onto the couch in my previous relaxed position, as I didn\'t want her to find me lying face down on the carpet saying \'holy crap\' over and over again (she thinks I\'m nuts already without me doing that).     I sat and looked at two plastic figurines on the other side of the room, who in the lower light seemed to be moving just a little and looking at each other, which reminded me exactly of when I was a little kid, lying in my bed at night watching the things in my room seem to move, but knowing that they weren\'t actually moving at all.    That\'s about all that really is worth telling about this trip. It lasted I guess for about 5 hours, peaking at between 3.5 and 4.5 hours. There was a slight sense of nausea in the beginning which lasted about an hour, but it wasn\'t really noticeable and didn\'t affect me too much. I didn\'t feel any of the tightness behind my knees or anywhere like I\'ve read some people have experienced in other reports, but this may have to do with the way I ingested the seeds. There was a general sense of silliness and uncoordination throughout, not unlike being slightly drunk, but my mind was mostly clear and I was able to think pretty much soberly most of the time, (except for when I thought I was a spaceship I guess!).  It was definitely interesting and I will be trying this again, perhaps with slightly more seeds, around 14? a longer water extraction time maybe or perhaps just eaten straight or taken sublingually so I don\'t need as many, and possibly with someone else who is also tripping which I imagine would intensify things somewhat :)"
29665,This Changes Everything,neon green snake,"Jan 17, 2004",H.B. Woodrose & Nitrous Oxide,"It\'s been a while since this took place, but not too long. I have to use extensive detail so that the reader can understand the mystical experience and so that the reader knows what the trail looked like on the way to divinity. It was mid summer, and a good friend\'s birthday was upon us. I had just recieved a package in the mail a week prior containing 50 hbw seeds I bought from a trusted supplier. About half of them were gone, I had eaten some with some friends the day I got them. I had about 25 seeds ground up into a fine powder when I was invited to a huge party the birthday dude was throwing. I had just gotten my paycheck so I bought a box of nitrous oxide cartridges from the smoke shop up the road and some anti-nausea medicine to counteract the almost inevitable nausea experienced when injesting hbw.     I set out to my friend\'s house with a backpack full of: a change of clothes, the drugs and medicine, a few sobes, some music, and a discman (solely for comforting me in case my trip goes bad and I have to isolate from the crowd, music is the most potent antidote for me for a downward spiraling trip). I catch the bus and make it to his hometown by about 5:00 pm. He said not to show up until about 6pm, so I went to hang out at the park and took a few inhales of nitrous to kill a little time. By the way, I have a metal cracker and a baloon for the cartridges.     5:45 rolls around and I head over to his house. Physical preparation ideas, I\'ll let you know that all I had to eat all day was a breakfast sandwich from work and a sobe. The breakfast sandwich was consumed at about noon and the sobe was consumed on the bus on the way to the party. I arrive and give everyone hugs and refrain from telling him what I brought for him right away. I check out what\'s happening and there\'s about 10 people and more to come. At about 6:30, I pull b-day boy aside and let him know what\'s in store for his mind. He smiles at the concept and is immediately eager to dose. To further help reduce nausea, we take small doses, just a little pinch every 10-15 minutes or so. Everything goes in a direction completely unexpected. At about 7:30, we had all we were planning on taking in our bellies, and I had about 2 pinches each for us to prolong the trip later on. I know I\'m starting to feel more towards weightless and warm by now.     We\'ll call b-day boy J. J decides to spend some private minutes in the bedroom with his girlfriend and at the moment most of the partiers were gone trying to get weed or something else or whatever. There was only 3 people in the backyard. So I sit out in the front yard talking with this guy who lives in his car in front of their house. He\'s a good friend of the family, real cool guy. It was about 7:45 now and I was starting to feel the shit squirm around in my stomach, arousing a little nausea but not much. I found myself glancing around wild eyed and rubbing my chest and my belly because my skin was crawling and tickling itself. I started to get the urge to move around and asked the dude if he wanted to walk to the store with me. While it seemed he was extremely slow getting his shoes on and stuff, taking his sweet little time, I was pacing back and forth, slowly getting higher and lighter and...weirder. The nausea was intensifying, but despite the upsetting texture, I drank a tall can, one of the 10 others I brought over for everyone. 211 malt beverage to be exact.     It didn\'t seem like I drank it too quickly, with my internal clock slowed down and all, but the whole thing was finished by the time we got out the door. I noticed that everytime I took a swig, I felt immediate relief from the nausea, but if I let the liquid settle in my stomach, the nausea came back magnified, so that contributed to why I drank it so fast. I was definitely losing myself by now, 5 minutes till 8. I was glancing around at the beautiful mountains, experiencing an exagerated feeling of wellbeing, and noticing a tingly fuzzy feeling moving around in my head and spreading slowly to the rest of my body. It took an hour to walk a block in the state of time I was in at the moment. In reality, it took about 2 1/2 minutes. Now, to this day, I don\'t know if I hallucinated it or not, but when I was at the store waiting for dude to pick out a beer, I looked out the window and I swear I saw the dude that kicked my door down months back, waiting by the phone booth, glaring at me. Oh well, anyways...    We get back to the house, and it\'s about 8pm when I see J\'s best friend in the front yard, looking all pissed off. He looked up and was definitely happy to see me, I don\'t visit these people much. Then he told me that it probably wouldn\'t be best for me to go inside, that J was in a state of ineffable rage. My eyes bulged out of my head, I said, \'shit! Why...why?\' he told me it was all drama and I shrugged him off and ran inside to get the whole picture. Sure enough, J was pacing back and forth with tears streaming down his angry red hot face, murderous texture singed his expression, fists clenched. I hurried up to him and put my hand on his back and said, \'hey, bro, what the hell\'s going on?\' he couldn\'t make eye contact with me, he was too upset, but he explained that his mom was freaking out about some missing money and blamed it on him. I knew he would not take his mother\'s money, especially on that particular night considering he just got paid and had a crap load of b-day money. I was immediately furious with his mom for enabling this insanity, although she probably didn\'t know he was on lsd\'s closest cousin.     I insisted we go for a walk. I was tripping out! This was not the energy intended! This was hell! His knuckles were bleeding, he said he tried putting it through his door, 4 attempts. I asked if he was high yet after I got him to smile. He said he didn\'t know, he was too shocked about the accusation and said he thinks the rage counteracted the lsa. He asked me to split the rest with him and I did, giving him the better half since I was damn near frying balls by now and he was sober. Or at least that\'s what he thought. Before he gave the re-dose enough time to kick in, and he was over the whole dramatic bullshit, he started telling me he was wrong, he\'s pretty damn high. Ok, I\'m stretching this whole story simply to build a better picture of what\'s about to happen. Be patient...    We hung out outside until about 8:30, until everybody was done tripping out. J went in the house to make a phone call for some weed and I stayed out and talked with his girlfriend. We had a little giggle about how hell just broke loose and disappeared without a trace in the span of an hour. Then something snagged me by the roots of my stomach and I appologized, \'excuse me sweety, but I gotta...run around the corner her an...\' I couldn\'t finish, I sprinted to the side of the house where she couldn\'t see me, so as not to gross her out, and I let it all go. Barfed all over the grassy area there. But let me tell you what...I loved it! My state of mind made it feel like a release, a relief, not painful at all! The barfing itself, I can honestly say, was actually euphoric. I stood back up with the biggest smile on my face! Throwing up made me like 3 times as high as I was! Visuals were starting to kick in fully now. The colors in the trees and the clouds and the road were splitting into three different colors, kinda like double or triple vision, but the object itself wasn\'t splitting, just the colors.     Standing back up felt like waking up in a weird way I will not attempt to explain. I stumble back out into the front yard and exclaim, \'don\'t worry, no negativity in this fireproof belly, I feel like a million bucks...where\'s J?\' inside...I walk inside and I can tell the journey is just getting started. It seems like I\'m seeing everything for the first time, and I\'m just looking around in this state of obvious awe, no need to look in the mirror to check, my pupils were as big as they\'ll ever be! I could feel them opening up trying to swallow everything they see. Literally! It was as if I was touching everything with these invisible, divine hands that branched out from my black hole eyes! I found J in the backyard telling everybody he would be right back. He saw me and smiled, \'holy shit, I didn\'t know this shit would be so intense! It\'s like acid but with more of a natural and physical texture!\' he was rubbing his arms and face and chest like he took some really good ecstacy. \'I gotta go get some weed, you wanna run with me?\'     Before I could answer he said, \'wait...I feel so comfortable here at my home with my family here and stuff, I\'ll get my little bro to go pick it up for me.\' and he did just that. Everything was happening so fast, yet time was going so unbelievably slow! If I didn\'t notice it was still not dark yet I would have guessed it was the wee hours of early morning! But no, it was...10 minutes to 9! I couldn\'t belive my eyes when he held out his pocket watch to me. This is where I decided to drop the time habit for the night, since it was in fact irrelevant. Now he doesn\'t know I brought nitrous oxide with me. It\'s another one of those surprises I wanted to hit him with when we were frying balls, and the time had come. \'Hey J, how does a balloon full of bliss sound?\' he looked up at me with that look someone might give right before they explode in excitement after winning the lottery. The pre-shock look. The luminous look, like I just told him the meaning of life and it all made sense to him finally. He had that grin, that mischievous grin, with that distant hint of fear. He didn\'t know if he wanted to, but he knew he was going to.     \'You brought gas?! Holy shit you sure know how to swim the deep end you fucker!\' so we hurry back to his room, and I think. \'I think we should do it outside, sitting down in the grass, it will be comfortable.\' he nodded, so we take it outside and people see what we\'re up to and like 6 people start following us around. We keep exchanging these looks like we\'re the only ones who know that life is just a dream, and everything is a mirage. Before I inhaled the gas I thought. \'I think we should step away from this crowd, it feels too weird.\' he nodded, so we go and sit in chairs on his back porch next to the music and the crowd got the picture and split up a little. He took the first one and I barely remember him saying some weird shit as he let it out and his eyes got sooo wild and fear froze him solid, followed by excitement and nirvana, followed by exhilaration and breathlessness, followed by a, \'...oh god.\' I got the hint and quickly filled my balloon up and waved everyone goodbye. I looked at J and he nodded, telepathically wishing me luck on finding my way back to reality.     I inhale and hold it. Time stops. People are still talking, I can hear them, but their bodies were moving sooo much slower than their voices and time was not budging. The fabric of reality announced its presence as it slowly started to rip and shred. Every ounce of familiarity vanished, every ounce of sense died, and I felt like the air was converting itself to water. I was still holding my hit in. I let it out. I\'m under water trying to catch my breathe. The bodies moving around in my field of vision struck me as aliens. Unfamilar beings. Maybe even not bodies at all but spirits. Bubbles were coming out of everybody\'s mouth as well as mine. I came to realize that I just slid past like 10 parallel realities and landed on one randomly. I was light years away from the party. Time didn\'t even occur to me, it was inexistent. I would have wept but I wasn\'t aware I was part of the physical anymore. It was all so beautiful. Like exploring a place on a far away planet nobody in the entire history of man or the entire future of man well ever even fathom.     When the nitrous wore off, reality came back to me in an interesting way. All the unfamiliarity simply struck me as familiar out of nowhere. Nothing visually or physically changed, I just simply recognized everything after in irrefragable amount of time. After I reassembled, I quickly told J about what had just happened to me and his experience had a similar texture, but was completely different. Another way to put it is he experienced the sliding across parallel realities, but he didn\'t land on the same one I did. He didn\'t breathe under water or anything like that. As soon as we calmed down, his brother got back with his pot and we were psyched! We hurried to the bedroom and put on some bob marley and rolled some joints. I was out of my mind. I was totally on a far out acid trip, nothing more, nothing less, and I was completely indulged! The reggae music definitely had a positive impact on our state of mind. We started giggling and dancing to the music, people were coming in and out of the room. Everyone was drunk except us. We were on a way different plateau! The reggae/stoney experience in the room was a trip all in it\'s own.     His little brother was drunk and getting drunker and was becoming beligerent so we all had to struggle to get him to stay out of our bubble. He wanted to hit the weed but he was so drunk we were afraid he\'d pass out on the floor. The sands of time, the smoke of vulnerability, and the ocean of alteration was being blown in all sorts of crazy directions at all sorts of crazy speeds. We hang out in the backyard for a while and enjoy our lovely psychedelic state of mind, listening to the best of the best, tool, and a little mudvayne as well. I have 3 nitrous cartridges left and I decide it\'s time to see what the synergy at this point in our trip would feel like. This time we\'re in the kitchen standing around with the homeless dude and J\'s girlfriend tripping out and having an uplifting conversation. I prepare 2 balloons, his girlfriend wasn\'t interested and I was planning on giving the 3rd one to the homeless guy. This time, we take our hits at the same time, unity of mind travel I later called it.     When I was holding it in, it was soooo much more different than earlier. Instead of the fabric of reality ripping and shreding and pushing me along the slideshow of parallels, the fabric was already shredded as if it remained in the state I left it in earlier, but I didn\'t slide. Instead, everything dimmed and the majority of colors became red and brown tinted and my thought process spun out of control and my mouth just let all the scrambled shit out in a jumble of nonsense, which made sense to me at the time. I realized I would fall on my face if I stayed standing so I slowly sat down on the kitchen floor and as I was lowering myself to the ground, I felt like I was a candle, and instead of lowering myself to the ground, I was simply melting, becoming a puddle of wax on the linoleum. The cupboard door I sat back against grabbed me like a magnet and I was just struck with the complete opposite of weightlessness. I was terrified of what had just entered my mind, but in a state of ecstacy in the same exact moment.     The gas wore off and me and J exchanged looks of fascination. We shared each other\'s experience and then turned to the homeless guy and asked if he wanted the last one and the look on his face that resulted in observing how we acted told us he was having second thoughts. He shook his head no with obvious fear in his eyes and I shrugged my shoulder and said, \'well, J, happy birthday.\' and he said, \'No dude, my mind is fucking mush, you bought em anyways, go for it.\' So I filled up the balloon, inhaled and was blasted right back into the vortex of confusion and separation. I remember yelling the same two words over and over again, \'satisfying synergy!\' and the weirdest part was that I didn\'t know the definition of synergy as a human. It\'s as if I tapped into some other mind and used its vocabulary to express what I was feeling. I looked up synergy the next day and it tripped me out because the concept fit perfectly with the situation.     For the rest of the night after that last whipit, was basically a really slow come down. I walked around in this state of stupor and vacantness and, my mind was indeed mush. I drank a few beers to help me drift off to sleep way later.     I hope the experience and detail and setting helps you all to assemble a general picture of hbw effects and it\'s synergistic potential. I definitely do not recommend the mixture of lsa with nitrous to the inexperienced. It\'s a very vulnerable state and accidents can and will happen in those kind of situations. My fellow psychonauts, please be safe, overindulgence is not a virtue, caution is. For the beginner psychedelic users, a few words of wisdom for general trip setting ideas. Keep the energy positive. Do not interact with people who would get upset if they found out you were high, you will freak out and you will then know what a bad trip is all about. Have a sitter with you when exploring unmarked territory and have a backup plan. Avoid authority at all costs and watch your drug interactions. Music is a good backup plan for the comfort of a trip gone bad. Peace and lots of love.    Sincerely,   Just a burning soul singing the frays in the fabric of reality"
29807,"Great Start, Lousy Finish",Louderklim,"Jan 7, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"The first dosage I took was 5 seeds scraped then singed to clean the fuzz, then chewed and swallowed.  This yielded an interesting New Years, where I was unquestionably high but quite able to enjoy conversations with a little confusion.  Eating was quite the ordeal, and I had trouble swallowing.  It\'s like I had to force my body to perform the act of swallowing, but everything tasted really interesting.       Two days later, I made the same preparation but this time crushed the 9 seeds left and soaked them in lime juice for 5 hours to bring out the properties.  I drank the concoction at 7pm and went to a friend\'s to wait for the effects.  I noticed soon that my mind was tuning up as often happens on psychedelics.  I would get waves of ecstacy and with each wave became higher.  It was much as I remember strong weed highs beginning (as I\'ve given up illegal subtances for some years).      As my buddy played music on his computer, it sounded profound, yet couldn\'t really keep my attention and I was buzzing pretty hard.  So I headed back to my place.  As I arrived home at about 8pm, I was very high and noticed everything was really bright.  Suddenly, the apartment felt like the carribbean, wet and pleasant, even though it\'s the middle of winter in the mountains, and the windows were open to let the cold dry air in. I mean, I was IN the Carribbean at that moment. I found myself drifting back to beloved memories of the islands, really feeling the feelings from those times for the first time in years.  I lay on my bed and looked out the window at the clouds in the night sky.  Though it was dark, there was a beautiful purple sunset shining on them.  It was a Carribbean sunset.  Everything felt wonderful.  This lasted for a little while and I started a movie on the tv.      At about 9:30, things turned a bit nasty.  I found my breath getting short.  No matter how I tried, I couldn\'t fill my lungs while laying down.  Like an asthma attack.  I started to toss and turn in the bed as the high wore off and all that was left was an over-stimulated anxiety.  I started to moan and groan and was worried my roommates would hear me and come check on me.  But groaning was the only thing that felt good.  I got up and started out to see some girls I knew, but only made it downstairs to watch the neighbors play video games.  I didn\'t get to sleep until 1:30am but slept like a rock for 10 hours when I did.    Overall, I don\'t feel this was a bad trip, but did worry a lot about dying when I was having trouble breathing.  I realize now it was silly, as when I got up, and moved, I felt better.  I probably won\'t try these again, but the initial couple of hours were the best legal high I\'ve had and one of the more pleasant trips I\'ve had.  I wouldn\'t recommend doing these right before bed as there seems to be a strong stimulant effect to them and it was really unpleasant to be so wired and confused at the same time.  If the high had lasted into the jitters, it would have been more worth it."
22835,My Perception of a Near Death Syrian Rue OD,Salviadog,"Apr 16, 2003",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue,"I got a package in the mail in the middle of spring break. It contained 50 HBW seeds and 2 oz. Syrian rue seeds. I immediately started on the lemon juice syrian rue extraction with about a heaping tablespoon of seeds. The plan was to take about 1/3 of the extraction on the following day.    I figured I would eat just one HBW seed while I was boiling the rue just to see if it would do anything to me. Well, not much effect but I could tell my mind was running a mile a minute and I was thinking of very neat creative ideas. After this started to subside, and my extraction was complete, I decided it would be a good idea to try out the syrian rue that night. So I drank one third of the concoction, and in about five minutes I started to feel this warm flushing sensation in my head and remember saying \'Wow, this is awesome.\' So, I went and grabbed the rest of the syrian rue and drank it all. BIG MISTAKE!!!    Being in a very good mood and starting to feel a little dizzy I had to go take a piss. I half-stumbled to the bathroom and was pissing when I noticed I heard a fan running (the so-called carrier wave). I was wondering where it was coming from and went out to the living room, where the buzzing sound followed me, and asked my roomate if he heard it; of course, he said no. So I was starting to trip and went upstairs, I looked online for when I would peak after taking syrian rue. It was very hard to do, and eventually I gave up and I started to trip pretty hard only about a half hour into it.     It was not a very pleasant sensation anymore, great feelings of anxiety and paranoia began to set in. I decided to lay down on my bed because I also felt light-headed. I tripped worse and worse until I finally felt that I took too much and got up to puke. I came back to bed and looked at the time. Thinking that I had peaked I said to myself, \'It\'s ok, just wait it out, it\'ll all be over soon.\' I try falling asleep, and it seems like I\'ve been trying for about a half hour. I look at the clock again, and it says that two minutes have past.     Oh crap, now I\'m starting to get worried as the second wave of nausea hits me. I stumble to the bathroom feeling as if I\'m going to faint. Puke a bunch, go back to bed. I close my eyes and begin to see a cycle of flashing colors, Blue...Red...Green over and over. I manage to fall asleep again for about a half hour. Wake up, and notice things have gotten worse, I go to the bathroom and now I have to puke, I\'ve got the shits, and I\'ve got to piss. Worst feeling EVER. Go back to bed, try falling asleep, some very cool CEVs occur. One was a blue 3-D room with some creatures and a ladder (reminded me of HR Puff and Stuff even though I\'ve never seen an episode).     Wake up an hour later and open my eyes. There\'s a frame around my eyes and whenever I move them, it flashes. Tracers abound, I moved my hand in front of my eyes and it was one of the coolest things I have ever seen. When I got up to go to the bathroom, I would think that I was farther along than I was, so I would have to stop for a second and jump back into my body.   Back in bed, I\'m starting to feel very depressed about the fact that I was going to die. I started to think about my home and how I didn\'t get along too well with my parents, but it was all my fault. I just lay my head down, knowing I was going to die and never be able to make amends with my family. Woke up about two hours later, still seeing the \'eye-frame\' and tracers, but the tripping sensation was gone.     Woke up again about three hours later, everything seemed normal but I still was seeing tracers and started to get worried because of what I had read about HPPD and I thought I was going to be f**ked for life. This really didn\'t matter in the scheme of things though, because I didn\'t die overnight. Luckily, the tracers subsided in another three hours, and I thought I was in the clear. The next day, I started to feel funny again, maybe because of what I ate. I decided to sleep it off instead of dealing with it. At school a few days later I started to flashback again, but luckily I got it to stop. Now, I think I\'m actually still seeing tracers, I thought it was like normal at first, but it\'s not. They don\'t interfere with my daily life though, so that\'s a plus.    So, my trip lasted about 6 hours, with afterimages for another 6, and tracers that will probably last a lifetime. I don\'t think I would have taken that much rue if I wouldn\'t have take LSA right before. It must have lowered my inhibitions. In short, this was the worst I\'ve ever felt in my entire life, and the closest to having a near death experience. Not all bad though, I am trying to get back on good terms with my family.   To those of you out there who think that syrian rue isn\'t psychoactive by itself, you are dead wrong. But, to get the desired effects, you might just have to almost kill yourself."
21381,On the Brink of Insanity,Trip Daddy,"Feb 16, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,I went to a friends house and told him about them and we both agreed to take some.  I took eight of them and he took five. We dosed at around 8:00pm  We sat back and smoked a joint waiting for the effects.    At about 10:00pm I had noticed I was still high and I knew it couldnt be from the joint of that dirt weed. I thought that was probably all it was going to be is a nice high. I was very mistaken! It just kept getting better and more intense. about 10:45 I started seeing slight peripheral tracers. I had no nausea whatsoever but my friend was running to the toilet to puke right about now.    It started getting real intense just like good acid. 11:30 My friends girlfriend started fighting with him because he was acting so stupid. This sent me right into a bad trip. He left to go in the other room and started fighting with her. I started to feel so alone like there wasnt anyone else in the universe.    11:45 I\'m still alone and I\'m starting to trip pretty hard. I thought I had taken too much and I was dying or causing permanant brain damage. I started having a panic atta ck and asked them to take me to the E.R. But they said that they would probably put me in a psych ward or something. That sent me even deeper into panic. I convinced them to at least take me home. 1:00am The ride home was a collage of colors and shapes It was very beautiful.    1:25am I walk in the door of my house and climb upstairs to get a bath and try and calm down. My bathtub was changing shapes and the spickets seemed to turn into devil horns and It looke like the water was bubbling all around me. Fearful that I was burning mysel inadvertantly I jumped out and dried off and went downstairs.    By now it was about 1:50am and I started calming down and learned to enjoy the buzz. Everything felt so good and looked so wild. It was like the best acid I ever had!! I continued tripping until about 7:00am when I lost all of my visuals. all and all I kinda liked it I just wish I hadnt flipped out like I did and ruin my best friends trip. It was a very self revealing and spiritual thing. Will I try them again. Hell yes!! But this time not so many. I underestimated it because I thought it really wouldnt work anywhere neer that good. Just be safe if you decide to try these because they are a very powerful psychadelic. They have definitely earned my respect.
19180,Riders On The Storm,Anon,"Dec 4, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"First LSA  (Riders On The Storm)      Substance:  Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds  (argyreia nervosa)    Subject:  Male/40yrs, 160 LB    Health Status: Fair    Medications: None    Nutritional Status: Excellent    History:  LSD---quite familiar.  Mushrooms---only a few small trips.  Cannabis---extensive.  --------------------------------------------------------------------      After a 5-yr. vacation from psychedelics, subject decided to try an LSA intoxication.  The first attempt was disastrous for reasons unnecessary to discuss, but successful enough to know I had the real deal (HBWS) here.  Three days later I visited a friend who had not tripped in yrs and wanted too.  My friend and his g/f did a clear water extraction of 12 seeds.  Time: approx. 9:00 PM.  The seeds were first thoroughly scrapped with a sharp knife and then crushed with pliers, then ground into semi-powder form.  Seed powder was emptied and shaken in clear water (about 4oz) plastic bottle for aprox 20 minutes.  The contents was filtered and  4 more oz water added and filtered again.  Friend began to trip about 30 minutes following ingestion.  G/f crashed out in bed.   My g/f and I repeated the extraction process w/ 6 seeds.  She never felt any effects except some nausea, while I began feeling the effects immediately.      It was an unseasonably warm November night with severe thunderstorm warnings on TV and the beginnings of lightning in the air.  After about 30 minutes, I experienced no nausea and decided to crush and chew one seed.  With my g/f needing to go to her home in the country, we split leaving my friend zoned out on computer games but tripping indeed.  By the time we got to her house (proly 1 hr after ingestion) I began experiencing all the conscious expanding qualities typical of LSD intoxication with the exception of visual hallucination.  It was a rather rustic setting in rural mid-south U.S.A.  I took a peculiar notice of several pieces of engraved artifacts.  Hand or factory made clay, ceramic or synthetic, painted clowns, jesters, Native American Indians, among others.  Not having much exposure to primary art forms, I simply let my LSA mind absorb these motionless artifacts, feeling the intent of their existence.      With the need to return to my place (approx. 40 miles), we hit the road.  Shit, now Im peaking and this storm is getting closer.  I simply took my time and relished the experience.  Beautiful colored bright autumn leaves in and from trees swirling in the lightning charged night sky and shinning brilliant in the car headlights.  Not many miles to destination, we hit a severe storm w/ intense rain and wind.  I didnt seem prone to panic and willed my mind into a survival mode.  Riders On The Storm.  The remaining trip was simply focused on getting some sleep.  6 mg melatonin and some herbal sleep aid closed the curtain quite well.  I woke about 5 hrs latter quite refreshed and energetic and experienced a good afterglow all day.  HBWS have a distinguishable and authentic ergot signature.        It is now almost 6 days latter and I still feel the remnants of this plants power.  I had planned on dosing again yesterday but could not.  After a 24 hr extraction of 4 seeds, I tried a rectal administration only hrs ago w/ no noticeable effects except runny stool from enema.  From now on I will extract w/ clear water for about 15 minutes; any longer extraction period would presumably only allow more undesirable plant material and its bad side effects.  If my plant matter were in a more pulverized form (powder), the recommended 6 minuets would probably be ideal.    Philosophical Implications:  The overriding thought during this trip was the mysterious nature of reality.  This psychedelic experience did reveal the fact that reality isnt what ones rational mind always supposed it to be, but what indeed is reality?  What philosophy, religion, art, science, will objectify my subjective experience?  As my mind spanned across numerous paths both far and near, I could only know that Mind must be directed by Will in whichever path possible in my world.        My mind is large and path is small  A morning glory becomes an evening fall"
18106,Twin Peaks,Anonymous,"Oct 11, 2002",H.B. Woodrose & Nitrous Oxide,"I had just received a package of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds in the mail, and was able to finally try them. I was somewhat concerned about nausea, although I hadn\'t eaten anything since 7:30PM the night before (I consumed the seeds at 11:30AM).    11:30AM - I didn\'t scrape off the coating, I just popped 5 seeds into my mouth and started chewing. They were initially pretty tough to chew, and tasted a little bit like peanuts to start with. I chewed them for several minutes, until they had been mashed into a fine paste. They started to taste very bitter, but it wasn\'t too mad. I swallowed them, and then swished around with some water to make sure I got all the little pieces.    12:00PM - Consumed 5 more seeds in the same manner. I turned on Twelve Monkeys to pass the time until they kicked in.    12:30 to 1:45PM - Watched the movie as waves of mild nausea passed over me. I didn\'t feel too sick; I didn\'t puke. Just some uncomfortableness in my stomach and a slight headache. During this timeframe, since it was taking so long, I wondered if I would get anything at all other than nausea.    1:45PM - I start to feel light and happy, almost like that coming up feeling you get before a roll.    1:55PM - I smell marijuana smoke, even though I haven\'t smoked any. I think this may be caused by the bitter nutty taste of the seeds permeated through my sense of taste and smell.    2:35PM - Interesting visuals; looking at a plain white computer screen, I can see little particles floating around in the air in front of the monitor. They flicker and float, and then disappear.     2:45PM - At this point I began to think about the seeds, and how they are poisonous as a survival technique. I questioned whether if the seeds just make animals sick, so that particular animal doesn\'t eat it again, or if the seeds actually kill off any animal that tries to eat it, so that there are no more animals around to eat it.    Although I knew that I hadn\'t taken enough seeds to be poisoned (I\'m not even sure what the lethal amount would be), I was still afraid that I would somehow die and I wouldn\'t be able to tell a certain someone something very important. I wrote down a letter stating my feelings for this person and how I was afraid that because of these seeds, I would never get to see them again. It was very emotional and I was crying very heavily as I wrote out this letter, because I was seriously afraid that I would die. I knew that I wouldn\'t, but I wrote it down, just in case.     3:15PM - After sitting quietly for the last half hour, I feel safe again. I don\'t feel like I am dying. Having never consumed these seeds before, I assumed that the emotional peak I had just experienced was the actual peak of the trip. Now I was just seeing mild visuals, such as color patterns on the white wall, or prismatic colors outside the window. I have a few laughs watching the mouse pointer float around on the screen against a white background.     4:00PM - I feel almost back to normal, as if the trip was already over. I was very tired and hungry. I was still feeling mild nausea off and on, but felt that since that trip was almost over, I could handle eating a small something. I ate 3 Ritz crackers and started to feel very nauseaus. I put my AIM conversations on hold and lean back in my chair for several minutes, hoping that the nausea will pass.     4:15PM - As I am sitting there, I start to get very intense closed eye visuals. Everything was very bright, and I pictured a large swatch of blue color being ripped apart by a swatch of red color, as if the universe itself were made of color and was being ripped in half.     4:30PM - The intense fractal patterns when I close my eyes still continue. The closed eye visuals were more of a colorful fractal patterning; there was no mind\'s eye slideshow or filmstrips of people or places. Just swirls and colorful shapes. I have a very pleasant body energy. It\'s like everything I feel sends electrical impulses through my skin. Everything I see or touch is shimmering or vibrating very rapidly. My lower lips feels very light and tingly.     At this point I am able to startup my AIM conversations again. I wonder if what I had just experienced was the actual peak of the trip, or if my very emotional thoughts earlier were the peak. If this was the \'real\' peak, then I am not sure what the 1st peak was. Perhaps just fear. If the 1st peak was, in fact, the real peak, I wonder if due to my general somber attitude I was actually tripping hard this entire time, I just didn\'t know it because I am so calm all the time. Perhaps eating those crackers and the resultant nausea took me out of my passive state and made me realize that I was actually tripping.    5:00PM - I venture into the bathroom and have a look in the mirror. The lines and pores under my eyes are moving against each other in rows, like lanes of traffic. My skin is gently swirling and shifting. My lower lip (still tingly) appears to be vibrating in the mirror, and it also grows and shrinks. I can see the lines on my hands and arms and face with amazing clarity; I can see every little piece of (im)perfection.    5:30PM - Back in my captain\'s chair, my cat jumps up on my lap. Since my chair is leaned all the way back, he tries to walk across my stomach. It seems like my entire body is filled with gel, like those mousepad handrests, and he has trouble walking. I do him a favor and sit up, so he can sit on my lap. His fur is very electric and soft, and it feels amazing to rub my face against his fur. The other cat comes up and they lock their heads into each other\'s necks and embrace. I pet both of them and it seems like we are all experiencing this together, as if the cats always feel this way and are happy that I am finally able to share their feelings with them.    5:45PM - One of the cats is sitting on the windowsill. His eyes grow bigger and his chin grows smaller, so he looks like the cross between a lion and a precious moments style cat. His fur seems to grow longer and then shorted, and his shoulders seem to hunch up and then go back to normal.     6:30PM - I go back into the bathroom and turn on my magic color-changing light. I turn out the regular light and sit on the floor in the dark, with shades of red, blue, green and purple flashing across all the surfaces. I inhale a bulb of nitrous from a balloon and then my mind kicks into overdrive. My body and mind seem to battle it out between senses and thoughts. Initially I start thinking about sight vs sound, then the body vs the mind, the life vs death, and the something vs nothing aka binary states over the span of a few seconds.     I start thinking that given two states, something and nothing, nothing cannot exist because than that particular state would be something. Therefore, if nothing cannot exist, then something exists after death. If something exists after death (aka Heaven vs Hell), wouldn\'t it be better to believe in God and go to Heaven, then to believe in nothing and go to Hell (previous to this experience, I was a devout atheist, having very scientific views about everything).     I then felt that if I was to believe in God, I should start to settle down and think about starting a family and living out the rest of my life in a peaceful, non-destructive way. I thought back to the receipient of my \'death letter\' that I had written earlier, and decided that I should really try to patch things up with her.     7:30PM - The visuals and energy are dissipating, and I am starting to feel very lethargic. My appetite has returned, and there is little to no nausea, and I eat perhaps 15 more Ritz crackers. They are very salty and buttery, and are perhaps the best crackers I have ever tasted.    8:30PM - Feeling very tired and worn out, I get into bed. I fall asleep easily.    10:30AM (the next day) - I have slept a very long time, but feel very, very refreshed and rejuvenated. I feel very happy and clear as to my future and am very satisfied with what I learned the day before, especially regarding the beginning of my desire to build a relationship with God.     Reading other trip reports, I did not experience the harsh nausea that many other people have. I think that I have very good seeds, because I consumed them a week later after eating only 5 hours previous (as opposed to ~16 hours). So, they are either very good, or very weak. Since this is the only batch of seeds I have had, I do not know if the trip I experienced is weak or not. It was very interesting and fun, and very educational and introspective. I am satisfied with the quality of the trip I received for the quantity of seeds I consumed. It was an amazing adventure."
14344,Waves of Joy & Lucidity,Curious,"May 1, 2002",H. B. Woodrose,"I had an excellent experience with some Tahitian grown HBWR seeds that I\'d like to share.  Taking a lot of the advice from folks on the net, I first prepared it as follows:    I scraped the little husk and fuzzy layer of the outside of the seed as best I could, then put a match to the seed to try to get more of the fuzzy layer.  I placed 5 seeds in a plastic baggie & smashed them a little with a hammer.  (The little bastards are really tough.)  I then ate the broken seeds, chewing them in my mouth for a while as well.  I ate them on an empty stomach (except for a vitamin-c tablet I had earlier, dunno if it helped at all or anything) at around 2:30pm, and had some orange juice as a chaser for the taste.  (The seeds don\'t taste too bad, but OJ tastes much better.)    For about 1 hr I felt mildly nauseous.  Not too bad, like a really mild stomachache.  I kept drinking OJ & also cola, it seemed to help to drink something carbonated.    At about 1 \xbd hrs, I started to feel a little something.  I felt generally happier.  Nothing too intense, but definitely an attitude that I wish I could have all the time.  I was playing a computer game, waiting for effects (and for my wife to get home).  While playing, I turned to look out the window at our garden and was amazed at how cool all of the flowers looked.  They didn\'t look any different than normal, it was simply that I appreciated them more.  I also started to get slightly antsy... I\'d get up fairly often, which was good since there was still some slight nausea, so it was good to keep refilling my drink.    By around 2 hrs, my wife came home with some friends and I was starting to fully feel all of the effects.  I was slowly becoming very controllably happy.  It was not a mad rush of \'Oh my God, life is so great\' like MDMA, but rather a slow approach of happiness.  I liked this way a lot better than the mad rush.  Along with this, I also had some slight mind-racing, but also amazing lucidity.  My mind could not stay focused on one topic too long, but I seemed to have incredible insight while on whichever topic.  Even now, looking in retrospect, my thinking seemed much clearer.  One example: we were listening to Edie Brickell\'s \'Circle\', and my wife asked me about what I thought the song meant.  Well, it\'s a fairly direct song, but still I would normally have said, \'I think it means such-and-such, but maybe she\'s also trying to say blah, blah blah...\'  Instead, I just summarized the whole thing in one really succinct sentence that made perfect sense & seemed really accurate.  Lastly, I also noticed time dilation.  Sometimes I would just be stuck in a moment, with plenty of time to contemplate about it.  We were watching a movie that was excellent to heckle and still enjoy, and it seemed like the moments of laughter just didn\'t end.    As time went on, all of the effects above just intensified, but never became too much.  I think it was the perfect dose for me, although with seeds it\'s hard to know an actual dose.  At the peak, I also saw some slight visuals, but never really much, and no improved sound appreciation.  Sound seemed louder and light brighter, though.  Even though I was not at all hungry (even though I hadn\'t eaten in a while), taste was more intense.  I had this spicy rice dish and I could still taste the starchy rice taste, even with all the hot spices everywhere.    The happiness and mind-racing seemed to come in off-set waves.  That is, I would start to feel happy, then as the happiness \'peaked\' I\'d start to feel my mind racing a bit (but not too much).  Then as the racing peaked, the happiness faded.  Then for a while, I felt sort of normal.  But, then the whole cycle would start again.    I mostly came down around 8 or 9 at night, but the lucidity stayed with me for the rest of the night.  In fact, I met up with a friend who is sort of a drinking buddy.  We went out to drink at around 10pm.  I felt totally \'sober\' by then, but still my thinking was extra clear.  We had a few drinks, and I didn\'t get drunk at all.  I got more happy & chatty (the good parts of being drunk), but I never got intoxicated.  I have to believe it was because of some lingering effect of the seeds.    Overall, it was an AWESOME time, and none of it was ever too intense.  From reading other folks, I think that it was because I found the right dose.  The only downside, which I didn\'t mention above, is that I was burping a lot in the first hour or so, and that I had bad gas for about the next two or three days."
6328,The Jungian Shadow,Uv1,"Feb 18, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"This was one of my most interesting and frightening experiences. At eight O\'Clock in the morning, I begin by drinking the extract of 7 HBWR seeds. The seeds were crushed and soaked overnight in tap water. (Note that Finnish tap water is much cleaner and has less chlorine than in most other countries) In just about half an hour since this, I feel an upset in my stomach. I set still, and the discomfort never gets too distracting. During the first hour I have many associations in my mind, most of them provoked by the music, Peyote by O Yuki Conjugate.    At about half eleven (T+2:30) my thoughs were \'lost\', as when the two halves of the brain are submitting different signals and fighting over  which one to process. I get bored, the seeds don\'t seem to be having any significant effect when they should, and I smoke some cannabis at this point. It was a small amount of Indica hashish, perhaps 0,15-0,2g altogether. Very soon I noticed the heavy physical feeling, and was a bit surprised how fast it hit me. I went back inside and first started reading a book, then watching tv but I could not concetrate on neither of them.    I moved to sit in front of the mirror to look at myself. There was myself as an old person, very different from what I am now. There was bitterness, conservatism, dislike of many things I have loved. Still manageable. Then I saw the Nazi propaganda chief Goebbels. I terrified because he and I were too so similar. Only the outlook made me realize the ideological connection. There was a fascist in me, and had always been, but only working in my subconcious. I could not run away from what I saw. I sought comfort from everything, hoped that something would offer me a safe glimpse of normal reality. But no, there was fascism in every single object and thought I had.    I smoked more pot a while later (at T+3:30). I let loose of my thought and set to dwell on the vivid scenery the music created. All this while the image in the mirror had been troubling in the back of my mind, but it no longer was an acute crisis. I decided watching Rocky Horror Picture Show was just fit for the comedown phase. It was a bit disturbing, after all, but I enjoyed it as always. The altered state slowly faded by 4 O\'Clock (T+8:00).     I do not know in what relation the entheogens attributed for my insights. I hardly can say if I\'d sat down and looked at the mirror totally sober those same things had been seen there. I have taken LSA seeds, from this batch and with this exact same preparation method several times before, with good response. Cannabis seems to have good synergy with LSA. The dominating substances were the cannabinoids, but the lysergic acid amides contributed the \'trippy\' aspect for the experience. What it has made me afterwards? I got in contact with the parts of me that I\'ve often overlooked. In the long run this has been a positive improvement."
6033,Chicken Puke for the Soul,Catfish Rivers,"Feb 6, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I have had several encounters with HBWR, usually amounting to a pleasant, albeit subtle, LSD-like activation. The dosage for these experiences varies, but most often was between 15-30 seeds. I figure that those batches were pretty weak. This particular batch of seeds, however was claimed to be \'super-potent.\' They were still covered with the brown fuzz, which I did my best to scrape off while trying to keep my eyes from crossing. What a pain in the rear it was, but I tried to make a meditation out of it. Next I washed them off with hot water and started to chew them very thoroughly. Eleven seeds were finished within ten minutes and washed down with a glass of water.     I had eaten chicken earlier. That was a mistake, I decided as I was sweating back waves of nausea. I was certainly intoxicated. I was feeling pretty sedated lying on the cool bathroom floor, wanting to nap. But then I had to bust a gut, the pressure suddenly rising in my stomach. My mind grew chaotic, bizarre thoughts forming and unforming in a haze of nausea, where am I? Blargh. Blargh. Whew. A little more blarghing. Brown froth punctuated by bits o\' chicken filled the toilet. I can see the little masticated seed husks floating in the toilet. But man do I feel on the other side of the coin! I am energized at this point. I feel as if everything has a positive blue tinge overlaying it (even the brown puke is covered by the glow). MJ smoked at this point completely wipes away lingering nausea, and boosted me to a +++. Tracers a\' plenty, breathing walls, swirling eddies of psychedelic geometry.     I hid in the basement and played guitar, watching the sun set through a tiny, shoe box sized window. It reminded me of a diorama. A tiny world view. I leave the spider webs in there, even though spiders freak me out. I am feeling too much empathy to squash anything right now. I have never really experienced anything I would call synesthaesia, but I swore that the sunlight falling across my face was dictating the melody I was noodling with on the guitar. I felt like a rock god, Queztoguitahro. I rode this wave length for about 7 hours, playing guitar and drums, until I was back to baseline. Drank some GBL, 4 ml mixed in juice for sleep. No hangover next day. I feel somewhat lighter, with less of a burden on my mind. Puking usually flushes out my spirit...blargh."
5502,No-Barf Sublingual Technique,iJoe,"Jan 17, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Just thought I\'d report an \'alternative\' form of ingesting HBWR seeds.    My first HWBR trip was amazing. In my first report, I compared the experience to MDMA -- in that it presented me with wave after wave of a kind of almost unbearably delirious happiness for about 3 hours (6 seeds ground up in water & chewed & swallowed immediately). My second trip was marred by nausea and wretching (8 seeds ground and made into a tea -- bleecch!), and after that night, I was reluctant to try HBWR again.    Then I had an idea. Considering LSA dissolves in water, then perhaps it can be absorbed sub-lingually, in the same way that LSD-25 and salvinorin-A are administered. My intent was to prove that I could absorb enough LSA without having to actually swallow the seeds. And believe it or not, it worked! Here\'s some notes from my experiment, followed by my conclusion.    7PM Saturday -- I mash 4 seeds with a hammer and a rock. I put the powder in a shot glass and add a teaspoon of cold water -- stir. Five minutes later, I add a squeeze of lime juice and some sugar, stir, and shovel that whole mess into my mouth. It takes some getting used to to have a mouth full of seed grit. The seeds have no noticeable taste (thank god). I can only hold onto the mixture for 15 minutes, but I\'ve already noticed a kind of light buzz, and a change in how I focus my thoughts. After spitting out the slurry, I enjoy a light, sedated feeling, very pleasant -- time is going by fast, then slow, then fast. The music is extremely enjoyable. My heart is racing, and my thoughts are positive. After an hour, I am able to go about doing chores etc.    11PM -- I grind up another 6 seeds. I want to see if LSA can be \'boosted\' withough losing effectiveness entirely. This time I add a couple of teaspoons of water, then a tablespoon of orange juice. The lime juice I added last time seemed to make my mouth salivate a bit much. I then hold the seed grit in my mouth for about 15 minutes. This time, within 5 minutes, I start to notice cartoon buddha CEVs, and I think to myself, holy shit, this is it.    The sedation is very strong. I can see why people would classify this plant as an intoxicant as opposed to a psychedelic. I think it\'s a little of both, actually.    For about 3 or 4 hours I am just lying there, wide awake and yet dreaming. Spirits enter the room, then leave. I finally start to gather my senses together, and I realize the radio has been on the whole time, and I vaguely recall having heard the new P.J. Harvey and liking it a great deal, even though I can\'t recall a single note of it. I get up, my stomach is fine. No puking! 5AM I kind of go to sleep.    7PM Sunday -- having one more night to kill, I decide to use up my remaining HBWR seeds. I take 9 seeds, mash them down in the same way, add a little water, a little juice, and then hold the results in my mouth for about 20 minutes (you get the idea). An hour after spitting out the seeds, I feel very very relaxed, but my mind is working \'normally\', and I decide a glass of wine would probably top off the relaxative effects (I\'m normally so sick at this stage that I can\'t drink or eat anything).    Then I suddenly realize, I cannot walk without staggering! I\'m slurring my words, and then I\'m laughing at everything. Wow, that hit me hard and fast. I continue drinking wine and smoking pot, and I am getting so wildly intoxicated. I feel so good, and I realize that I\'ve only drunk 2 glasses of wine. The waves of gentle happiness are crashing over me, and there\'s dreams and I\'m talking directly to friends from long ago and far away, and they\'re answering me. I\'m seeing double, and I need to lie down. There are tracers everywhere, and when I close my eyes I instantly start dreaming -- sleep and wakefulness are merely a function of eyelid position. My body is so relaxed, and seems thankful that I\'ve made the decision to just say hell with it, let\'s get blitzed.    I came to about 4 AM, and I felt pretty good, a little groggy and over stimulated, but none the worse for wear.    Conclusion:    I believe that sublingual absorption allows me to experience the very pleasant intoxicating effects of HBWR without the nausea. I simply take my normal dose and add half that amount (eg: if I normally take 6 seeds swallowed, I use 9 for this method). I Grind the seeds as finely as possible, almost to a powderlike consistency. Then add a teaspoon of water, and a teaspoon or more of juice. Wait 5 minutes. Pour into mouth (including all the seed grit). DON\'T SWALLOW any of it. Swirl the mush with the tongue every once in awhile. Hold for 15-30 minutes. Spit out. Go lie down, relax, have a good time."
5377,Love Potion,Jay,"Jan 14, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"My eagerly anticipated package came at about 3:00, right as my mom came home. \'What\'s this?\' she asked. \'Just a stupid toy...\' I said. She probably thought it was a sex-toy or something.    I went right to my room and got my equipment. A razor, tweezers, and a candle. I poured out four batches of eight seeds and went to work scrapping them. Once I got as much of the white crust off as possible, I held them each briefly over a flame, one by one.     Later, at 5:00 PM three friends and I put our seeds in our mouths. I chewed mine up as much as I could, and kept chewing as the unpleasent, but not horrifying seeds started to naturally get absorbed into the rest of my mouth\'s fluids.    I was amazed at how fast these seeds kicked in. It usually takes me an hour to feel acid kicking in, but after about 15 minutes I knew it was working. Another 30 minutes and I felt like I was stoned off pot, but much more alert.     This feeling progressed rapidly for a couple hours. It was strange how subtly but quickly the trip went from a stoned feeling, to a TRIP feeling. Like I was high on pot, and before I knew it I was high on something else.    Around the time this switch took place, we were all in an icecream shop to use the bathroom. At the beginning of the experience I felt a little bit nausious, but I didn\'t need to puke. I stupidly thought it\'d be safe to eat a doughball (I was hungry since I fasted all day prior), and about 30 seconds after eating it my trip turned to hell.    I felt totally miserable and sick and thought to myself, \'this is a really stupid, crappy drug.\' The feeling got worse and worse, and I started to realize I needed to puke. I rushed to the bathroom and immediately hurled. I absolutely HATE vomiting, and it\'s much much worse under the influence of a psychedelic. I puked a little more a minute later, and all of a sudden I was thrusted into euphoria. I felt absolutely great. In two seconds I went from feeling totally miserable (I was actually contemplating calling my mom and telling her I had food poisoning), to feeling great.    This whole trip wasn\'t really cutting it for me though. It wasn\'t the drug\'s fault, but I just wasn\'t satisfied with what we were doing. My girlfriend decided that we needed a weekend apart, and this was really getting to me. I missed her terribly, and knew that something was wrong. I was withdrawn from the group and my surroundings, really only interested in thinking about her and myself.     I believe that any tripper should follow his instincts and do exactly what he thinks he should do (short of stepping in front of busses), so I excused myself from my friends and their pseudo-intellectual babble.     It was about 9:00 PM I started walking, wondering what to do. I wasn\'t supposed to do it, but I HAD to see my girlfriend. Otherwise I would have gone home and been miserable. I called her cellphone, but it just rang for about three minutes. I started crying, desperate for a way to find her. I called her house, and her mom told me she was seeing a play at her school - but somehow I already knew this.    Everything instantly clicked. I realized what our problem was. She was very much in love with me, and I was very much in love with her. The problem was I was never SURE of my love, I always thought there was something wrong with it. I doubted it somehow. I never really showed her I loved her. I told her, but that wasn\'t enough. She SHOWED me, but I never returned it. Of course she was trying to somehow become less dependent on me. She was in love with someone who didn\'t seem to reciprocate.    I sprinted four blocks to the bus stop, and just made the bus. I found her school downtown, and they let me in for free to see the last of their play, \'West Side Story.\' I sat in the back, not very interested in the amatuer effort. During the standing ovations I snuck out and waited near the exit where I could see everyone leaving, but they couldn\'t see me.    After a few minutes of slowly progressing play-goers I saw her leaving with her friend. I didn\'t hesitate. I quickly walked up to her, and on the steps (we were surrounded by other people) I tapped her on the shoulder. She looked at me and was at first shocked, but she could see the emotion in my eyes and we so romantically and amazingly embraced. I couldn\'t help but crying. Her friend got us to my girlfriend\'s car. In the backseet I told her everything I figured out. I had conquered my own demons, and I had my chance to SHOW her I love her. That\'s exactly what I did. She was very happy I found her and did what I did. She missed me just as much.    Now our relationship is super hunky-dorie... and I must say that without the HBWR, I probably wouldn\'t have had the guts, emotional clarity, and creativity to do what I did.     Okay, sorry about all the sappy stuff, but it was what my trip was all about, so it\'s important.     Here\'s some general stuff about the experience: The coming up is much more pleasant than LSD\'s onset, mainly because it\'s faster, smoother, and more certain. The peak wasn\'t nearly as intense. I was down by about 1:30, so it didn\'t last as long as acid either. I experienced no hallucinations, although I could force some visuals. This is no LSD. On LSD I could look at a landscape and see millions of mouths in the plants opening and closing for breathing. It\'s still an amazing drug, however, exspecially considering how easily obtainable it is.     Although it\'s superficial in a sense, the visuals that come from acid are to me an important part of tripping. It just makes it mind-blowing, and in a way makes the mental trip more profound because I feel more removed from everyday reality, and better able to see it objectively. That\'s my only real disappointment with HBWR."
4979,Woodrose Ecstasy (My First Time),iJoe,"Jan 10, 2002",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I dosed on six seeds. Removed the woody coating, crushed and coarsely chopped with a chefs knife, swirled the seed chunks in a cup of cold water for a minute. Then I drank the whole thing down, spooning the residual seed pulp into my mouth, chewed and swallowed it. Tasted very plant like -- reminded me of the way chemical lawn fertilizer smells. Followed by 1 bong hit.    First effects were noticed within half an hour -- I noticed a speedy kind of lightness in my  body, and soon my limbs were very heavy. I kind of felt this very bright energy inside me, as if the plant spirits were sprouting from the seeds and coursing through my veins.    My spirit guides started outlining the plan for the evening: you have ingested 6 seeds. The first three will act individually -- seed 1 will give you plant perception so that just for tonight, you will experience what the woodrose plant experiences. Seed 2 will help you remember a particular incident in which you were hurt as a child. Seed 3 will allow you to ask six questions of the Ally. Seeds 4,5, and 6 will act together to bring you the healing you have requested (the relationship with my life partner has been strained as of late, because of my angry and destructive behavior and attitude, and I had prayed a couple of days before, for some kind of release, some kind of healing, so that I would not be angry anymore and I could heal my relationship).     By the end of the trip, these had all come to pass.    The spirit guides then suggested I focus my energy on my partner; I gave her a massage, and already, at about 35 minutes into the trip, I was becoming aware of my whole body. I could feel every muscle and organ and with my mind\'s eye, I could calm tensions. I also could locate my partner\'s tension just by closing my eyes; on my eyelids was a map of her body, replete with zones of tension and energy over and underflux. When I was finished with her massage, she was lying there utterly relaxed. I felt happy.    Next the plant spirit talked to me. It had the voice of an impatient elder. It said, okay, ask me your questions, but hurry up, you only have five minutes. So I asked my partner if she had any questions, which she did. So she asked me a question, the ally would answer in my mind, and I would recite the answer. After the sixth question, the ally said \'No more questions. Now be still!\'    At this point, around an hour into the trip, my limbs were so heavy and achy that I could no longer stand up. So I crawled into bed. But the music was all wrong (Laurie Anderson), so I just turned it off and listened to my partner breathe instead. At this point, I noticed that my throat and stomach were constricted, and had it not been for the bong hit I would probably be very ill.    I closed my eyes and I felt my being gently but forcefully sucked into a very pleasant bubble like enclosure. And I just floated there for some time, until I became aware of a dull body ache -- the ache was especially pronounced in my limbs, my hands and feet. My guides told me to practice yoga style breathing and relaxation, and with a little effort, I was able to \'relax\' the ache away. And once my body became comfortable again, that\'s when the waves of ecstasy started hitting.    When I say \'ecstasy\' I mean this experience felt very much like one of the five times I\'ve participated in MDMA ceremonies -- only much more intense!    I was carried on wave after wave after wave after wave of somatic, psychological, and spiritual bliss. I felt such empathy for the people around me, and I felt love and compassion for people that I had previously mistrusted who had tried to be my friends (this modern life is so good at creating isolated and mistrusting humans). At the peak of the ecstasy waves, I felt an electricity throughout my body, and I felt healed and this great relief deep in my soul. At this point, I could see a dim outline of the ally, swirling, dignified and grand in my bedroom. I offered my thanks and praise and humble gratitude. I think I would have offered tobacco were I able to stand up.    It was 2 AM. The trip had started about 10PM.    The remainder of the time, I slipped in and out of sleep, kind of like a feverish delirium. I would wake up from a trance with an unknown word on the tip of my tongue or some vague recollection of some really great idea that had slipped my waking intelligence.    At 4:30AM I took another bong hit, which curbed the still burgeoning nausea. At 5AM I began reading a magazine, and not quite understanding what the words meant, I put it down.    At 6AM I crawled back into bed.    I woke at 7:30AM with severe nausea (so severe I couldn\'t even get my bong lit), and I had to go to the toilet to gag and wretch, after which I felt better. I had been informed early, by my guides, that puking was actually purification, part of the healing process.    I felt a bit groggy all day, but I also felt that something had changed in myself -- I felt free and clear.    So far this week I have been happy, joyous, and free. I plan on participating in HBWR at least once every season, just because it was so purifying and enlightening.     I would suggest that people who try HBWR (and these other plant spirits), please respect the Ally, and be courteous -- the Ally doesn\'t want to be our entertainer -- it wants to help us with our struggles. Approach it as you would approach any traditional healer -- with a good heart, good intentions, and a gift (tobacco, food, water etc, or try growing the plant yourself)."
3682,Hawaiian Breezes,Croc_HunterDM</A,"Dec 25, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Aloha!    I am your average psychedelically enhanced college student, and I tend to view mind expanding experiences as beneficial to my education.  Plenty of times in the past I had heard of people taking seeds to trip off of an LSD-like chemical, but I never heard more than rumors.  It wasn\'t until I did serious searching on sites like Erowid that I found out more about LSA (lysergamide), LSD\'s legal cousin.  I hunted around for information and finally settled on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, because they had a great reputation and seemed to be easier to use than regular morning glory seeds.  A friend of mine knew where to get some, so I got some seeds and compared them to pictures up on the web.  They looked legitimate, so I carefully removed the fuzzy coating of the seeds (which causes nausea) and crushed them open with a pair of pliers.  I then chewed the five seeds up a little and washed them down with a little bit of orange juice.  No problems at all in dosing, just make sure that the seed is opened up a little, as they\'re literally rock-hard and impossible to chew unless broken.      My events for the evening had gotten cancelled, so I fully intended to enjoy this new method of tripping.  I grabbed my pipe and some herb, but I thought it would be better to wait until the effects set in.  I dosed at around 8pm, and then got on the computer and chatted until 10pm, which is when it really started kicking in.  HBWR seems to have a 2 hour waiting time, unlike most other substances which take an hour or so.  At 9:30 my tummy started to get a little ticklish.  I had eaten not too long before dosing, but hadn\'t had too much food.  Still, I suddenly felt the urge to vomit.  I dashed to the closest bathroom down the hall, a single, and was turned back because someone was in it.  I actually should thank this person, because I think I would have thrown up easily.  The nausea was certainly there, but it was more managable than what you get on DXM for example.  I am very glad I didn\'t puke, because of what was to come.    By 10:30pm I was seeing brilliantly vibrant colors, a whole spectrum in shining brilliance!  It was as if I were immersed in a rainbow.  The computer began to bore me, even though it was melting and the monitor and keyboard started to turn into a liquid.  I went for a walk, and reaching a safe spot, I lit up.  By now I was really feeling the effects, and seeing magnificent tracers along with the continuous flow of colors.  I had a lot of fun with my flashlight and a laser pointer, because I had my own personal light show.      Besides the visual effects, I was also very giddy and laughed a lot for no reason.  I feel that anyone else who wouldn\'t necessarily be into drugs would have a very hard time controlling themselves on LSA.  My mind flew about at astonishing speeds.  Overall my thoughts were jolly and pleasent, I thought about old pets, friends, and life in general.  While smoking I kept thinking that I was inhaling ash, but rather my mouth was just not used to feeling all tripped up and having smoke in it.  I had to keep reassuring myself that my pipe had a fresh screen and no ash was coming out of my end.  Around midnight I took my usual ginkgo biloba pill (wonderful for improving the memory) and one Actifed cold and sinus pill.  I knew how hard it was to get to sleep on acid, and I wanted to sleep eventually that night, so a powerful sedative was needed.  About half an hour later my trip took a turn for the sleepy, but it was still very intense and psychedelic.  I went to sleep at 3am and woke up the next morning very early, around 7:30am, still tripping.      The only downside, as I see it, is that the seeds cause constriction in the veins, especially in the legs.  This basically leads to cramping, making walking somewhat difficult but bearable.  Stretching alleviated the pain for a few minutes at a time, but I found it to be most uncomfortable, and the cramping continues now a little bit, two days after the experience.  Alcohol will reverse the pain of this nasty side effect, apparently.  I got mildly drunk the next night and noticed that the cramping was gone very rapidly.  So for my next trip on these seeds, I\'m going to get mildly drunk once the trip sets in and see if that prevents the cramps.  In any event, I see alcohol as more dangerous and destructive than \'deadly drugs\' and I would advise caution when mixing it with any psychedelic.    Overall, I have ranked this my single best trip ever!  I won\'t compare it to specific drugs, but it was most psychedelic thing I ever managed to accomplish.  I took 5 seeds, and was told that was comporable to one hit of acid.  I disagree with this.  Maybe I got really good seeds, but for the effects I had, 5 seeds is very potent.  The whole time I felt warm and comfortable, and not very chemically or having a load on the body.  The LSA is all natural, and I think it came into my body better than refined LSD ever did.  The whole trip had a more \'natural\' feel to it, and for the last two days I\'ve been thinking about native peoples who have ceremonial use for natural psychedelics, including HBWR."
112592,"Three Days Affected, Mentally and Physically",Alice A,"Feb 17, 2022",H.B. Woodrose (extract),"LSA - an Underrated Experience    Let me start out by saying that the LSA experience as a whole has many different effects, and just like other psychedelics these can be both positive and negative. It seems strange to me how so many wildly different interpretations of the LSA experience exist, which is why I really felt inclined to write an extensive trip report.    I was with a friend, and in a somewhat impulsive mood we decided to try LSA. The LSA we had was in the form of tablets, (legal and store-bought) with 275 mg of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose extract in each tablet. The recommended dosage was one tablet, but a lot of users reported trying two. The maximum ""safe"" limit was two tablets in a span of 24 hours. So in the end, I decided to take the risk and take two, and my friend took one. We had both eaten roughly the same amount of food about two hours earlier. My expectations were to experience something vaguely psychedelic, maybe music would be nice, or some body tingles. But initially, I honestly felt nothing.    I think it had been more than an hour when we decided to smoke a joint. When we got back inside, we definetely both felt some kind of body high. It was pretty hard to distinguish from placebo or just a powerful joint, but we both have a pretty high tolerance for weed so something was definetely going on. We watched a bunch of shows and videos at this point, and I felt a slight disappointment that nothing else was happening. I did feel pretty good and comfy physically, so I decided to embrace that this was all it was going to be.    Around that point things started to get a little bit strange though. The first thing I noticed was that time slowed down drastically. We watched two episodes of equal length, yet the second felt at least twice at long. I went to the bathroom, and to my surprise I noticed my pupils were extremely large. I was also having a lot of trouble staying focussed, understanding the plot, or the jokes, which I didn\'t quite enjoy. I felt a little bit relieved when we stopped watching, so I could settle a little bit in the changing experience. We started listening to some music, which was very pleasant.    I was having periods of high energy and periods of relaxation, similar to what I can experience on shrooms. At my most energic point I felt like dancing, which I did; but sadly that\'s when the vasoconstriction started to affect me. I think vasoconstriction is by far the biggest negative aspect of LSA. My legs were sore, and my body felt very tense because of it. I also experienced a very strong physical rush; this would alter between total euphoria and the feeling of going ""too hard""; heart pounding, sweating, etc. These sensations during the ""active"" peaks felt extremely similar to MDMA, except for the fact I couldn\'t walk or dance.    After listening to some music, I started becoming extremely relaxed. My motor control was long gone by this point; even though I felt very clear minded and coordinated, my body responded as if I was very drunk. I felt very clear minded and coordinated, my body responded as if I was very drunk. This was kind of funny and the heavy feeling increased the bodily euphoria, but made it hard to do much except sit around. We finally decided to go sit on the balcony and smoke some more. On the way there I felt iffy, but once we lit the first joint I think the LSA only ""really"" started to kick in. Conversation went slowly at first, but once we got into it, both talking and listening became very euphoric. While listening to my friend talk I could really feel those calm, content and loving feelings comparable to MDMA. I also felt very energized again. We sat there for what felt like hours; but in reality I think it was around 40 minutes.    Once we were back inside, I completely melted back into the relaxed state. We listened to a lot of music and continued to have very good, deep conversations, occasionally switching it up with some fun. I\'ve already made the comparison with MDMA a few times, but strangely the altered perception of music on LSA, to me, felt exactly the same as on MDMA. We listened to a lot of techno, and only at this point I started noticing my first visuals. Even though LSA isn\'t a very visual psychedelic, it definetely does some interesting things. For one, while listening to music, I could see ""dancing"" shapes if I closed my eyes, moving together with the music. The same thing happened if I closed my eyes and experienced physical sensations such as drinking tea, or getting a massage.    I started experiencing a lot of third eye visuals; my physical world looked normal, but the ""projected"" layer over it was filled with colours and shapes and beautiful patterns. The only actual ""traditional"" visuals I experienced were the breathing of certain images and patterns. In contrast to other psychedelics, focusing on something actually made it less trippy; it was everything in the background and in the shadows that looked different. In general, there were little to no distortions, but the general visual aesthetic did feel very different. I can only describe it as somewhat dark, yet very colorful and warm.    At this point we were at least 6 hours in, and we decided to go for a final walk before my friend would return to his house. Sadly the vasoconstriction got to me again, and during walking my legs gave in. So we decided to just sit around on the street and had some more great conversations. During all of our talks, and when I was thinking by myself, I experienced a lot of conceptual thinking and the feeling of total clarity. I got a brand new and refreshing look at a lot of things that I had been struggling with and become sad and frustrated over. Despite the fact that we were both still tripping, we decided to call it a night and get some sleep. My said our goodbyes and I went back to my house by myself.    Ironically, just as I was getting ready to chill in bed, I felt another surge of energy come on, and this time it may have been the strongest. I feel like this point was my actual peak; everything before was only the come up. The timing frustrated me since it was already very late at night, but I decided to get my laptop and listen to some music. Listening to music was absolutely fantastic, and brought my into a trance-like state, again, comparable to MDMA. To my frustration, my heart was pounding a little bit and I couldn\'t lay still, even though mentally I was starting to feel pretty tired. This is the point where I realized I had taken too much; I wasn\'t going to get any sleep that night.    When I finally accepted my fate of being awake, I decided to just pull through and entertain myself. Watching random youtube videos and listening to music was amazing; I had strong feelings of love for random strangers and very random things. Occasionally I would get out my phone and just look at pictures or people I love, which sounds strange now but it felt amazing. I would end up in short and confusing hallucinations, similar to high dosages or comedowns of MDMA; I would think I was in a certain room, until I realized I wasn\'t, at which point I would see things as they were again. Being on the internet was very confusing because of this, as I would regularly open links, and finding myself on a totally different website, even though it was actually the correct one. Overall just a lot of total bliss and euphoria, but my body wasn\'t really having it anymore. I easily pulled through the whole night.    In the morning, I actually had an appointment; I finally wasn\'t tripping anymore at that point, but I experienced what I can only describe as the most pleasant and best afterglow any psychedelic has ever given me. During the whole day I felt very content, peaceful, inspired, accepting and loving. Colours seemed way brighter, people seemed friendlier, I just felt optimistic and great. This effect was actually very strong and distinguishable from a ""normal"" good mood, and lasted for about 2 days. My altered perception of music lasted as long as well. As a matter of fact, the extent of the afterglow didn\'t really strike me until it finally passed after a couple of days the extent of the afterglow didn\'t really strike me until it finally passed after a couple of days, bringing me back to normal.    So overall I spent a good three days being affected by the LSA; both mentally and physically. The downside to this was that my body kept feeling very sore, and I couldn\'t walk long distances. Thankfully, this resolved itself as my body slowly regained normal balance. In general I haven\'t read a lot of experiences like my own; but I have seen a few that have felt this same long during, spiritual afterglow. As for the vasoconstriction, it was extremely uncomfortable, and despite all the positive effects, I won\'t dose this high again, for the sake of my body.    Luckily, my friend, who had half my dosage, had an equally positive and insightful trip, with a lot less complications. In hindsight, I feel like this strange, unappreciated drug has impacted me almost as much as my first psychedelic experience, or my first MDMA experience. It really helped me look differently at things and feel things I forgot I could feel. I think it\'s more powerful than a lot of people (including myself) realize, just because there\'s hardly any visuals; but the experience is so much more than visuals."
100022,My New Friend,Geurry,"Jan 19, 2022",H.B. Woodrose,"I had read a great deal about HBW and LSA before I decided to give it a try. I have a great deal of experience with LSD as I\'ve eaten the equivalent to over 1000 hits in various forms from liquid to crystal to paper (as well as salvia, lotus, kratom, cannabis and mushrooms-psilo and fly agaric). Having consumed so much Lucy I figured I\'d see what the fuss was all about.     I got Morning Glory seeds online and began to explore LSA\'s teachings. My first MG experience was good; subtle and pleasant but not what I expected. The effects were similar to acid but not as intense or consciousness rattling. I found that the amount of MG seeds it takes to get past my \'normal\' was simply not worth the time and effort so I was off LSA for a while. Then through some more reading I discovered HBW seeds and got excited to give LSA another try.     Experience 1: I got 50 seeds online and began the testing phase. I started with 5 seeds as most said it was beyond threshold to a medium dose. I felt no discernible effects. I started with 5 seeds as most said it was beyond threshold to a medium dose. I felt no discernible effects. I waited a few days then tried again this time with 10 seeds. A noticeable difference! Still not what I was looking for in an analogue to LSD. At least with 10 seeds I began to feel rising energy waves like that in the come up with Lucy and slight visual light anomalies, but nothing more than that for about 3 1/2 hrs.    Experience 2: A few weeks later I had all but forgotten about my seeds and found them while cleaning my music area.     I decided to give it another try as I had the next day off and felt I had earned a little reprieve from 3rd dimensionality. With Morning Glory I had made cold water extractions since the seeds were easy to crush in a coffee grinder, but since I had simply chewed and eaten the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I thought why not grind them up and put em in capsules? So I took 20 seeds this time and ground them to a powder in the grinder and made capsules. It filled about 2 and 3/4 OO size.    Within the first 30 minutes I felt the rising energy waves all throughout my body.  Subtle at first then gradually stronger over the next hour and a half. Some friends came over to my house to spin Poi. I am a new fire performer and my friends are amazing at the craft so I always embrace and opportunity to flow with them. I had almost forgotten I had taken the LSA as our flowing was chilled outside on a nice spring afternoon in GA. I had eaten the capsules about 3 hours ago at this point and my friends left to go play somewhere else but one stayed behind to chat with my wife and I.    We went inside and began chatting about life and caught up on the goings on in each others lives when suddenly I realized that I had began the \'trip\'.     About 3 hrs after taking the capsules I began full on tripping. As I watched and listened to my friend explaining something to my wife I saw amazing trails coming from his arms (he is animated when he talks). Suddenly my Jazz bass and Stratocaster hanging on my wall began to undulate and slowly like the ripples in a pond vibrate out waves into the room. I had told them that I had taken LSA and not freak out if I seemed a little strange. I felt as though I had eaten 2 good clean hits of silver acid or perhaps some lower fluff. I felt incredible! My energy body was trying to show me again that we are not our bodies rather energies simply making them ambulatory. I felt all of the good vibrations of acid without all of the chemical crap most people I know dislike very much about LSD.    Over the next 4 hrs I bounced around my house from station to station; computer to play music, my garden, and finally rested comfortably on the couch with the mrs. to watch some recordings on the dvr. All the while filled with a tremendous happy up feeling. Many visuals such as seeing a really long tracer when my calico cat ran across the kitchen floor. It seemed like there were 4 or her running and then combining together again when she did and abrupt halt right turn and scared my other fat cat to the point he jumped and I caught a trail off of him!    At last 7 hrs later I felt the slide down which was very easy compared to acid. 7 hrs later I felt the slide down which was very easy compared to acid. One minute tripping the next back to normal as if nothing had ever happened. Supremely easy. I found HBW to contain all of the things I love about acid without all of the things I don\'t like about acid.     I will be exploring LSA and Hawaiian Babywoodrose Seeds further as I\'ve eaten 20 hits as my highest one time acid dose and am curious to see where LSA can take me.   Namaste brothers and sisters."
112700,A Grinder in My Belly,the rodent,"Oct 12, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"I always tried anything at least two or three times, but the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds was the only exception.     I was always had a huge interest in nature sources of psychedelics or as I call them plant based high, so when I discovered  that there was a molecule with a structure  similar to the LSD I got curious about it . The molecule was LSA (d-lysergic acid amide), and it was found in the seeds of Ipomoea Violacea, a very nice plant whit beautiful blue and white flowers. As soon as I saw it, I said to myself I have to try this seeds.     In my country the Ipomoeas seeds are illegal but when I started the research I noticed that no one ( even the cops) cares (and probably doesn\'t know) about it, in fact in 5 minutes of google searching I bought  a bag of them that I received  at my home address without any  problem.    I put some  of them in the soil. And they started to grow super-fast, this plant is a climbing one, and after a couple of months it covered all of my fence. The neighbors always compliment with me for my beautiful flowers and for the constant care I gave them, I was growing illegal psychedelic  plant in front of them, they liked it without knowing what was under their sight, beautiful sensation in to my mind.  also I ate some seeds, but I didnt feel anything. At that time I thought maybe this stuff is not for me. I just use it as an ornamental plant, and I always enjoy its view in the summer.    Years later a guy came up to me with some LSA extraction, it was placed in an oral syringe, and I bought 2 of them. I took 5 ml twice and nothing happened, than I took 10 ml at once, and I felt I little dizziness and I saw the color a bit  more bright. And thats it. I was still thinking that this drug was not active for me.     The guy who sold me the liquid told me  he had extracted the LSA from the Argyreia Nervosa seeds, I didnt know anything about this plant so I started a new reseach. I read many articles about  this seed and I discovered that if you eat the whole seed you can get a stronger affect. So I ordered 50 of them from a reliable  source  on internet.     After one week I decide to try the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I thought that if I had taken the LSA extract without feeling much, surely I could handle a high dose of seeds. That was the first mistake. The other big mistake I did was taking the seeds after the lunch.    It was a sunny afternoon of Sunday, I grabbed 10 seeds and I ate them, the taste wasnt bad not but not good. I chew them slowly then meanwhile I was waiting for the come up I read few pages of a book.    After almost one hour of reading, I started to feel tired, so I let down the book and I went to my bedroom and I fell almost immediately asleep. Here came the most interesting effect of the drug the one that actually I did not expect but I like and, honestly, was the only good effect that I had got from those seeds, the oneirogenic one. My dreams were super vivid and as colorful as they never being, I saw all this spectacular images and all this powerful psychedelic color, then something happened, I woke up and then I noticed a very unpleasant sensation in to my stomach. I felt like I had a grinder in my stomach.    I raise from my bed and I try to walk to the bathroom, but I cannot move that well. I arrive and I tried to puke but I couldnt. the colors were blinding me, I felt really intoxicated. Things got worse, my stomach was really super upset, the nausea rose at a level I had never experienced before in my life. I tried many substances but actually I never puke cause of them, but this time was different. I could not do anything, I just stood on the sofa watching the floor said to myself when is this gonna end. As soon as I move my stomach sent me painful messages, at a certain point I did answer a friend who was calling me on the phone, and I notice that I could not follow his speech, I felt I was hypnotized, I turned off the call.     After almost three hours that seem even longer, I finally puked, and it was marvelous, my super upset stomach was relief\x85 but  it did not last for too long. After few minutes I was as before. For all that afternoon I was in that state, it seems endlessly. Then I had a thought why dont you make a cannabis tea for relief of your nausea? I had some grams of high CBD hemp (which is legal in my country). I managed, with many difficulties, in the evening, to prepare cannabis tea, I drank it with some honey just to get some energy that I missed after I had vomited plus I didnt have eat anything since lunch. The hemp helped me immensely after one hour finally my stomach found peace and I went to bed.    The day after I was still a bit upset, I was constipated for all the morning  my sight was a bit too bright, I could not watch the screen of my computer for too long.    What did I get from these seeds? Well two things : first, the biggest lesson that Ive got from this experience is  that everything comes to an end, no matter how a situation is hard one time or another it will finish. And the second lesson I learned was that  cannabis is one of the greatest medicine on the planet, once again it got me healthier and I never stop to love this wonderful plant.    So I dont classified the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds as a psychedelic drug as I expect. Though I do not like this drug, I think it is a beautiful plant that I still grow in my garden.     Thank you to all of you readers and fellow psychedelic enthusiasts"
115614,Eight Seeds and No Marijuana,cycl0pz,"Aug 11, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"HWBR Trip Report - 8 Seeds and No Marijuana    Background    Have tried LSD, Mescaline, DOB, and DXM. Plenty of psychedelic experiences under my belt, however, it has been 3 years since I tripped. I remember one particular Acid trip that I had embarked on that left me incredibly scarred and traumatized, So I decided to take a long break to internalize the insights gained from that experience. Looked up John C. Lilly\'s ""Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer"" and found it insightful. My Ego can be a bitch sometimes!    Set and Setting    My brother agreed to be my trip sitter, we were both quarantined at home. Was in my room and I had access to everything I needed, eg. drinking water, toilet, bed, trippy neon lights. I\'m not a regular stoner, so I had no access to weed, and looking back at my experience, it was better without it. As I believe that weed might potentiate my experience and catapult me into a deeper level of madness.    Trip Report    12am - ingested 8 seeds, chewed for 20 mins. The taste of the seeds was actually unbearably pungent, but ingesting some lozenges actually helped me ease into it    12.30am - extreme nausea, felt the urge to vomit everything out. Incredible body load and excruciating    12.45am - after vomiting I felt an overwhelming sense of calm, love, and familiarity. It\'s like I\'ve been here before. The colors were getting majestically bright and fractal patterns were emerging in the most splendid and wonderful ways.    1.00am - full-blown trip, starting to smell and taste colors, vasoconstriction felt like overwhelming nausea.    2.00am - amazing tactile sensations and geometric patterns. Started thinking about graphs and geometry. Also had a great appreciation of math and nature    3.00am - accessed memories of my early childhood, particularly the more innocent and simpler times, feelings of awe, wonder and curiosity illuminate my vision and mind, started experiencing friendly entities. They looked funny and might I even say primitive and cell-like? haha?    4.00am - starting getting vivid biblical imagery eg, the tale of the burning bush, pillars of cloud and fire, Santorini etc. Felt overwhelmed in the best possible way descended into a perfect bliss.    5.00am - Felt safe and protected by these entities, It didn\'t feel like I was enlightened but I felt comfortable in my own skin and felt like everything was meant to be, fractal patterns were getting incredibly detailed and intricate.    6.00am - fear of death was instantly eliminated, started interacting with the friendly entities. Understood that my brain was a biocomputer, and that the programs used to run my consciousness can be overwritten. understood the importance of learning and growth    7.00am - passed out from exhaustion and bliss.    8.00am - woke up still mildly tripping, went get breakfast, appreciated food. I understood that it was the calm after a huge chaotic storm. Was grateful for my life and was glad that I was mentally strong enough to survive!    Overall, it was a wonderful trip. It\'s something I can\'t describe with words but feel deeply. I felt grateful for my family, profession, knowledge, and skills. the covid quarantine has led me into a path of deep introspection, and I\'m compelled to make the most out of it!"
114719,Terror,Anonymous,"Jun 14, 2021",Mushrooms & H.B. Woodrose,"Pretext:    This experience took place on a school night when I was 17 years old. Between ages 16-17 I was experimenting with weed, mushrooms, codeine and basically anything I could get my hands on. At the time I was also living with my parents and siblings.     Up until this point I\'ve had a handful of trips, spanning from lower doses of mushrooms and HWBR seeds (LSA) to higher doses of both but never combined. At this point I felt like I was pretty well acquainted with psychedelics but looking back I noticed that my trips were starting to become darker and I should have taken this as a warning.    I decided I wanted an intense trip so I opted to take lemon tek 2 grams of dried mushrooms, 4g of fresh mushrooms (that I picked earlier that day) as well as 5 HBWR seeds.    A majority of the trips I had were by myself (and sometimes, with my parents home) and I honestly preferred tripping by myself; I thought that Id be able to handle this experience.     I didnt have any lemons so I opted to use lime juice instead. After letting them soak for 20-30 minutes, I downed the lime juice, chewed the soaked pieces and then ate the 4g of fresh mushrooms. Once I had finished the fresh mushrooms, I chewed and ate the HBWR seeds <!-- . If youre ever considering using HBWR, please do an extraction-->  chewing and eating them whole is a nauseating experience which tends to make me feel like Ive been poisoned.     - Onset -     T: 00:20+  I started to get distinct heaviness / knots in my stomach, this quick onset caught me off guard (this was the first time I did a lemon tek) but I wasnt overly nervous. Im starting to see some minor patterns and the walls are starting to breath slightly. My mouth is slightly dry.     - Come Up -     T:00:35+    The visuals are starting to become more apparent and my body feels quite tense (but this wasnt overly uncomfortable). The head-space of a classic mushroom trip is starting to really take effect here, I decide to turn off my light and close my blinds, leaving me in a pitch black room. The visuals were opaque, but if I focused enough I could see folding, expanding, growing vines and floral patterns that enveloped the entire room.    It was at this point that I realised that this was going to be a difficult experience.    T: 01:00+    I decided to turn on the light, lay on my bed and enjoy the trip as best I could, at this point the visuals werent overly crazy but very muddled and threw off my depth perception.    The body load was strong and stoning, it felt like my torso was twisting and sound and touch was also extremely amplified. It was so uncomfortable that each movement I made would give me somewhat of a jolt.     I suddenly became aware that at any moment my parents or siblings could walk in and catch me in an increasingly intoxicated state; this made me extremely anxious.     To give you some context, my room was about 2 metres from the lounge room where my Dad was sitting and watching TV. Funnily enough, tonight was the season premiere for show called Housos (same guys who made Fat Pizza). Its a Aussie comedy that depicts domestic violence, drugs etc and my Dad had the volume turned up very loud.     I froze in fear for around 10 minutes as I was trying to figure out whether the sound was from the TV or whether my parents had found out what I was doing, were having a massive argument and were about to kick in my door to confront me at any moment.     - Peak -     T: 01:20+    I dont understand whats happening outside my door.     Is that my parents arguing?   Is that the TV?  Does he know Im tripping? Is thats why he has the TV up so loud? Is he trying to flush me out of my room?    All of these thoughts seemed entirely rational at the time and Id have a mini panic attack whenever someone would shout.     I was completely paralysed and incapable of action. I was trapped, in complete terror and the trip was in full swing. I laid on my bed, staring at the wall and right on que the HBWR seeds started to kick in.     My stomach grumbled and tightened as my visuals and head-space amplified. The muddy, breathing visuals suddenly became sharp and detailed with colourful geometric patterns not unlike LSDs visual effects.     Im starting to feel extremely cold and realised now that I need to pee really badly.     T: 02:00+    Ive been frozen in fear for a good 40 minutes.    The trip is still escalating, my visual field is covered in tracers, my mind is going insane, Im shivering and my heart-rate is through the roof. I feel like at any moment my heart is going to explode or Im going to have an aneurysm.     I decide that I need to get up and go to the bathroom; I cant wait for my parents to go to sleep. Every time I reached for the door handle Id have a mini breakdown and step away:    I cant handle this  Hes going to see your eyes, hell know that something is up and you cant handle this confrontation. Not now.    On the 5th attempt I opened the door and stepped out quietly.     I walked to the bathroom and glanced into the lounge room where my Dad was sitting (keep in mind, he was facing away from me). The ceiling seemed to be 10 meters tall and wobbling while the room stretched into the far distance, it looked like my Dad was sitting a good 50 metres away from me.     The lines that made up skirting boards wiggled and blurred in and out of focus, and the fireplace gave the room a nice, warm and flickering hue for the patterns to do their work on - I tried my best not to stare in fear of getting caught even know my Dad was facing away from me.     I made it to the toilet. The walls were covered in squiggly, colourful lines and were just as distorted as the lounge room. Being in a smaller space made me realise how intense the breathing / distortion effect was.    I got my bearings straight, checked to make sure that no-one was getting up and walked back to my room, making sure not to look at the lounge room again.    T: 02:20+    The trip is still getting more and more intense and it was at this point that it turned inward and became introspective.     Everything bad I had done, every little mistake I made and the people that I had hurt were all put on show as I laid on my bed in silence.     Why am I like this?     Even menial disagreements, arguments and the like would almost make me cry from being ashamed, I cant describe to you what sort of torment actual issues gave me in this head-space. There was no room for rational thought or sorting it out so to speak, I was only able to react to my thoughts and not analyse them in the slightest.     It was at this point that a very strange (and persisting) audio hallucination reared its head. The best way I can describe it was a tinnitus like sound that would wind up to an extremely high pitch, then quickly back down to a grumbling low pitch. This noise would change depending on my movements, my thoughts and the sounds around me and would tie in with physical sensations across my body and face.     T: 02:40+    I checked the time for the first time in hours.     Its only been 20 minutes. What I described previously seemed to go on for hours and hours and it was still continuing. The thought loops were intense and only added to the despair as well.     This is it, youve driven yourself insane and youre going to stay like this forever.    How could you ever return to a normal life after what happened tonight? After the absolute hell youve dragged your mind through?    Your friends and family arent going to be able to recognise you anymore    This was one of the few times in my life where I seriously contemplated suicide. It seemed almost impossible that I would come out of this unscathed. I thought 100% that Id at least severe anxiety or schizophrenia for the rest of my life, it felt like this head-space and physical effects would persist after the trip. The thought of suicide made me feel even more guilt as I understand that it affects the people around you so much.     For awhile I tried to cry but couldnt.     - Comedown -     T: 03:00+    My parents went to bed about 10 minutes ago. This gave me some relief as I could get up and potentially leave if I needed to get some air or a change of scenery.     I walked out into the lounge room and saw my cat there chilling on the couch. I gave her a pat and invited her into my room, we were happy to keep each other company.     I laid on my bed going through the same thoughts, it was at this point that the trip was starting to die down. When she saw that I was in agony, she would come up to my face and give me a little nudge on the nose. She would stare into my eyes and to this day I think she is some sort of old soul who was re-incarnated into a cat; she looked at me as if she understood.    It was very comforting to have a companion and I started to feel a lot more grounded.    T: 04:00+    The trip ended abruptly.    The head-space is still there (albeit less intense), but theres no more visuals and no more ringing in the ears.    Im absolutely exhausted.    I go outside to smoke a cigarette and reflect on exactly what happened.  Once I came back inside, I took 25mg of Seroquel and went to sleep at about 05:00 and slept for about 12 hours.     Its been over 7 years and I dont think I ever integrated what happened that night.     Thankfully, I think the dried mushrooms were degraded quite a bit. I imagine it would have been a much more intense experience if they werent."
100636,Body Melting,sedracer,"Jun 7, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my second experience with hbw seeds, my first was a test run and besides a few sentences to follow the introduction its the only time it will be mentioned. I read about these seeds after searching for legal ways to trip and explore the mind a little more. I built a ganzfeld experiment setup in a closet and then ordered these seeds.  \t  First trip. Seeds arrived on a monday, I promptly stripped the fur off of 8 seeds about 6pm. Soaked them in some ice cold filtered water for about 15 minutes. Took about an hour and 15 minutes for the effects to start being felt. Caused me to vomit 6 hours into the trip. Great fun but after vomiting I was exhausted and passed out. Crazy dreams did occur all night.    Second trip and the bulk of this experience entry. Planned ahead for a sunday afternoon with my gf (A) and a buddy (B) and his gf (C).   \t  Prep - Crushed the seeds, 11 each for myself and B, 8 each for the ladies. Put the seeds in water bottles with a splash of filter water and 2tsp of lime juice. They soaked for the ride \tto my friends house (approx. 30-45min). I shook them twice during the journey. Added 3-4ozs of OJ to the mix and shook well.  \t  After making the mix we all took a seat on the deck in some comfy chairs to swallow the mix. The effects hit within 10-15 minutes. A tingling starting in my stomach and radiating out my arms and legs. My body began to get heavy and totally relaxed. The girls ended up laying on the deck floor within 30 minutes. A and C both puked up the mix 45-60 minutes, I also started to puke after quickly running down some steps but swallowed it back down. My first time was great and I wanted the full effects again.  \t  90 minutes in we all landed on the couch and smoked a blunt to ease stomaches and add to the ride, by this point my body is the most relaxed and at ease that its ever been. I kept feeling like I was melting into the couch as it would warm to my body temperature. Some mild cev\'s from the tv noise, waves of color and light. I put my head under a blanket multiple times to make sure it wasn\'t the tv light and then they started to intensify and create beautiful radiating patterns.   \t  2.5 hours we were back on the deck. A, B, and C were all laying on the deck floor in the shade and I sat in a nice deck chair with my legs out across them. C was having the most intense effects, she could only manage to lay on her stomach. She was lightly moaning and humming but grinning the entire time. I think she puked 2-3 times total by now and that was all for the night. B and I spent what felt like hours watching the clouds tumble and roll, some light thunderstorms for moving around us so the clounds had tons of depth and color. Shapes and patterns constantly were appearing for me and I kept seeing birds but no else could see them. The girls demanded we order food so we ordered a pizza.  \t  3.5 hours Pizza was delivered and I could only eat one piece, it looked amazing but the smell was so powerful it put me off. No one else at more than a piece either but we would devour it a few hours later into the trip. C is still crashed on the floor as well as A, B and I go to the basement to roll another blunt. My body high is still amazing, everything I touch seems to be the most amazing thing I\'ve touched and I constantly rub them. My body high is still amazing, everything I touch seems to be the most amazing thing I\'ve touched and I constantly rub them. We came back to the deck and after rubbing my deck chair for 10 minutes I got a splinter and quit. I then gave A and C back massages to get out my rubbing addiction for the moment and to help ease some of what they called nausea at the time but later explained it as intense tingling in their abdomen that felt good but was so strong it made them feel sick. B and I are passed the stomach troubles and having a blast.  \t  5 hours in, we were all coming through the intensist parts of our trips but B and I were still rolling pretty well. My body had a light tingling sensation like they were going asleep but never hit the full pins and needles. This effect lasted the entire rest of the night for me and is what will make me eat many more of these seeds. We smoked a couple more blunts and spent the next few hours on the couch. All rambling from topic to topic talking over the tv and cutting each other off to build the story or topic further and further from where we started. We were all feeling great and reheated the pizza.  \t  7-10 hours in, still have the great body high and feel great. For the entire trip I felt like I could do anything, from stand up comedy we were watching, to explaining to our tripsitter that her degree wasn\'t going to get her far enough for the effort. Everyone was in good spirits and between B and I we ordered 400 more seeds to share with our friends. My reoccuring statement from the night was \'Why doesn\'t everyone do these?\'.    In conclusion, for the ease of access, legality, and price this is awesome in my humble opinion. I\'m not a hardcore tripper doing LSD 3-4 times, molly a couple times, and shrooms once. This is not like any of them, molly would be the closest. I had a warm and fuzzy feeling inside and my filter was totally turned off. I would ask any question and give any answer. I had read LSA has a more narcotic effect than LSD and I would say thats 100% true. <!-- If you fear puking I would try the technique of holding the mixture in your mouth like a few other experiences have said. As f-->For myself the nausea is less sickness and more disorientation. These things are intense, but not in a visual way but an emotional and physical sense.   \t  Left overs. A few things I forgot to mention and don\'t want to go place back in are that my vision while tripping seemed to be super powered. Things looked sharper and more vibrant, I did have some light sensitivity to the sun in the early afternoon but I occasionally get that sober. <!-- Also C gave me some crazy hallucination stories from her trip but I\'ll leave those for her to post. She reported multiple times while tripping that she was dying but each time she was grinned from ear to ear and laughing. After repeatedly telling her she was not dying she would laugh and say I know but I am dying and then go back to laughing.-->"
87168,Couldn\'t Get Off the Runway,safemouse,"Jun 1, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"I hoped the idea behind taking this benediction was that something paradigm shifting would happen.  That was absolutely the case when I took dear, horrible Blighty\'s Liberty Cap many years ago.  I simply cannot put into words how it jolted me into a reved up reverie of joie de vivre, empathy and imagination.  And marijuana has always been a good mainstay, even if it isn\'t a trip beyond escape velocity.      Now I don\'t wish to write HBW off, because there are so many factors.  The strain I took (grown in Thailand, said to be inferior), the method of extraction (chewed, held in the mouth for a minute and swallowed), the mood I was in (anxious, guilty), the lowish dose and the person (introspective, intellectual and a little unusual).  And it was by no means ineffective.  But I can tell you that after reading other reports I was fearing meltdown, that I seriously wondered if I would need to be locked in a room.  I knew that there was no telling what decisions I might make on it.  In the event, it was not unlike being drunk without slurring my speech or on ecstasy; which doesn\'t have a euphoric effect on me.  More a sadly sympathetic one.  It just opened me up a little. It just opened me up a little.  I was nauseous but didn\'t throw up, I found that I wanted to talk into my dictaphone about Shakespeare and Fletcher\'s play, Henry VIII, and did so for a large amount of time.  On listening back to it when sober you wouldn\'t know I was tripping and my insights are a perhaps a little more lucid than they\'d typically be.  I did realise what a line by Fletcher meant, which for years had evaded me.  <!-- When he calls the trial of Buckingham noble, he doesn\'t mean it was fair, he simply means it was grand.  It was, afterall, attended by the chief \'nobles\' of the land.  -->    I said a prayer just before the trip began, asking to be used kindly and I was.  I asked not for kicks, but for some sort of guidance.  If the guidance came, it was that drugs have a limited effect on you when you are already spouting what you truly believe in.  Whether that\'s true or not, the trip didn\'t make me into a life coach with a new approach.  I had no visuals, no enhanced appreciation or notably multiplied perspective of media, I didn\'t experience paranoia. I remained very much atypically in control of myself. I had five bars of chocolate in the fridge and didn\'t eat one, because I want to give them away, and I think that was a good litmus test of how I kept a soberesque leash on myself.  Just a thoughtful, fragile journey in which I often went and lay on my bed huddled up.  I suppose I hoped for a peak that never came.      I want to thank HBW for not traumatising me, I woke up the next morning dehydrated and \'even as a calm\'.  (One of Fletcher\'s better analogies, presumably referring to a flat sea.)  Not happy or sad, or particularly empty, and glad to find myself near the default state.  (I went to sleep about six hours after I ingested.)"
101872,To Insanity and Back Again,RastaMan,"May 29, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Nitrous Oxide,"Dose: 10 seeds  Body Weight: 90kg  Male age 36    Time: 22:37 Had H.B.W concoction after drinking ginger and honey with hot water (as I heard this helped reduce nausea) n.b. The tea was made 3-4 hours prior with boiling water so as to remove chlorine, fluoride and other chemicals then lemon juice was added to assist in the extraction of L.S.A from the seeds into solution. The concoction was then placed in two glasses. One for me and one for my cousin. We put 10 seeds in each. Which were previously ground with a coffee grinder. They had no outer husk which I would have removed if present.    After drinking the concoction and the ginger and honey tea we both had a beer. We then both had a cone of marijuana and a couple of cigerettes while we waited for it to take effect.    22:55 Starting to feel light body buzz. My cousin went outside and spewed violently for ten minutes or so. At this point I felt fine. No nausea.  22:59 Had nitrous with balloon. It was pretty cool. Similar to nitrous with LSD or mushrooms. Auditory and visual reverberating waves of fragmented input and physiological body sensation as well.  00:04 Definitely tripping now!! Colours are much brighter. Acid like sensations. Outlines of everything becoming fuzzy and less defined and appear to be shimmering and slightly moving.  00:31 Very dry mouth for last hour at least. Drinking lots of water. A seemingly unquenchable thirst.    00:37 A sensation or feeling of a deeper understanding of the universe. A feeling of being one with everything and everyone. It is becoming hard to write.  00:42 A feeling of being connected at the deepest level to everything. In a sense my entire being becoming a connected sub atomic particle level extension of the multiverse.  00:47 Still an unquenchable thirst despite drinking heaps of water. About two litres so far.     00:50 I ate a piece of chocolate... ha ha forgot how to spell chocolate. Obviously slowed cognitive function.  00:54 Had nitrous while lying on the floor. It looked and felt like I was leaving my body through a giant tunnel of eyes surrounded by fire going from my forehead up into the sky seemingly with no end.  01:29 Basic motor skills difficult at this point. Had a nitrous bulb with no balloon. It did nothing. Seemingly because I got distracted from it and didnt focus on it at all.   01:36 I can almost think myself sober and then back to tripping really hard. Things seem to change dramatically based on perception of what is in my environment. Other people, objects etc.    12:52 Well its the next day now. The last part of the trip got very dark, confusing, scary and introspective. I didnt feel like writing anything at the time. I will try and sum up what happened, how I felt then and how I feel now. Firstly  now I feel pretty scattered, very vague and still quite disconnected with myself. I finally crashed about 03:00 ish. I woke at 07:00 to go to the toilet then went back to sleep till now, nearly 1.    I didnt really feel like myself again till the next day. Thank god I did because during the trip I felt like had gone insane and would never be the same again. What I experienced between 02:00 and 03:00 I will try and explain. Up until now I had been having a great time. I felt connected to myself, the collective consciousness and the multiverse. Then at some point about an hour before I slept I felt like something went snap in my brain. At the time I feared I\'d gone insane and broken something permanently. I felt like I was going to be like that forever. I had had similar experiences a few times on LSD. Never once did I truly believe I would not be fine again after the trip ended. This trip was different though. I had had similar experiences a few times on LSD. Never once did I truly believe I would not be fine again after the trip ended. This trip was different though.    During one of these LSD experiences I became disconnected with myself and could not communicate clearly with anybody. It was weird because friends around me seemed worried or concerned that I would be in that disconnected state indefinitely. Some saying things like I\'m glad I was here at the end and Im glad I got to spend time with you before this happened others seemed to mock me and make fun of the whole thing. It was a very weird experience. I found the whole thing quite comical really. Although at the time I couldnt communicate to anybody much at all. Despite what others believed.  I never felt at any point that I would not be back to my old self after it finished and I of course was. This LSA experience even without others doubting my sanity was somehow very different.    I really was totally convinced that my consciousness, my eternal soul had left my body and was to never return. It goes against  rational thought but at the time seemed so real and very, very scary to say the least. Before I finally managed to fall asleep I convinced myself that this was it. I had gone insane and was never going to be sane again. I even said to my cousin I think thats it mate, Ive done my dash, I will never be the same again.    ONE WEEK LATER: This turned out to be far from the truth of course. I feel more myself than I have in a long time. I am happy, healthy and thinking more clearly than I have in ages. Whether my consciousness went to another dimension or it just felt like it left I\'m not sure? I was initially really keen for my next LSA  H.B.W seeds or other experience. But now I am not so keen. I think I will do it again one day. After much more research, talking to others and personal contemplation. I am certainly in no hurry to any psychedelic in the near future. A  wonderful experience overall but one that certainly had a dark confusing and scary twist at the end. It was certainly a beautiful soul caressing dance followed by an overwhelming feeling of insanity and then back again. <!-- Wow what a ride!! Definitely not for the faint hearted. Although of course for many reasons everyones experience with anything is always different. -->"
12178,Sunshine Daydream,Phish Fan,"Jan 22, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'ve had a fascination with 60\'s pop culture for a long time, extending into an interest in drugs.  I\'ve smoked pot before but I\'ve always been a bit uncomfortable breaking the law. <!--  Of course I think pot laws are ridiculous (I live in California and pot is the largest crop California grows).  I guess it\'s just a paranoia/fear thing that gets me.  I digress...I feel more comfortable doing drugs that are still legal (and fun mind you).   -->So I purchased 50 seeds for $20 online in an effort to enjoy my college years and indulge a little.      I ground up 4 seeds, soaked them in cold water, and put a little orange juice in to kill the taste.  I held that mixture in my mouth for about 25 minutes before spitting it out.  I had picked out a zen meditation CD, Grateful Dead live in Europe 72\', and one of the my new live Phish CDs, I think the Japan one, for my listening pleasure.  I turned off my lights and turned on the music.      The first thing that wasn\'t \'normal\' was me turning my head back and forth very fast.  My closet has a mirror on the outside and I became fascinated with the mirror duplicating the image out of my window.  I would sit on my bed, look to my right out my window, and then glance to my left at my mirror.  I found this activity to be hilarious.  I remember laughing but when I think back on it I\'m not actually sure if any sound was made.  It\'s more like my body laughed (hard to explain anyway).    I curled up on my bed and pulled in my blanket around me.  At this point my limbs would get really hot and then go back to normal for some reason.  At this point my body became alive and I could feel everything touching me.  Just laying in my bed I became very aroused. At this point my body became alive and I could feel everything touching me.  Just laying in my bed I became very aroused.  I actually considered pleasuring myself but I think I just forgot to.  I\'d had kind of a long day so I decided I should go to bed.      I know I had music on but I never remember hearing any of it.  The only part I remember focusing on was the Dead lyric \'sunshine daydream\' and how that had some deeply profound message to it which I\'ve now forgotten.  I drifted in and out of sleep for a few hours.  Some brief audio perception changes occurred right before I went to sleep.  At one point when I woke up I felt my blanket was a wolf out to get me.  I wasn\'t scared though (my girlfriend has a dog which looks like a wolf but is actually really sweet) so I just pet the wolf, which made it stop growling, and went back to sleep.    I woke up the next morning around 9 am feeling great.  <!-- I\'ll be filing another report this coming weekend because mom is leaving and I plan on increasing my dosage.  Also I plan on getting some lighting to increase the experience.  This was my first time with psychadelics and it was great.   -->I really look forward to doing this again soon.  Peace and love to all who read this."
89646,Intense and Powerful Spiritual Experience,Jack,"Jan 20, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Intense and Powerful Spiritual Experience    I took 7 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds with two other people, first crushing the seeds without scraping or burning them, and then letting the crushed seeds soak in flavored water overnight. I drank about 3/4 of the bottle without filtering out the seed debris.     The guys made ginger tea to deal with the expected nausea, and I smoked weed. Not a lot, about five or six puffs of a joint over the course of the evening. The guys put on 2001: A Space Odyssey to watch. I had never seen this movie in its entirety before, and I can guess that it was probably why I experienced what I did.    Smoking made the effects more pronounced in me than the guys. Smoking made the effects more pronounced in me than the guys. For the first parts of the movie, I was flying. I was very happy, happier than I have ever been before. Every emotion was ridiculously intense, but in a good way. When the movie got around to the last part, I was in outer space. I was watching a universe being born. I was connected to everything on a base level, and I felt multiple truths about the universe being revealed to me, like I was uncovering them within myself. What will be will be. The universe is its own being, and it cares less for our actions then we do for the shedding of our skin cells. This wasn\'t depressing at all, it was humbling and made me realize my vast insignificance to the grand scheme. It was the idea that no matter what happens, the universe will continue on without me; it was there at our birth and will be there at our end. It was the notion that everything is perfect as is on a massive scale, and that only we as individuals are imperfect.    When the movie finally ended, I was on fire inside. I was aware of a burning ball of energy lighting me from the inside; my essence. I wanted to go for a walk, something we had talked about since we had ingested the seeds. I wanted to see the world through these new eyes. I hadn\'t felt much nausea at all yet, but when the elevator started heading down, it started to hit me hard. One second I was leaning against the wall of the elevator thinking about how I would have to throw up in the bushes to feel better, and the next moment is the guys I was with calling my name and helping me into a sitting position. Blackout.    The scariest part of the blackout was that I came to with a very solid sense of something having happened to me spiritually while I was out. I felt like millennia had passed, like I had lived lifetimes and forgot. My first coherent thought was \'I didn\'t think I would be back here.\' It felt like I had been travelling universes and dimensions, and was suddenly pulled back through it all to my own without warning. Like I had gone away and accepted the fact of my never returning. It was terrifying and heartbreaking, because if it wasn\'t a dream (or even if it was) I don\'t remember anything, all I had was relief and (the opposite of homesick?) at being back. My thoughts immediately garbled, alternating between trying to remember what happened, remembering where I was, trying not to be sick, and my family and friends.    The guys brought me back up to the apartment, where we all sat down right where we had been. If they hadn\'t continued to talk about my blacking out, I would\'ve thought I dreamed the entire thing, leaving and everything. I became very paranoid and scared, suddenly worrying that I might die in my sleep. I was regretting the seeds simply because I realized that every time I do drugs I am putting my body at risk, and I felt guilty for doing that to the people who love me. I tried to talk through it with the guys, then remembered reading that a lot of people felt better all around after throwing up, since it became a physical and a spiritual purge. I forced myself to throw up, and voila, suddenly feeling a lot better.    We put on another movie, Maximum Overdrive, and after a little while I laid down and slept some on the couch. I came awake thinking I could still hear the guys talking and the movie playing, but when I opened my eyes in reality they had gone to bed. I called a cab, and had one of the guys ride the elevator down with me. I forced myself to puke again when home, then took some pepto bismol and fell asleep around midnight.     The next day I had a headache from where I hit my head on the floor during the blackout, and was still nauseous. I had to force myself to eat because I had almost no nutrients in me, and by the end of the day I felt a lot better and had my appetite back."
12095,Hawaiian Hell,skunk_numero_uno,"Jan 8, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"<!-- This morning I stopped at Carvel to buy myself an ice cream cone for breakfast.  While browsing around the pre-made cakes, one caught my eye with the following note scrawled on it very neatly in icing:   -->  Last night I had the most fucked up drug experience of my life.  It is really difficult to get acid or shrooms, or any psychedelic drugs where I live, so I am always looking for alternative ways to trip.  I have tried morning glory seeds a number of times with one semi-successful attempt; definitely not worth the effort of swallowing over 100 seeds.  Anyway, I read that Baby Hawaiian Woodrose Seeds are much more potent so I ordered some last week off the Internet. <!--  from the Basement Shaman.   -->The ad said that the seeds were among the finest.  I did not take this as seriously as I should have.    At about 3:00 I was on my way home from dropping my sister off.  I decided to eat the seeds, off of which I had previously scraped the fuzz.  I popped one at a time into my mouth, chewed thoroughly and swallowed.  I did this over the course of about 10 minutes.  The seeds did not really taste bad, certainly not as hard to choke down as morning glories.  By the end of the 15 minute ride home I began to get that \'Oh my god, something bad is going to happen\' feeling.  I pulled my car in and kind of staggered over to my front porch, feeling like I was going to throw up, pass out, or both.  I hadn\'t eaten anything all day and my mouth was dry so I scooped some snow off the ground and ate it to calm myself.  After a couple of minutes I felt pretty decent again and went inside.    At this point I still felt a little nauseous and it was difficult to walk.  I made it to the kitchen and drank some fruit juice.  Then I went into the living room with a bag in case I threw up.  I didn\'t have any kind of distinct hallucinations, but everything just felt weird somehow.  The TV started to make me sick so I went up to my room to lay down.  I slept for about an hour or two before my girlfriend called.  I talked to her for a bit and that made me feel a little better.    Then I went down to eat dinner.  I was not hungry but I figured I should eat something.  I was still all dizzy and it was really confusing to walk around.  It was somewhat difficult to talk too, and the light really bothered my eyes.  I could hardly answer my parents and sister when they talked to me.  I ate a small piece of chicken after chewing it for about five minutes straight.  Now I really felt something bad happening.  This began the worst part of my \'trip.\'    I dashed upstairs to the bathroom and turned the exhaust fan on so my parents wouldn\'t hear me if I yakked.  I began to hyperventilate and I bent over the sink with my head in the basin, trying to calm myself.  I turned on some cold water and soaked my face.  I started writhing around on the bathroom counter with my head in the sink.  My stomach was wrenching and I wanted to throw up but I couldn\'t.  I sat down on the floor and my hands started to get that pins and needles feeling.  It got worse and worse to the point where my hands were totally numb, but feeling pain from the inside.  I got up and ran them under cold water to no avail.  The numbness and pain began to travel up my arms.    By this time I could not move my hands with out a very strong effort.  My thumbs and ring fingers kept coming together like I had cerebral palsy, and my hands and elbows bent over and were twitching.  I couldn\'t move from my elbows down.  I was really starting to get scared.  I tried to make myself puke but I couldn\'t even straighten my finger to reach the back of my throat.  I thought I might need to have my stomach pumped.  Finally I decided I needed help.  I opened the door and called to my parents. Finally I decided I needed help.  I opened the door and called to my parents.    When my parents came up I almost told them everything.  I almost told them I wanted to go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped, but then I thought about it and figured that I really didn\'t want that to happen and I should just relax.  My mom wet a washcloth and put it on the back of my neck.  I just told her that I thought I was going to throw up and I couldn\'t move my arms.  Having someone there to talk to really helped me mellow out.  I sat on the toilet with my head between my knees and I drank a little water.    I sat there for what felt like an hour before I got most of the feeling back in my arms and I was able to move and pick things up again.  I went downstairs in the living room and watched TV for a bit.  I was kind of laughing at jokes that I knew weren\'t funny, and I\'m not sure why.  I drank a soda because I figured it might settle my stomach, but it did the opposite.  I ran upstairs to the bathroom again, but this attack was only about 1/4 of the hell I went through before.    I wanted to sleep it off at this point, but I was afraid I might puke and choke on my own vomit or something.  I laid down on my stomach on my bed and heard music from my sister\'s room.  It sounded unusually cool and I suppose if I had eaten maybe half as many seeds as I did, I could have enjoyed shit like that the whole time.  Finally I guess I fell asleep.  I woke up about 4 hours later and felt pretty much back to normal.  I had sort of a body hangover, though, and when I tried to go to sleep again I couldn\'t get comfortable.  I went down to the living room and slept the rest of the night on the couch.    I woke up this morning still having a body hangover, but other than that I was fine.  It felt good to eat.  I was supposed to go skiing today, but I decided against it.  Despite this hellish experience, I did gain something out of it.  I really love my family a lot and my parents are awesome.  They didn\'t even accuse me of taking drugs or anything and they came up right away to help me when I asked.  I am very grateful for this and everything they have done for me and am trying to think of some way to make it up to them.   Anyway, I hope this will serve as a warning to anyone wanting to take HBWR seeds.  I would recommend only eating no more than four for the first time to gauge your sensitivity.  I was taking no other drugs or herbal supplements at the time.  This was seriously the scariest drug experience of my life, even worse than my first time snorting heroin.  Several times I thought I was going to die or have permanent brain damage.  Please, if you take these seeds, BE CAREFUL.    -A friend.    ...Of course I bought the cake so I could type this story and submit it.  Hope it served everyone well! -->"
104581,I Just Wish I Had Gotten More Out of It,F,"Jul 1, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"A Good First Time    I have some experience in psychedelics, mostly research chemicals such as 25i-nbome, 25c-nbome, 5-MeO-MiPT, and MXE. Other drugs Ive taken have just been weed and alcohol. I decided to do this on impulse at about 5:10pm. I had read some stuff about H. B. Woodrose, but was kind of unsure about the hardcore nausea everyone seemed to have. Off of every other substance I have never been nauseated, so I went through with it, but instead of taking 5 seeds like I planned, I took 2 to test it.     I had eaten around 11am that day and with a small snack of chips before eating the seeds. I chewed them enough for me to describe the taste to the two guys I was with, so less than a minute. I then sat on the couch with the two and watched some Netflix. Around 5:20pm  5:30pm I started getting mild nausea. I tried not to think about it too hard, and calmed down my slowly inhaling and exhaling. The stomach ache was kind of like a bloated stomach, and I didnt want anyone to touch me. Ive had worse stomach aches, than this. This is when I realized it was starting. The TV, a nearby light switch, and a thermostat started to have a long shadow to them, from the edge of the walls to the objects. When I mentioned that to the tripsitters, is when the stomach ache went away.    As the day progressed, around 5:50pm I had mild visuals. The walls had shadows slowly moving on the edges. This was a version similar to 5-MeO-MiPT and some 25i experiences. These went away as soon as I mentioned them. One of my friends took 9 seeds a few hours before I did, and he was describing a cross stitch closed-eye visuals. I had these for most of the trip.     At around 6pm, we decided to go to that guys house. As I stood up, I felt like I forgot how to walk. I found it weird seeing everything a few feet taller than just sitting on the couch. My legs burned from possible vasoconstriction. They felt as if I had just run 5 miles without stopping. As I got in the car, I had a bag with me in case the nausea came back. It didnt luckily, and this is the last of nausea being mentioned.     Getting to his house, nothing really stuck out to me as anything greater than normal. Trees looked like normal; cars didnt have tracers or anything. Once at his house, I slowly remembered it. For a split second didnt recognize where I was, even though this was the house I had used most of these drugs in at least once. When I excused myself to go pee, I realized how actually far out I was. I couldnt recognize my face in the mirror. No visuals, but my pupils were massive. I walk out, feeling like a giant and losing my balance once or twice. Sitting on the couch was home for me. That and my boyfriend were my security blanket.     We get a movie going at about 6:30pm. I half pay attention to it, Im mostly focused on touching my skin and my boyfriend\'s. This was something I was familiar with, and it made me happy. Everything felt fun, but if anybody touched me I curled up. The rest of the night was purely tactile. No visuals. I started to think dumb thoughts around this time which I kept to myself and now I dont remember them. I didnt have any enlightening moments. I was able to carry a conversation pretty easily. I think these seeds had a massive body high for me.    Around 8:30pm when the movie was over, before we left I needed to go to the bathroom again. This struck me as strange, I had nothing to drink but water when I took the seeds. My boyfriend took me home, I was touching his hair the whole way back. I came home, had to pee again (in the span of like 20 minutes), took a warm shower, and started yawning terribly. All these yawns made me tired; I ended up asleep at 9:30pm. Around 1am the next day, is where everything gets confusing. I was lucid dreaming. I was playing out a dream in my head, and fell back asleep, slowly.    Id rate this experience a 6/10. It wasnt bad; I just wish I had gotten more out of it. But for what I took, this was fine."
104833,Nodding Off in Lysergoland,Pfaffed,"Jul 1, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Ethanolic Extraction of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds    Me:  31 year old male, 135lbs. Generally, my reactions to psychoactives are idiosyncratic. There\'s not much use if you can\'t extrapolate from them. For instance, I react badly to cannabis and MDMA, but love bufotenine and salvia. My experiences with LSD and other ergoloids are pretty typical, though (except that they are almost non-visual,) so my experience here is probably pretty representative.     Background:  Positive or neutral experiences with: BZP, TFMPP+BZP, salvia, mescaline, 5-MeO-DMT, DMT, ketamine, kratom, ghb, adrafanil, psilocybin, amanita muscaria, lsd, calcium bufotenate, ayahuasca,  nitrous oxide  Negative experiences with: 2c-C, HBWR, MDMA, cannabis    Extraction:  - 100 HBWR seeds ground to fine powder in pulses in coffee grinder to keep temps down.  - Butane blasted 4 times. Inefficiently due to clogging, but probably a superfluous step anyway.  - Seed material washed with  - Seed material covered with  <0\xbaC ethanol and stored in fridge for 2 hours.  - Decoction filtered, ethanol added to previous wash.  - Seed material covered again with  <0\xbaC ethanol. Stored in fridge for 16 hours.  - Decoction filtered, ethanol added to previous washes.  - 3g citric acid added, which was pretty pointless given the low concentration of water.  - Decoction reduced in cold dark environment of fridge (probably not necessary, as it doesn\'t seem super unstable).  - Decanted, filtered. Filtrate transparent and very, very light colored.  - Several washes of tools and equipment with several fresh everclear washes of seed matter and tools were added to filtered product. Filtrate now murkier and light brown in colour.  - Reduced at 15\xbaC in front of fan to 100mL extract.  - Result is ethanolic extract at 1mL:1HBWR seed ratio, not counting extraction loss.     Administration:  - 5ml ethanolic extract post butane blast (roughly equal to 5 seeds, not counting loss) put in plastic bullet blender.  - 4 drops Cassia cinnamon bark essential oil added stepwise and swirled over two minutes. No reaction observed. I would like to take this sublingually, but it\'s a skin irritant.  - 125mL spring water added.   - Pulsed in blender for short period of time (louching observed, of course.)    1:35pm  Started sipping product. Smells unsettlingly petrochemical, making me worry about my butane blast. First time I\'ve detected the smell in the whole process, though, so I dismiss it as cassia oil volatiles.   1:50  Alert. Tell myself that it\'s probably just the ethanol on an empty stomach or a placebo.  1:55  Nasal congestion. I get this every time from ergoloid mesylates, sometimes from ethanol. Maybe it\'s not a placebo or maybe it\'s just seasonal allergies.   2:00  Finished sipping product. Noticing enhanced visual detail.  2:06  More noticeable effects. Sedation, feeling in thighs, ergoloid style feeling in brain, desire to close eyes and drift; not strong. Shulgin +1. Initial enhanced visual detail gone. Hard to bring self back from daydreams. Some mild heartburn-like discomfort from cinnamon. Ate half a honeycrisp apple.  2:15   Hard to concentrate. Still +1. Body warm, but still feel low-key in a mushroomy kind of way. No CEVs. Nothing going on. Not interesting. Some mild swimming vision. Beginning to suspect placebo. Thinking of having caffeine.  2:25  Things feel settled. Probably the peak. Weirdly bland but definitively psychedelic state achieved. Certainly no visuals. Thinking of eating something else now.  2:35  Attempts to coax out OEVs from patterned surfaces are quite underwhelming. The suggestion feels more like mushrooms than mescaline. No buzzy energy rainbow lattices, more shadowy outlines crawling across my field of vision independent of external visual stimuli. Anyway, they can\'t be forced.     2:40  Mild desire to defecate, tiniest suggestion of nausea (may be hunger). Face looks interesting in mirror. Experience akin to low dose lsd with no change of headspace or stimulation. Feel like a higher dosage would have been better. No change in pupil size suggests placebo effects, even though the experience doesn\'t feel like a placebo. Still mild warmth and tension in jaw and thighs. Bodyload negligible, all in all certainly a MUCH more pleasant than prior experiences with HBWR seeds eaten whole (severe cramping, mental fog, depression, and anhedonia.) Ate some mint choc ice cream.   2:42  Has it really only been two minutes? I have no desire to do anything, but there\'s nothing particularly interesting about the experience either. Sex drive, my constant companion, is gone. Still, I\'m not experiencing apathy or anhedonia. Definitely psychedelic. Shulgin ++. It\'s just not interesting yet. I feel...attenuated. Sighing a lot. Breathing requires a little bit of effort. Decide not observe this but not be concerned just yet.  Music is more emotionally accessible should\'ve started listening to it earlier, but I wanted the flavor of the stuff on its own.    2:45  Decided that I don\'t like the congestion or laboured breathing/sighing, so will have some nasal decongesting, peripheral stimulating over-the-counter menthol and lev-metamfetamine in a tube. I insufflate it, as well as 50mg caffeine. Congestion and fatigue and brain fog almost immediately subside. Experience improves significantly. Still, the character feels more yin/cold/poisoning-like. Not solar, like mescaline. Not like a vacation, more like a trial to plough through. Creeping subtle muscle soreness.     2:55  Spent time from then til now in dreamy state watching music. Closed eye visuals gradually develop more storyline. Very dreamy. pleasant somatic effects. Enjoy sucking on my cough drop, laying in my sunbeam. Shulgin ++ . No way I could read. Dreamy sedation makes it hard to write. Rather keep laying on the couch. Comes in waves. [later edit: +++  only for waves of sedation/noddiness; I couldn\'t have functioned in the times where the waves hit me.] On the downswing?  Very nice and warm. Seems like other people would enjoy this with pot. It\'s like a mellow LSD. Feels mentally healthy. Similar toxic feeling in stomach and bowels as with LSD. Mentally cloudier than mescaline. I\'m beginning to wonder if the butane wash was actually important, as this is incomparably better than straight seeds in terms of side effects. Character otherwise quite similar. No more noticeable respiratory depression.    3:14  Genuine open eyed hallucination. I saw the silhouette of light cast by the sun through the window move across the wall of my room, as if it was night and a car was driving by. Obviously, that\'s not possible at midday. Were it not for that, I would have believed it was real. In the absence of much else by way of open eye visuals, this was really strange. I have never once had a hallucination on any 5-HT2A target psychedelic. Truly weird. Pupils normal.    3:22  Mild chills and agitation. Oh yeah, that\'s because it\'s legitimately cold in the house and I just got up to pee.   3:45  Effects aren\'t actually in decline. It just comes in waves like mushrooms. I really might\'ve missed much of the experience if not for music.  3:50  Woke up from my music induced trance. Open eye visuals seem to be mildly present. Hands and face look strange and over-detailed. Occasional subtle flares of light in the periphery of my field of vision. So it took a long time getting here, but the effects now are extremely similar to low-dose LSD. Arguably indistinguishable, given the variety of effects that LSD can produce from experience to experience.  4:11  Going strong. Eating madelines biscuits and rooibos tea now, about all I can convince myself to swallow quite a strange experience, eating while tripping. It\'s quite hard to stay on task (wash dishes/cook/etc.)  I have struggled to keep my eyes open this whole experience. The internal dream state has been compelling in the literal sense of the word. If open eye visuals were present, I wouldn\'t even have noticed them, off in my waking dream like I\'ve been.  Unknown  Struggling with typing formatting. Kind of tired of the smell of cinnamon at this point. I\'m going to have some more caffeine to offset inward drifting eye closing.    20 min later  Caffeine was a good choice. So was choosing to watch Book of Kells  5:00  Effects greatly diminished; not sober, but close-ish.   5:30  Same as above. Thinking that the feeling is probably caffeine induced. Still, much more functional. Could not have passed or maintained well earlier. Feel like I might be able to now. Back to ++. Might actually try playing some video games. Time dilation pretty on par with LSD.  6:15  Yawning. So much yawning. I\'m not coming up on mushrooms what is this? Took more caffeine. Effects mostly subsided and congestion has returned (probably allergies). Kind of like the tail of acid, but instead of obnoxious residual stimulation, it\'s obnoxious residual sedation. Still some jaw clenching. Wonder if I could sleep? Way too early to test.  6:50  Close enough to baseline that I can read technical articles. So gassy.  745  Mood vaguely unpleasant and dysphoric, and has been for some time. That\'s what I get for playing zombie games before totally reaching baseline, I suppose. Guts feel dried up, stretched tight, and gassy. Typical to an LSD comedown for me, albeit milder.    9:30  Went to bed. Fell asleep easily by 10pm.  1:00am   Woke to drunk neighbors returning. Took some time to fall back asleep due to highly uncharacteristic anxiety. Wanted to get up to check to see if the door was locked, but was sure that I wouldn\'t be able to fall asleep again if I did. Noticed that I was dehydrated and drank some water.  Next day  I felt adequately rested, but a little emotionally drained as if I had had a poor night\'s sleep. some afterglow. Struggled a little with familiar concepts at work (\'wow! Subway sandwiches are really NARROW!\') High dose caffeine did not shake the feeling of emotional drain/dysphoria, it just made me more active.  Rest of the week, my mood was higher than usual.    Results:  Throughout the course of the experience, it felt as if different active compounds were present and overlapping to different degrees as they were absorbed and metabolized at different rates throughout. Take that for what it\'s worth--a single substance can just as easily go through definite stages. Still, the profound \'noddiness\' of the early experience overlapped into the clean, healthy headspace of the second part of the trip unevenly. Late parts of the trip had the dysphoric elements of a chewed HBWR experience that I disliked even more than the gut cramps, vasoconstriction, and nausea. That, coupled with the tail of the experience feeling a little like the gritty come-down off of LSD makes me loathe to repeat it. I\'m just not a fan of LSD. If the positive mental headspace prevailed throughout, I might\'ve revisited it. I really wanted to test the same dosage sans cassia oil, but considering this, I probably won\'t. Given its similarities to LSD, I\'ll venture that a lot of people would actually quite like this. Hopefully they\'ll do the research for me and post their results. Even better, they\'ll actually have analytical equipment and will be able to settle this LSA/LST/LSH/cinnamylidene-bislysergamide question once and for all.     Conclusion:  It\'s possible that some of the complex spectrum of effect were due to the (possibly irrelevant and either way not totally effective) butane blast step. This is further complicated, as the initially clear final product was darkened to light brown by successive washes, likely reintroducing compounds the wash was intended to eliminate in the interest of maximizing extraction efficiency. These compounds may have coloured the experience similarly to the chewed HBWR experiences that I so disliked before. Since I initially presumed that the step was pointless, I would have skipped it, if not for how negative my previous experiences with HBWR were. One more like those would prevent me from ever testing it again, so I wanted to do this one by the book.     I felt similarly about the idea of adding a source of cinnamaldehyde. Several organic chemists pointed out reasons why adduct formation with cinnamaldehyde was impossible under those conditions. Still, several organic chemists also pointed out the bk-2c-B was too unstable due to dimerisation only to be proven wrong, and we all know mescaline technically can\'t cross the blood-brain barrier... The difference in onset between LSA and LSA+cinnamaldehyde seemed self-testable, and I already had a bottle of cassia essential oil at home already, so I decided what the hell. The strange chronology of the effects seems to have spoiled my hopes for that.     My experience came on quickly, which is unlike most LSA experiences, but the peak was uneven. I thought the peak had been reached at +1:00, but the character changed sharply to heavy noddiness at +1:30, before returning to waking consciousness at +2:15. There was a short period of health, clarity, and insight, but the trip was mostly characterized by dreaminess and fog. The noddiness and sedation are characteristic of LSA, but warm extremities are not. My two prior experiences were 3 seeds, and both times I exhibited pupil dilation; this time, there was none. My two prior experiences were 3 seeds, and both times I exhibited pupil dilation; this time, there was none. The short duration was also atypical--just under 5 hours from dosing to under level +. This is in keeping with other reports of cinnamon oil adduct formation and is not consistent with HBWR reports at presumed similar dosage levels The strong urge to sleep at the end, however, was not consistent with cinnamon oil reports. My kingdom for analytical instruments! Hell, even a blacklight and some filter paper might shed some light on this question.     It\'s possible that the adduct formation with the cinnamon (if it even is possible) was incomplete, or continued to react over the ~15min it took me to drink it, or (even more unlikely) was affected by the peppermint oil and other oils in the ice cream and cough drop. The reduced efficacy of the butane blast step and the presence of alkaloids not present in other adduct reports may also be a factor.    Finally, it may just be that the seeds I obtained this time were fresher than previous experiences, and that they had a higher or better ratio of LSH?/LST?/whatever to the non-psychedelic depressant LSA than my other batches.     Occam\'s razor suggests that it\'s either a placebo effect in the users that notice a difference, or that it\'s reporting bias (in that the users that do not notice a difference are less inclined to publish a report of their failure.) There are only a few reports online of this preparation method, but the vast majority do mention a significant increase in the speed of onset. Could there be other reasons for this? The irritant action of the cassia oil? Cassia oil inhibiting or promoting enzymatic activity? Some other reaction taking place? This would all be much easier to sort out if I intended to repeat the test with the same amount of extract in two weeks without the addition of the cassia oil, but frankly I just don\'t enjoy ergoloids enough to repeat the experience for the sake of science when there are perfectly good analytical tools out there that I just don\'t have access to."
101824,Beautiful to Terrifying,wandering,"Jun 16, 2020","H.B. Woodrose, Alcohol & Cannabis","I was chilling at a friends house that I didn\'t know too well when I did HBW. We drank a little and smoked some really good bud. He brought out the seeds and said they give you a really mild trip. I had never even heard of them or LSA at all for that matter. I\'ve done LSD about five times and have had good and bad trips, but I felt like I had enough experience with psychedelics that I could handle these, and the fact that he said they won\'t do much made me not worry.     I ate two seeds when I was decently high. I started to feel really good and floaty so I ate either 2 or 3 more while smoking a little more, too. We went to lay down and I\'m pretty sure he felt right asleep. My mind was running like crazy though and there was no way I was sleeping. We were listening to really pretty melodic dubstep and I just closed my eyes and started tripping pretty hard. I kept imaging what the music would look like and saw some beautiful landscapes and designs in my head. I didn\'t open my eyes to see if there were visuals cause everything I was seeing in my mind was so beautiful. It was also pitch dark in the room so I couldn\'t see much anyways. I had all these crazy euphoric thoughts about things like inner peace, and becoming one with yourself. I felt great and like I had finally found the answer on how to be truly happy all the time. Then I have no idea what happened, but everything went to shit.     Out of nowhere I got really anxious and overwhelmed Out of nowhere I got really anxious and overwhelmed and just wanted the music to stop. I went up to go to the bathroom and while I was standing in front of the sink I got SUPER dizzy and light headed. My vision went super blurry and then black. It kind of came back it was really hard to see anything. I felt like I was going to collapse. I also felt very nauseous but couldn\'t bring myself to throw up. I stumbled my way back into the bedroom and laid down. The rest of the night I tried to tell myself over and over again that I was fine. I kept trying to bring back the euphoric thoughts but it didn\'t work. Morning finally came and I wanted to go back to my own house but when I tried to get up and walk I felt the same intense dizziness and fell right back onto the bed.     I laid there until my friend picked me up to drive me home. The whole next day I felt extremely weak and kind of depressed. I\'m not sure if my trip went bad because it was combined with weed and alcohol, or if I didn\'t ingest the seeds properly, but it was truly terrifying. The fact that I was with someone I hadn\'t known too well also made things worse because it was hard to find comfort in him. If I were to try these again I would definitely not mix them with any other substance, and I would try take them in different way as opposed to eating them."
100316,There and Back Again,Nk,"Jun 15, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Background:  I started off with one Dramamine and 8 seeds. Took the pill and then chewed and swallowed the seeds separately. I\'m a generally happy person, most of the trip I was in my own home, it was a sunny day and I was wearing comfortable clothes. I\'ve taken LSD before in large doses and always had a good trip. I took LSA before but I fell asleep and then woke up full-on-tripping and it wasn\'t good, but not bad either. The friend I took it with can be pretty unstable, and has never done drugs outside of weed before. I was pretty concerned for her but she did great.    Setting:  It was a sunny day in LA, so me and my friend (who took 6) decided to wander to a grassy area away from my place and lie down.    Time1 hour - She was vomiting a tiny bit, but she was okay. I was fine. I decided to order Thai food, so I called in the order and we started walking back to my place.    2 hours - I vomited a bit off my balcony. Friend was violently vomiting. We both took an aspirin to help with breathing. I had an IUD inserted into my uterus a couple weeks before and I was very scared it would come out from the vascular constriction.    3 hours later - friend calmed down and we were both laying on couches. She started talking about her feelings. She had a lot of revelations. I was feeling pretty happy but every time a song came on or I closed my eyes I started tripping, and it was uncomfortable. I took another aspirin.    4 hours later - My friend has the brilliant idea of smoking a bowl. I normally do not like marijuana, as it makes me paranoid and and depressed. However this time, it made the whole world extra-colorful. For about a minute the trip was reminicent of LSD. After that, I was falling into songs or my own mind. It was almost exactly like LSD except for the visuals. But time-lapsing, feeling muscles contract extra extra slow, having songs turn into places inside my mind - all of this was happening. At one point, I wondered if all the LSD I took had actually been LSA, but then I realized that I didn\'t have any nausea with LSD.    6 hours later - My friend was coming down and her eyes got back to normal. Mine were still like saucers. The guy I am dating came over to see how I was and he brought candy. I was not tripping but I was still high. I was hearing things everywhere. I was afraid I broke my brain for a little bit. I could make myself hear things that weren\'t there. But the sounds eventually went away.    9 hours later - I also came down from it, probably as I was falling asleep. I don\'t remember any dreams. Before I fell asleep I told the guy I\'m dating that I loved him (for the first time, but I dont think he heard/understood) I felt happy and wonderful.    Next day - Very afterglowy. Everything is beautiful, but not visually. Things existing just seemed to make me happy. My friend said she was a bit depressed after, but realized she\'s had a problem with depression for a long time and decided to seek therapy. She said she would do it again and it was a good experience.     In conclusion: I would do it again. Yes, it\'s different from LSD but at the same level for me. The nausea is unfortunate but once I got past it, it was wonderful. I was surprised at the similarity. Based on the other experiences, I did not expect it to be so similar. <!-- I recommend using the same precautions as you would with LSD, because it can take you to the same places. -->Similar to LSD, I went to several \'dark\' places but I was okay with it and always found a way out. I had no real intentions going in, but I guess I did conquer my fear of saying I love you, and I realized how important it is to say it even if relationships come and go. I felt honest with myself in a way I had not felt in a long time. It\'s almost like I came back to myself. I let the fear go."
106941,Respectful of This Mighty Seed,TheMentor,"Jun 3, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"About a week ago I decided to order some HBRW seeds after having read about them pretty extensively in the past, I\'ve never done psychedelics before but am a very experienced user of most others (opiates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines.. Pretty much every major). This didn\'t prepare me for what I was about to experience.    I\'d read the most effective way to prepare was to extract the main component to prevent the illness that came along with it, but due to not wanting to wait the recommended time it took, decided against it. Bad idea!    With a heavy desire to \'expand my mind\' like so many other great men have before me (I always think of Steve Jobs and his respect toward this) I received an order of 100. This was on a Thursday night. The plan was to wait until Friday/Saturday when I could be alone and not have many responsibilities the next day, but I got done early that night so decided it may be better to do it while someone was here, just in case.    Around 8:45 PM I put 6 in my mouth, having read 8 was around a full dose and wanting to start out conservatively. I chewed them up and sucked on them for about 60 seconds. After about 30 minutes and nothing happening I checked around a little more and remembered it was recommended to leave them in about 30 minutes. So I put 7 more in my mouth for about 30 minutes.    This was right around 9:35 or so...    T: + 1 Hour  Around 10:30 I started feeling a little noxious but couldn\'t throw up. Colors started to become more \'alive\' during this. (This is only visuals I had) as I watched House, M.D. white shirts almost glowed. Other colors popped out much more.    T: + 2.5 Hours    Around 12:00 AM I start feeling heaviness in my chest, sorta hard to breath. Out of nowhere I got a severe pain in my neck and a mild headache. (NEVER get headaches.. Definitely not coincidental) I finally start vomiting. This took a long time from the majority of reports I read, it usually starts in the first hour and the entire trip should only last about 4-8 hours. I was worried because it\'d taken so long. During this process I developed pretty severe anxiety. None of the effects I\'d experienced was I prepared for, so when I started having trouble breathing I was obviously concerned when I started having trouble breathing I was obviously concerned. Maybe I\'d taken too much. Maybe the trace amounts of cyanide (supposedly) contained in the shells I was sensitive to...    As I sat in front of the toilet for the next hour and a half or so, I continue to feel heavy cheated, tired, vomiting continuously. At this point I want to just stop vomiting so I can go to bed. Bad experience so far and I figured, if I did start tripping, it was going to set it up horribly.    T: 4 Hours    Around 1:30 AM I finally stop vomiting. Lost the desire completely almost instantaneously. I look in the mirror and my pupils are dilated. I go lay down and things become blurry. My AC has the temperature in green. Over the next few minutes it becomes blurry. I turned the TV off previously in an attempt to fall asleep. I have a desire to turn it back on to see if any visuals happen. The effects prevent me from getting up at all for the next 2 hours.    Experience:  As I lay in bed, I closed my eyes and my mind is racing. Very vividly, my thoughts are racing from one subject to another. At first, it felt like I was flying. My trip offered no visuals but the feelings were so intense. I remember games I\'ve played, seeming like I was my character in them, movies I\'ve watched. Thoughts about my family. My business, things I want to accomplish. It seemed so real, like I\'d already done everything. I could visualize myself having achieved success in this, having done that.    Around 2:30-3:00 AM I was still under the effects. I made myself get on Facebook to update a friend on the status, vaguely. When I did it seemed to break the trance I was in. I finally turned back on TV and watched House, M.D. like normal. The voices were weird. Sounded alien. Almost not understandable. When I looked away from the screen to focus on something else (phone) the voices sped up.    I finally passed out.    After-effects & conclusion:    The next day I still had a mild neck pain. (Weird?) But a totally renewed outlook on some of the things I took for granted. I was much more patient with people, nicer, a better outlook on life.    During my anxiety I declared I\'d never do this again. Now, as long as proper precautions are taken (CWE!) I think it could be a very pleasant experience. The illness that came along with it definitely could have set me up for a horrible experience / trip<!--  so do not take shortcuts-->."
103914,Extreme Lethargy,God Is Love,"Jun 1, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"It was my second separate experience with HBWS.  First time, took 1 seed just to be sure I didn\'t have any sort of bad reaction.  Everything went fine with barely any noticeable effects or nausea.     My second experience, I decided to start out with 2 seeds.  It was in my apartment.  I was alone for several hours without any distractions and I decided 2 seeds was good to start.  I was on an empty stomach and it was about 11:45 in the morning.  I used a utility razor to scrape the outer coating off of the seeds and popped them in my mouth and chewed them.  Surprisingly, they weren\'t too hard to chew.  The taste was unfavorable but not gag-worthy.  I had planned on taking them and going for a walk in a few hours to a local park.  Here is how things went down:    00:00 - Took seeds.  Chewed thoroughly.      00:30 - Notice a slight change in consciousness, but only barely noticeable differences, not enough to describe how.       00:50 - Notice significant difference in consciousness, but still unsure how to describe.    01:00 - At one hour into it, I start feeling a weird mixture of an antsy feeling along with a drop in energy.  It was as if I was super physically tired (not mentally and not sleepy).  And I just kind of sunk into the couch.  I notice a subtle trippy feeling going on in my head as I space out into things around the room and out the window.    01:15 - I feel as though the \'up\' has stopped and decide to take one more seed.  During and after chewing this seed, I did feel some slight nausea.  It was nothing alarming that I had to run to a bucket for, but just slightly uncomfortable.    01:45 - Nausea is coming and going in waves.  It never gets severe, however I often think about running to the bathroom just in case it does.  It never really progresses to a severe nausea, and eventually goes away.    02:00 - At two hours after ingestion, I am feeling very drowsy and the sleepiness starts to set in.  I can\'t help but close my eyes to the chill music playing in the background.  During my closed eye time, I noticed an exaggeration in my senses.  It feels like a between wake/sleep state, which I get often as I fall asleep, but this was exaggerated.  I felt a whooshing wind sweep over my consciousness like waves in the ocean, over and over again. It was subtle, and I felt neutral to it.  I think I dozed off for a while and I kept slightly waking and falling back to sleep.  After a while of this for maybe half an hour, I noticed that it was getting extremely difficult for me to wake up and get up.  I felt so extremely lethargic that I could barely have the energy to turn over, or move any muscles.  Some might say this is extreme relaxation, but I didn\'t exactly want to feel that way.  I wanted to get up and be alert, but it wasn\'t happening anytime soon.  All the trippy feelings were gone and I was just left with an extreme lethargy.  I kept trying to get up, but kept flopping down like a rag doll.  I eventually mustered everything I had to get up and go to the bathroom and came back to the couch and sat again. About another 20 minutes later, I realized I hadn\'t eaten anything, so I got up to make some food.  While I was walking, my feet dragged and my arms flopped everywhere and my head hung low.  After eating, I started to feel better very slowly. After eating, I started to feel better very slowly.    04:00 Its about 4 hours after ingestion and I\'m still feeling very lethargic. I am awake now and do not feel like doing ANYTHING.  I can make myself get up if I really want to, but its still very difficult to muster the energy.    After all is said and done, I am surprised how the lazy and lethargic feeling set in.  I was not expecting that to be a big part of it, but it just goes to show how everyone can react differently and it\'s always good to start with a very small dose to see how you react.  I might try HBWS again in the future, but I\'m in no rush, and I might try an alcohol extraction next time with a greater amount of seeds to see if it will make any difference.  I didn\'t enjoy this experience overall, but it could have been a lot worse. Some people have horrible trips and extreme nausea, and all I am is stuck on the couch.  I wish in a way I could go back to not taking them, but I\'m glad I did because I learned how I react to it and realized that sometimes unexpected symptoms can happen and throw you a curve ball to whatever you were expecting."
89813,These Are Serious Business,ariqs,"May 29, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first experience with anything like this. I read a lot about it before I did it, but it didn\'t end up being what I expected.  <!-- This stuff is serious business. -->    I ordered up 200 \'Super Strong\' HBWR seeds, and got them a few weeks later. (They seem to have gotten lost in the mail for a while.)  I counted out 7 and ground them up in my coffee grinder.  I opened the grinder to find the seeds had stuck to the sides, and there wasn\'t really anything to dump out, so I used distilled water to rinse the grinder out and poured that into a cup.  I put a clove of garlic in the cup, and used my handheld blender to make a homogeneous mixture of distilled water, garlic and HBWR seeds. (I read the garlic is supposed to help with the cyanogens in the HBWR.)  I plugged my nose and downed the mixture.  A half hour later my left eye started twitching, and my veins looked as if someone wrote on them with a blue marker. <!--  I\'m guessing this relates to the fact that LSA is supposed to constrict your blood vessels, but I\'m not certain. --> Other than that, I just felt a tad different than normal.    A hour and forty-five minutes later I was in an incredibly uncomfortable state of mind.  The best way I can describe it is like having to hold up as much weight as you can possibly manage over your head indefinitely; in this case my arms being my sanity, and the weight a manifestation of those potent little devilish seeds. Gravity itself even seemed twice as strong.  I was being forcefully pushed out of my mind, and it was a painful experience.  My tactile sense was numbed,  but this numbness was not an expression of any sort of comfort - it was the fact I was already in too much internal pain to experience anything else.   My vision was blurry, and I was drooling.    Two and a half hours later I started feeling some relief from the pressure and could explore my insanity. My vision was messed up, but there were no visuals.  I had the sensation of bubbles floating in my mind, and everywhere they went, they scrambled it around.  Sometimes it felt good, sometimes it felt bad, and sometimes it was just plain confusing.  The painful pressure that defined the first part of my experience would flow in and out like waves at the beach.    Three hours later I started to notice that my jaw and teeth were in pain because I was clenching them together with great pressure. I was surprised because I hadn\'t read about it.  I had to consciously keep my mouth partly open, or my jaw muscles would spasm shut.  Most of the higher functioning parts of my mind had shut down, and I was noticing a distinct lack of any level of sentience I was used to;  I felt like a monkey.  I had a strong oral fixation, which I\'ve never had before,  and I found  immense pleasure in petting my cat.  I noticed certain parts of my humanity I put to rest over the years because they were uncomfortable were awakening I noticed certain parts of my humanity I put to rest over the years because they were uncomfortable were awakening, whether I wanted them to or not.  I\'m not sure how my cat could tell, but he was very nervous and looking around for something stalking him.   At some level he was clearly in tune with my internal anxiety - perhaps my dilated eyes meant something to a cat.    The rest of my experience pretty much stayed the same except anxiety and fatigue were slowly building, and I tried to escape it by sleeping but I couldn\'t.  It was over ten hours in before I could get to sleep.  (My dreams were more vivid.)  I woke up and decided to write this because I didn\'t feel everything I read  prepared me for what I experienced. My mind is still not all there so forgive me if this is poorly written, but  I consider myself quite mentally tough, and I could only barely handle this.   Be very careful with these seeds.  They\'re no joke, and they last a long time."
88791,Fantastic Time,Moopie,"May 28, 2020","H.B. Woodrose, Meclizine & Cannabis","While this was my first H.B. Woodrose trip it certainly wasn\'t my first plunge into the ether. I regularly smoke marijuana and occasionally indulge is some sort of opioid or another. But I look for fun trips to take when the mood washes over me and the last couple of weeks I have been wrestling with the mood. After doing much research I decided on HBW because LSA seemed like an appealing chemical to me After doing much research I decided on HBW because LSA seemed like an appealing chemical to me and HBW seemed like the best way to get it. After doing even more research I decided on a method of ingestion that combined the best parts, at least in my mind, of the reports I had read. It mostly relies on sublingual absorption but I do ingest some of the seed matter.    I started by finding what seemed like a reliable source for HBW. I initially picked up some Ghana strain seeds from an online vendor. I saw not for human consumption on the website and in my haste didn\'t read the fine print. Once I realized my mistake I promptly found someone selling the Hawaiian strain online who had an overwhelming amount of positive feedback and ordered from them. After receiving my Hawaiian strain seeds I set to work preparing myself and the seeds.    First I ground the seeds in a coffee grinder to get them as fine as possible. Finer the grind the more surface area of the seed is exposed. I DID NOT remove the outer furry layer from the seeds. In my  research, anytime I came across something remotely scientific it spoke of the cyanide in the outer husk as nothing more than a popular urban myth. I\'m sure nothing would be lost, besides some time. (Note: When grinding the seeds I used pulse power. LSA is very temperature sensitive and spinning blades and motors can lead to serious heat if left on for too long.)    After grinding the seeds I mixed the powder with half a teaspoon of distilled water. <!-- I do not recommend tap water if it can be helped. The amount of impurities can be ludicrous and something as simple as excessive chlorine levels could do enough damage to the LSA to ruin the whole trip.--> At this point I let the mixture sit for about ten minutes as I prepared myself.     I brushed my teeth and my gums. The ideas here are to make sure there are no foreign objects or dead cells in way of absorption as well as increasing blood flow to the area to aid in uptake speed. I then swished a mixture of vodka and mint mouth wash (50/50 mix) around my mouth for several minutes. This burned like hell, but the idea here is to weaken the cell walls of the gums to increase uptake further.     By this point my mouth felt exceptionally clean and the seed powder had absorbed the water turning it into a sort of a paste. I then spread the paste along my lower gum line and my upper gum line the best I could. It then became a waiting game. After ten minutes the saliva had turned the paste into a seed stew in my mouth and I began swishing the mixture back and fourth, allowing the mixture to touch as much gum surface are as possible.    After 25 minutes it was time to spit out the mess in my mouth. But knowing that human saliva is vastly underrated as something that breaks things down I feel like spitting out what is essentially a warm, and potentially powerful, extraction down the drain. At this point I moved as much of the grit as possible to the front of my mouth and sucked all the juices out of it and swallowed them. I then spit out what looked like the majority of the actual plant matter and a small amount of brown saliva.    6:20 PM: Finished dosing less then five minutes ago but already felt a warm sensation rush over my body.    6:45 PM: Started feeling what can only be described as drunk. Decided to play some Street Fighter.    7:00PM: Feeling completely trashed and barely able to tell what I am doing with the arcade stick. Finally feeling hungry after fasting all day in preparation for the trip. Asked the wifey to make me some pasta. I took a hit of marijuana.     7:20PM: Somewhere in between asking for pasta and it being made for me I found myself entering into the ether. I had lost interest in Street Fighter and wandered to the couch to relax a bit. By the time the bowl of pasta made it to me I was less interested in the food and more interested in how good the warm bowl felt in my hands.     7:25PM: After I spent five minutes staring at my food and feeling the bowl the wifey asked if it was good. It then occurred to me I had not yet tasted it. I took a single piece of pasta and put it in my mouth. It was good and, more important to me at that time, it felt good in my mouth. I rolled the piece of pasta around in my mouth for several minutes before swallowing. After proclaiming it was good I set the bowl down with the intention of eating it. But I shortly entered into an amazing internal struggle. The LSA had crept up on me and it started to feel completely normal to be torn between eating the food and not. I laid on the couch and fought with myself for a long time. I would sit up and grab the bowl and set it back down promptly then throw myself back on the couch to continue my internal debate.    8:00 PM: The wifey spoke to me again and it was enough to let my grasp reality long enough to know I wasn\'t going to eat the food anymore. I had her put it away for later and manage to make my way over the computer. I opened up MS Paint and had a grand time drawing whatever my heart wanted while listenign to music. The music felt excellent and unexpectedly the drawing was less about making fun stuff, as it was when I colored when on shrooms or drew on cactus, and it was more about how amazing each individual mouse stroke looked and felt. I took a hit of marijuana.    8:20 PM: From here until 9pm I don\'t really remember what happened, I lost myself in the ether, but I do know there was a period during which I could not stop dancing regardless of what else I was doing.    9:00 PM: My favorite TV show came on for a two hour special. I was instantly engrossed. For the first hour it felt as though I was in the show with the characters. I was emotionally invested in every action they took and found myself asking the wifey things like, What are we going to do next? when the show went to commercial. Oddly enough when the second hour of the show started I lost the feeling of being part of the story and felt as though I was the director. I could clearly hear calls for action and cut. I found myself critiquing the acting of each person on screen as though they could hear me and would care.    11:00 PM: At this point I\'ve come mostly back to earth. Things make sense again and  I no longer was exhibiting the signs of tripping. But the tail end of the affects were still easy to feel. Things were much more pleasant than normal and I felt very at piece. I took a shower and the wifey and I took a trip to the grocery store. Things there were nice too but nothing terribly overwhelming came of it.     After sleeping soundly for nine hours I exhibited an extremely pleasant mood that seemed unshakable until almost twenty-four hours from the dosing.     Notes:     1.About halfway through the trip I had a bit of nausea. I\'m not sure if it was a function of not eating all day, the HBW or a little of both. Regardless a single less drowsy Dramamine later it went away. <!-- I highly recommend taking one before the start of your HBW experience.-->  2.Marijuana did seem to intensify the trip the times I smoked it. But I was so far gone I couldn\'t tell you if it was the marijuana effecting the trip or if I just smoked at convenient intervals that allowed it to seem that way. On my next trip I intend to take a smaller dose and see if the Marijuana actually increases the experience.   3.I took, what seems to be, a rather large first dose. I know it may not seem like it from the way I write it<!--  but unless you are like me and -->. I enjoy the feeling of being lost in the trip I enjoy the feeling of being lost in the trip, having little to no control over where it goes, there were several times during the trip where someone not prepared could have panicked. <!-- What I\'m trying to say is take a smaller dose than my silly self if you\'re not sure on how you\'re going to feel about it.-->  4.I didn\'t have any CEVs of OEVs but the fact of the matter is I was so engrossed in the things I did I forgot to even look for any CEVs and the room was bright and vibrant I would have been amazed to find OEVs.     All in all it was a great trip that I plan on revisiting in the near future."
108157,The Woods Experiencing Themselves,Kuntuzangpo,"May 27, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"30 yr old male, 250 lbs, much experience with psychedelics including many tryptamine and phenethylamine chemicals. Have been sworn off from all chemical medicines for almost two years now, and a semi-regular small amount cannabis user ( I go through an 8th in like 2 months with my vaporizer).    I have a couple years experience with meditation and am trying to be a somewhat serious Dzogchen practitioner, along with my shamanic wanderings in the realms of sacred plant medicine. I am a big fan of ayahuasca in low to medium doses, and my one proper experience with San Pedro powder was amazing as well, so I am excited to add another ally to my toolbox.     I have eaten some form of HBWR before, when I lived in Hawaii. I harvested them myself but now having received these Madagascar seeds I am curious what I ate in Hawaii. I would eat 10 of these (VERY large) seeds after scraping the fuzzy coating off, no bad taste just a mild nuttiness, and no real trip to speak of, just a sedated dreaminess even when mixed with weak mushroom tea kombucha (mushroom tea put in a jar with honey and a kombucha culture, fizzy and very nice medicine).    11:45 am  3 seeds Madagascar strain Hawaiian Baby Woodrose chewed and swallowed, with a couple vaporizer puffs of mid-grade cannabis and a glass of water with Lemon Essential Oil    12:30 p.m.  Trip is definitely kicking in hard now, going to vomit, a tiny bit of seed material comes out, stomach feels much better after an easy vomit    1:00 p.m.    Me and my pregnant partner/lovely sober sitter finish watching The Tale of Princess Kaguya, and the end scene with moon royalty coming to the earth on clouds signals the arriving of my experience in full. At this point I have a strong body buzz, mild rainbow flickering visuals, and some very mild nausea/heaviness    At this point I somewhat lose track of time and from now until around 3:30 I am having a too intense experience. I start to chant a purification mantra of my lineage, and it only makes things worse (haha). I am getting very paranoid and worried about silly things, and my partner wakes up from a short nap to attempt to calm me down.     I am getting very strong OEV at this point, rainbow columns all over my white walls and tracers on the ladybugs as they crawl across the ceiling. The body high is starting to feel oppressive, I am trapped in my body and not too happy about it. I do have moments of clarity where I calm myself down for a second, but they are few and far between at this point.  My partner leaves to go get some food from our kitchen (in another building on the other side of the property) and leaves me in our bedroom.     The bad trip finally breaks when I muster up the courage to go outside. It only takes a few minutes for my experience to shift from overwhelmingly negative, to one of the best trips of my life. I am walking in the woods for a second, and then turn around to go find my partner and tell her I am doing better. (the last time she saw me I was freaking out and not having a good time). I have a large quartz crystal I am squeezing in my hand, and my Thai bamboo flute. These both become talismans for the rest of my experience.    At this point I am experiencing overwhelming happiness, a groovy body high, some mild leg cramps and vasoconstriction symptoms. The visual effect is just a strong richness in all of the nature I am seeing, an HD clarity and beauty to all of my surroundings that I am constantly impressed with.  I keep remarking to my partner this is the best trip ever! I am so happy I came out of the negative state!    We go for a short walk in the woods, it is super hot and I get very sweaty so I remove my shirt. I am talking out loud to the woods, asking for teachings on how to live in harmony with the elements, and also swinging my flute and using it as a kind of energetic dagger to cut through illusion. I go into a gibberish state regularly, where I am speaking something very Japanese-esque and acting like I know some tai chi movements or something (haha!). We arrive down at the bottom of the hill, I am praying out loud to the water and asking it to teach me how to honor it, and not to waste it, and how to heal all the waters of the earth. I chant aloud the name of the Water Element Goddess in my lineage, and this is a fantastic experience! It is probably around T+5 at this time.    We turn around to walk back up the hill towards our dwelling place, at this point I feel some annoying vasoconstriction in my legs that makes walking uphill very tiring. I tell myself next time I journey with this medicine I will have a strong cacao drink with lemon essential oil and ginger root on hand, to combat any nausea and vasoconstriction. I might even bring my cannabis vaporizer with, although I definitely did not need it to intensify this trip!!    I am thanking the plants, proclaiming out loud that they are the teachers of the whole world, I even hug and kiss a tree.    Midway through our walk, I am talking to my partner about the fusion of my Dzogchen meditation practice and these plant medicine journeys, when I realize I have not even tried to meditate at all since it wasnt working too well when I was losing my shit\x85.    So I drop into the Dzogchen space for a second\x85 And there is one quick passing moment when I cease to exist, and I am the woods experiencing themselves.    This passes and I am back in my body, and stoked stoked stoked that I had that experience! These particular seeds are very very powerful medicine and one of my new favorites.    We finish our walk back up the hill slowly and pantingly, me being vasoconstricted and my partner being 3 months pregnant. We arrive at the top of the hill and go inside to cool off for a second, and then we decide its vegan pizza time! We go cook our pizza and eat it. I am still scattered to the 4 winds at this point, around T+6, but definitely the psychedelic effects are ceasing and I am entering the post-experience phase    As of this writing (the next afternoon) I am still a bit sore and crampy, and feel that I certainly need some time in between experiences to let the vasoconstricting alkaloids leave my body.    Overall I adore adore adore this medicine, and while the physical side effects are a bit annoying, with proper supplementation with anti nausea and vasodilating plants, I think I will enjoy this even more. It is trippy as they come, extremely visual even at this lower dose without cannabis, and the connection with nature is second to none. This is  not a medicine for me to take inside, and I will only take it with mucho outside time from now on.    <!-- May your path be Blessed and you journeys be fruitful"
83159,Not Fun,dontlikehbw,"Apr 28, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I was home from college for Christmas break. I had had some HBW seeds for a few months, probably too long of a time, but I decided to try them anyway. I figured that since I was home and not stressed out from school, that this would be a good atmosphere to try the seeds. Unfortunately, none of my friends had the desire to trip out that I had, so I went at it alone.    I scraped off the fuzz from 5 seeds using a metal file. At about 11 pm, I put the seeds in my mouth, chewed them, and held onto them for about 20 minutes before spitting them out. I had read that the LSA could be absorbed into the body this way, and that by not swallowing the seeds, I would not get sick. However, this process made me salivate, so I did end up swallowing some of the seeds with my spit. I made a glass of peppermint tea to prevent nausea. I cant stand the taste of ginger, so I neglected the ginger tea, as I thought this would cause more harm than good.    I did not feel the effects of the LSA instantly, like some people have mentioned. I contemplated trying a few more seeds, but then decided against it, in case it acted soon. At around 12:30, I started to experience a feeling of calmness and unreasonable happiness, and I was starving. I started to experience a feeling of calmness and unreasonable happiness, and I was starving. I ate an orange and almost an entire sleeve of saltines. I was watching That 70s show on my laptop when my eyes started to burn from the light. I noticed that my pupils had dilated so much I could only see a tiny portion of my irises. I was also becoming very tired, and went to lie in my bed. So far, I had not experienced any visuals. The closest to a visual was the tendency for everything in the room to vibrate, and for the lights to seem way more bright. It was about 1 am when my heart began to race and I felt kind of sick to my stomach. Drinking the rest of the tea did not help. I walked around a bit, and opened my window for some fresh air. None of this helped either, so at 1:30, I reached my finger down my throat and made myself throw up into my garbage can. I was too afraid to go to the bathroom, as I knew that my parents may hear, and walk upstairs to check on me. Did I want them to see me, throwing up in the middle of the night, with hugely dilated eyes? No way, they would totally suspect something. Unfortunately my garbage can is wire mesh, and the bag slipped down. Vomit went on my floor and on my sweatpants. Disgusting. I did feel much better though, and was able to clean it up before feeling very strange.    By the time 1:45-2 came, I felt extremely light. I could get up and move, feeling like I was floating. At the same time though, I felt very panicky. I think this was due to the fact that I just could not catch my breath, and my heart was racing. I was feeling pretty shitty by this time, but didnt throw up again. I just went to bed.     I could not fall asleep. I was taking huge, deep breaths, and could not stop. There was nothing I could do to fill my lungs with enough oxygen. My body was also tingling, especially my arms, hands, and feet. Weird thoughts about ugly creatures with strange eyes all over their bodies, flying through color, kept on flashing through my mind. I would open my eyes, and everything would look like normal, except brighter. Led Zeppelins Celebration Day was playing in my head, but way too loudly. It was like I could hear it in real life, as if my head was right next to the stereo, and it was playing at a painfully loud decibel. I spent the next couple of hours gasping for breath, tossing and turning all throughout. I knew that HBW was a vasoconstrictor, so I continued moving my hands and feet to promote blood flow. Then, very suddenly, my breathing slowed and shallowed, and my heart rate returned to normal. I laid there for a bit, making sure I didnt get any more waves of this. After a few minutes, I got up to see what time it was. It was only 4 am, but those two hours had seemed like years. I was so happy when it lifted, and I remember thanking God that I was still alive.     I dont know if I will try HBW again. If I do, I will attempt the tea method, so that I dont swallow any of the seeds. But if I have a bad experience again, that will be the end of the seeds. <!-- People say that the seeds are a milder form of LSD, but it seems like they are way less predictable in how they react with the body.-->"
113495,Overheating Unpleasant,Proka,"Apr 17, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"My first time trying HBW was pretty interesting experience, it was yesterday and I decided to write a trip report to give something back  and also to remember. Overall it was good but it also had one dark moment. I have done 20+ hours of research reading various trip reports before jumping into my own.     Little bit my background: 29 yo, live in mid-EU, experience with a lot of weed, 20x or so DMT, 9x MDMA, 2x mushroom trips and 1x salvia (which I didnt like). Prior to this night, I had taken no drugs for 3 months. My mindset was quite good, expecting a good night.    I purchased the seeds from some Netherlands e-commerce. I am renting an office in town and work as a developer there alone so before I went home, I prepared 5 seeds (cleaned up) and invited a friend to come over. He was going on vacation with another friends next day early in the morning. I briefly told him about the effects of the seeds and if he wants to try them with me. We are childhood friends and kinda trip buddies, we did MDMA together few times already. Anyway, I went home to spend some time with my family and then notified my wife that I am going to the pub, which I usually use as an excuse to stay in the office overnight and trip on whatever substances. She is always really pissed when I go to the pub and yesterday, she even told me if I go, I should also bring a papers with me. Not the first time she is saying that, so I didnt make much of it.     I jumped in the car and drove to a supermarket to get us both a lot of food, which will play a role in another part of the story. Then I picked up my friend and went to the office.    T: 00:00 We each drank 5 seeds smashed and soaked in distilled water for around 3 hours. It was 9:30pm. We did not drink the seeds, just the water. We did not drink the seeds, just the water. We went out to chill a little bit, it was pretty warm - around 23-25 degrees C. We went to a nearby park where we sat and waited. I took 3 extra seeds for each of us in case nothing will be happening. I am always prepared and carrying more drugs with me :)    T:02:00 Still nothing, I am getting disappointed at this point, so we decided to chew 3 extra seeds and swallow after having them for about 15 minutes in the mouth.    T:03:00 We are sitting at our towns train station and starting to get little bit dizzy and tired. We decided to walk back to the office. My friend had a leg cramp and I was feeling slightly drunkish. When we arrived to our office, effects started to kicking in even more. I was super relaxed, I had almost no nausea, but I also couldnt move. I tried to stand up, but my stomach was feeling really weird so I couldnt. My friend managed to get himself to a table where we had some weed and vaporiser. He was on the chair just pushing himself with the legs across the room.    T:04:00 We smoked little bit of weeds. We both had around 3 hits from the vaporiser and it hit us really hard. To get to this state while sober, I need at least 2-3 refills (or 10-13 big hits). It was feeling really good, then I decided to play him a youtube video Timelapse of the Universe, which totally astonished me recently. I hope he didnt mind watching it<!--  as I know he is not much in the universe stuff rather than a girl stuff-->. We at least had a plan what to do and the trip continued.    T:04:30 After watching the video, I really needed to pee. I actually needed to pee for most of my trip. I stood up and realised the whole world is twisting like a wave. It was a similar mushroom or a drunk state, but not exactly. I really dont like drunk state, I dont drink at all, but this was not that bad.    I also realised I am really hungry, my last meal was 9 hours ago. I took some of the food I bought us and laid into the bed. I tried to eat but everything was really hard to swallow. I only managed to pour some milk into my throat which helped me for some time.    I started to get some COVs and also some mild EOVs. It was really nice, although I wish it would be more vivid / extreme.    My hearth rate was 100 when laying down, so +30-40 above the normal value.    At this point of peaking, I almost could not speak! It just was possible, but it was super hard. It was fun at the same time.    T:05:00 After some while I started to feel better, a really slow comedown has started. I managed to eat a banana. As I was feeling I can eat already, I also ate croissant, some chocolate and few other things.    I lied down and tried to listen to some music, but it was not really that amusing. My friend also didnt have much of a joy in playing his own music.    So we just laid on a couch, enjoying the feelings - at least I did.    T:06:00 We decided to get some rest because my friend was going on vacation in a few hours. We spread the couch and tried to get some sleep. This is when the interesting part starts. I  started to feel hot, reeeeally hot. It was coming up for 30 minutes and during that, I first took off my jacket, then my pants, then the t-shirt, socks and when there was nothing on me except my underwear, I started to sweat like shit and run to the bathroom basically naked. Imagine, we are in a big office building where there is a shared bathroom on the floor and the walls to the outside are glass. So I was running to the bathroom, naked, while exposed to the street. Luckily, there is no security camera on the floor and it was late night. Anyway, I threw up all the food I ate an hour ago and covered in sweat I was lying next to the toilet on a cold floor which was actually helping. After few minutes I started to feel much better. I took a t-shirt and cleaned the toilet and its surroundings. Drank some water to help my body function and went to sleep.     T:09:00 In the morning (6am), my friends friends were calling him on the phone telling him that they are in front of his house waiting for him to come down and hit the road for the vacation. Well, he was lying next to me, a few miles away, had slept for just few hours after tripping on HBW. He is actually the kind of person who you would expect this from.     I then slept for another 3-4 hours. I had no hangover or unpleasant feelings apart from slight headache, which passed by the evening.    Summary:  - It was interesting how both of us had different intoxication symptoms, all of them however described in various reports. I couldnt speak, move or eat, and had cold-like symptoms, he had a leg cramp and was better in eating, speaking and moving. Perhaps I think I was more intoxicated - he had two beers during the waiting, so that might have had an effect on this. Plus his last meal was 1.5 hour before the trip, mine 3.  -  I think that the first 5 soaked seeds worked, but I am not sure. The effects might be just out of the 3 seeds we ate.  - A little bit of weed during the come up is really good!  - I think my body started to metabolizing the food so quickly and was unable to use the energy. Maybe that is why I had these feelings of sweating and overheat. I hope if I avoid eating too much food next time, it will be better. I will eat something during the come up to have an energy.  - Feeling really nice and tripping was for around 2.5 hours period.    I really liked the seeds, I will definitely try some more in the future."
94708,The Ganzfeld Effect,TheDiceman,"Apr 2, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"HBW and the Ganzfeld Effect    I am a 22 year old student with experience using various psychedelic\'s over the past few years. This was my second experience with HBW seeds upping my dose from 10 to 12 seeds. This time however, I planned on experimenting with the Ganzfeld effect while on my journey. <!-- To those who are not aware of this I suggest researching ganzfeld, but as-->As a brief summary, it involved cutting off all sensory stimuli using a ping pong ball cut in half taped over the eyes and a form of static played into the ears on repeat,<!-- . Finally a light must be--> with a light on in the room. <!-- For more info: Do a search and you will not be disappointed.-->    I decided to crush the 12 seeds and mix with a tablespoon of honey and simply eat (following a four hour fast) washed down with a cup of ginger/peppermint tea which I have found eases the nausea. Also to note is that I drank ginger tea throughout to help deal with the stomach cramps I have experienced in the past with these seeds.     Within two hours I started to feel the nausea setting in but nothing too bad. This continued for the next hour as the effects started to set in slightly hazy and introspective. It was at this point I went to my room and prepared myself for the ganzfeld experience. I taped the goggles on and laid back, after a few short moments my mind free from all external reality exploded in to what I can only describe as an open sandbox of creativity. My mind raced from vision to vision powerfully as I watched as a fascinated spectator of where my imagination would take me, the whole time melting into the bed feeling like a tiny insignificant organism. After around 20-30 minutes I realised I could control my imagination and started testing this with requesting and creating whatever I wanted to see, similar to a lucid dream. I for the next two hours lived hundreds of different stories and situations that I created, finishing with some deep reflection that left me feeling overwhelmingly positive.    I now removed the ganzfeld glasses and was greeted by a hazy environment and found it difficult to separate what I had just experienced to what I now saw before me. Extremely surreal.  At this point I decided to unwind and float aimlessly enjoying the afterglow which was warm and positive leading to a deep and restful sleep.     <!-- I thoroughly recommend experimenting with HBW seeds and the ganzfeld effect, it truly allows your-->It truly allowed my imagination to run wild in  a beautifully positive experience. <!--  for those experienced in psychedelics.  -->"
102522,Walking Dead Syndrome,Dread Pirate Mo,"Feb 16, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Datura,"Walking Dead Syndrome From the Vantage Point [title got cut off]    Im in my mid thirties. Im a little over six feet in height and weigh about 200 pounds. Ive done about all the major known drugs imaginable. During the late nineties, I tripped on LSD quite frequently.    The experience Im about to describe happened in the summer of 2013 and is beyond anything Ive ever experienced before. Ive heard people describe religious experiences on LSD but of the dozens of times Ive tried it Ive never had anything as remotely profound occur to me as did with woodrose seeds.    It was late August and I was reuniting with a longtime friend. I will refer to this friend as Papa Smurf (for reasons that should become obvious). Papa Smurf introduced me to LSD back in high school; even back then he knew about the legal highs, the exotic plants and the more unusual designer drugs that most people never heard of. He went on to earn an advance degree in psychology but he remained interested in altered states of consciousness.    Papa Smurf was picking me up early in the morning to go hiking in the backcountry of the nearby national forest. I had planned on being a guinea pig and would be trying something called Hawaiian baby wood rose. Being a guinea pig for Papa Smurf wasnt new and usually turned into an interesting experience to say the least.    We got to the trailhead at about nine in the morning. That particular trail began at an old cemetery; thats where Papa Smurf pulled out a miniature zip lock bag filled with what looked to be a few grams of tan powder. Papa Smurf had used a coffee grinder to pulverize the seeds into a powder. I asked How many? Papa Smurf replied, 23 (I had no idea at the time of what constituted a dose). I immediately took the bag, opened it up, unloaded the powdered seed into my mouth and swallowed with the help of a few gulps of water. It wasnt too bad but I did notice a metallic taste in my mouth that lingered.     Over the next half hour Papa Smurf asked several times if I felt anything; if I did it was subtle. Approximately forty-five minutes into the walk something hit me like a freight train. I dont know exactly how to describe it but mostly it was a feeling that something big had happened. By this point in time, I was seeing tracers and everything seemed vibrant and different but the visuals didnt matter as it was as if the essence of my very being had changed in some fundamental way and I couldnt put my finger on it it was as if the essence of my very being had changed in some fundamental way and I couldnt put my finger on it.    About an hour into the hike I noticed that the trees seemed endless and I blurted out loud, there sure are a lot of trees. Papa Smurf replied, Yes there are. I felt so inadequate because thats not what I meant to say. For me the forest had somehow become a fractal or kaleidoscope. It was supernatural somehow but I could not find the language to describe it. From this point on I felt like I had lost my ability to communicate.    I know I must have been sweating and looked horrible. It was so challenging to walk. At some point Papa Smurf took us of trail and down a rocky creek bed. We ended up at a tree that had a protrusion that looked so much like a human head that I felt inclined to treat the tree as if it were a person.  I sat down on the bank there and remember thinking that if I mentally let go I would die. Papa Smurf spent the next few hours stacking stones into immense stacks. While Papa Smurf entertained himself by stacking rocks, I faced an inner dialogue with myself. Somehow I felt death was imminent all I had to do was go. I was scared to let go but for some reason I felt I had to die.    I then began to feel as if I were vibrating. Everything was vibrating and I was part of it. At some point I opened my eyes and Papa Smurf was in my face and looked really scared. I told him I was OK. He said, I know youre ok but I could see he was scared for me. I told him I just got to let go and I closed my eyes and went back to the vibrations that had pleasantly consumed me. Somehow in my own my mind let go meant die which in turn meant to return to a vibrational state. Papa Smurf later told me that I was shaking and trembling as if I were freezing but he didnt want to say anything to me then because he didnt want to scare me.    I could have stayed where we were for hours longer but eventually Papa Smurf wanted to go. My reality at this time was shattered. I had no choice but to follow Papa Smurf. Not only was my mind blown but I was physically exhausted. I felt like a zombie.     At some point we were walking through the forest and Papa Smurf says, Oh my god, look at the Panda over there by the bamboo. At this point Im unable to talk but Im really wondering where were at and how the fuck we got to some place where theres bamboo and panda bears. Papa Smurf always liked to fuck with you in little ways but this time I truly couldnt be sure of reality.     As we walked I began to realize that I had died on that creek bed back there. Nothing seemed strange anymore. I kept repeating out loud Im here, youre here and thats just how it is. Papa Smurf said I kept repeating that phrase. I couldnt carry on a conversation but what I was really thinking was that I had died many times before and every time it was with Papa Smurf. It had just happened again and thats just how it was. I felt like I was in some kind of purgatory where life kept repeating itself up to that same moment.     Every once in a while Papa Smurf would fuck with me. At one point he said with a straight face I cant believe weve been out here in the jungle for fourteen days already. I couldnt say anything back to him but I certainly had an inner dialogue in my head. I thought have we really been out here for fourteen days? I even wondered what country we were in. But then another part of me said, thats just Papa Smurf fucking with me. But even with that thought I couldnt be sure. But these kinds of episodes were familiar too. I had experienced them many times already. At least thats how I felt. It didnt matter if it was jungle or not because it was all purgatory.    There was another instance where Papa Smurf yelled back to me, Hey, whatever you do just dont pick up a rock and hit me in the back of the head with it. I thought, why the fuck would he say that? Is that what Im supposed to do? I seriously had this mental dialogue in my head where I contemplated killing Papa Smurf because I somehow felt I was supposed to do that because he told me not to do it. Those words took on a strange significance.    Eventually we made it out of the forest and to Papa Smurfs car. As we drove I contemplated the seeming fact that I was already dead and nothing really mattered because it had already happened and just kept repeating.  I contemplated the seeming fact that I was already dead and nothing really mattered because it had already happened and just kept repeating. I became obsessed with this idea.    At one point Papa Smurf made an unexpected stop at an apartment complex. He knew the maintenance manager and wanted to say high. He visited with his friend who was painting an apartment unit. I was unable to communicate so I decided Id go outside and look around. While sitting on the second story stairs of the apartments we were at, a car pulled up. I was so convinced that I was reliving life in purgatory that I strongly considered yelling out some expletives simply for the fact that it wouldnt matter because it had already happened somehow. Everything I did or thought about doing was a repetition of something in purgatory that I had already done and therefor my actions really didnt matter. Fortunately I didnt test my theory.    Papa Smurf drove me back to my apartment (now about 4:00 PM). I spent the next few hours contemplating everything that had happened. I began to regain my sanity. Throughout the first half of my trip I had accepted my experience as reality and the fact that I had done drugs weighed little on my interpretation of that reality. During my latter solitude I began to realize that the substance had induced the experience. I knew I was not dead but somehow felt as though I had died and been put back together. The rest of my experience occurred in solitude. I continued to see tracers, bursts of color, and perceptual distortions but they didnt matter. I spent the rest of my experience reflecting on what seemed the most profound experience I had ever had.    I spoke with Papa Smurf late the next day. He confessed that he had added datura seeds to the mix. I spoke with Papa Smurf late the next day. He confessed that he had added datura seeds to the mix. He said he added the seeds so there was more volume in the coffee grinder. He didnt think there was enough for them affect the experience. His guess was that he added about 70-100 datura seeds. Ive since experienced both datura and woodrose by themselves. I think the combination somehow made the experience seem more real.     In reflection, I cant help but think that such an experience could go horribly wrong. I seriously contemplated murder, jumping off a cliff, and calling someone a racial slur because of the weird mental space I was in. I feel like I could have done any of those things. On LSD there is always that part of you that knows that what youre experiencing is the result of the drug. I didnt have that with this experience. It was real. On the other hand, it was truly the most profound experience Ive ever hand. I mean I was dead in purgatory and intimately aware that I was simply replaying my life for the billionth time. Its a bizarre state of mind to believe this. Though the thought of repeating it scares me there is a part of me that wants to do it again."
105560,Altered States Downunder,Mikey,"Feb 2, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Take a Trip to the local rainbow, colour your mind and travel in time !    After not doing any substances for many years, I read about HBWR seeds on the net and found out about the chemical known as LSA - a so called semi - legal high that affects you much like LSD. I just had to try out this amazing molecule to see for myself !     I have done shrooms and a litle bit of acid 15 years ago, but after giving up weed just last year ( I found it was getting way too addictive for me ) and was very keen to try out the so called Seeds of the Gods. Something new was called for tonight !    So I am from Australia ( G\'day Mate ! ) and Baby Woodrose grows wild in Queensland and the seeds are readily available on the net.  As to the exact sub - strain I am not quite sure, but the fresh ones I got really did the trick !  For just $10 - I received a baggie of 30 seeds in the mail, easy enough for at least 3 trips. Excited !    Preparation:   Soaked seeds in warm water for 5 mins and then used a nail file to remove fuzzy husk from the seeds, mixed with lime juice, stirred a lot and let stand for a short while. Mixed with orange  juice and skulled. The seeds have no taste. I made sure to grind up the seeds before I put them in the lime with a mortar to release the alkloids from the seeds. I chose 7 seeds for my first go.  This is a moderate dose , about the equal of maybe 2 - 3 mushies.    So what happened ?    After about 45 minutes I feel a slight effect from the seeds , my mood starts to go up dramatically and I feel a bit tingly.     I sat inside and waited in my city apartment - then after 2 hours the trip really starts - my pupils dilate and the rooms starts to swim a bit. If I smoked weed it would really bring the trip on,  but I just had the seeds themselves to really see if they would work. The trip hits I in waves/stages  - I felt a sense of bliss and great contentment , some people will remark that it is a bit like MDMA and yes - it is-  but with much less intense euphoria.     This trip is fairly gentle and thought - provoking (an introspective journey into myself really ) . The effects are Shamenic and quite similiar to magic mushrooms.    The second part of the trip is where the energy picks up a bit and I want to dance and move. I put on some Trance music and it sounded incredible, like just trippy as hell. This peak only lasted about 40 mins and then I start to come back to reality more, everything looks amazing ; like I am looking at it for the very first time ! I can close my eyes and see oil slick visuals and a few faint fuzzy colours in the air.  I felt a bit tired by this stage ( 3 hours in ) so I took a cold shower and laid down to rest - the water feels just so good .    The only bad part of the experience is I get stomach cramps from the seeds and have some Mylanta antacid on standby and I had some ginger tea as well to ease the gut.     Pros :  1. Cheap and readliy available on the net.  2. Nice high with a mild comedown ; quite easy to control my feelings on the trip  3. Lasts only  about 4 hrs overall - so I am not awake all night tripping balls like LSD or DOM.    Cons :  1. Does upset the stomach quite a bit,  I found  2. Weaker trip than other drugs  3. Tolerance is developed quickly-  but I wouldnt want to do HBWR that often, just every now and again.    In summary, 7 crushed up HBWR seeds yielded a good trip and a taste of Shamanism. I saw myself very clearly on the trip and experienced aspects of my \' inner \' self. It is not really a great visual - type journey, but still very enjoyable.     The next day I feel quite tired but not hung over too much. I went for a swim at the beach and had a couple of salad rolls.    One more thing -   I did not eat for at least 6 hours before I tripped as I needed an empty stomach for the seeds to really kick in well and do their stuff. It affected me like an antidepressant and gave me unusual insights into myself as well. It affected me like an antidepressant and gave me unusual insights into myself as well.    A truly unique substance. I did mine at night 6.30 pm to about 11 pm, but I think that if I had them in Nature I would appreciate the effects more rather than just watching movies alone on TV.    To conclude - well, not exactly the Seeds of the Gods, but certainly a magickal experience to remember ! I award a 7 out of 10 of the scale of affects."
113890,Mental Collapse,Nkoulou999,"Jan 21, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first experience with any psychedelic substance. A friend had sold them to me after buying them online and assured me they were safe to ingest and that he had taken precautions to prepare them. I decided to go all out and eat 13 seeds (a VERY bad idea. This is way above the recommended heavy dose, especially for someone my size). I was very curious at the time to have an out of body experience with a substance, and figured this would get me there. I chewed the seeds up at about 8 pm. They have an awful taste, very strong and earthy.    I force the seeds down and wait for the affects to kick in. I\'m home alone and lay in my bed watching netflix. Half an hour in, terrible stomach aches suddenly hit me and I am rendered immobile with pain. It felt like more than a stomach ache, like a knife was in my abdomen and was repeatedly stabbing me. No other affects so far other than this pain.    An hour in, the pain in my stomach starts to fade and I feel better. I watch tv for a little and everything seems to be fine. I looked over at my right arm and my arm fuses into my sheets. They are connected as one, and it was hard to tell where my sheets ended and my arm began. I remember that I have taken these psychoactive seeds and laugh at the distortion, it was relieving to know that they had started to kick in.     Here is where time gets a little hard to keep track of, so the time for the rest of these posts are just estimates. After enjoying the visual regarding my arm, I relax and things start to feel a little foggy. I\'m smiling a lot and feel warm throughout my entire body and an overall boost in mood. I tried to stay up for as long as I can to enjoy my trip, but I eventually pass out.     When I come to, I feel extremely out of it. I assume that it is still night, and think I could have been out for 5 minutes or possibly hours. I quickly notice that I am paralyzed for the most part. I feel so weak that I can only slightly move my neck from side to side. In the top of the room, floating in each of the four corners of my bedroom, I notice what I can only describe to be as oddly shaped creatures I had never seen before. They were  each a different color, red, blue, green, and yellow. They didn\'t seem to have any bones and I could never get a good look at their faces. I knew what I was looking at were aliens, so naturally I was terrified. Each of these beings was sitting on a chair and had a desk and computer they were tending to. All of them floating, desk, chair and all. Then suddenly, my point of view starts to shift, and before I know it I\'m looking down on my body laying on my bed. My point of view then shifts to the red beings\' computer monitor. It is playing a game, where I am it\'s character. It was like standing behind someone watching them play Sims and I was their avatar, laying motionless on my bed. I can\'t really think any thoughts, I was just mesmerized of what I was seeing. I then pass out again.    When I woke up, I was in the fetal position in the middle of my bed. My head was on fire and my stomach was about to burst open, I was in agony. Then what I had seen with the aliens sets in, and the bad thoughts started. It occurred to me that my entire life could be a program made for the entertainment for some other superior being. Everything in existence could be erased, wiped out forever without a warning if the being playing my game decided to turn off the game. My life felt meaningless, and I fell into a very sudden depression. I didn\'t want to wake up the next morning because what\'s the point? There may not even be a tomorrow to wake up for.     I contemplated my very existence for quite some time. Then the stomach pains hit 10x harder than before. I managed to get up and stumble to the bathroom to prepare to vomit. I dry heaved, but no actual vomit. I felt so sick and was in the worst mental state I had been in in my entire life. I laid down on the hard tire and begged for my own death. I have never been suicidal and am generally at a good place mentally, but at the time I really wished that I was dead. I wanted to be dead so the unbearable pain would end and because of the mental mindfuck I had just gone through. I determine that I am not going to puke and stumble back to my bed and pass out.    I woke up the next morning with a new kind of hangover that puts regular alcohol induced hangovers to shame. I mostly rested in bed and tried to recover. The mental toll this bad trip had on me still effects me to this day, almost 3 years later. The mental toll this bad trip had on me still effects me to this day, almost 3 years later. I have taken great strides to feel normal after going through this experience but not all the mental scares have healed up all the way yet. I never took the seeds again, and don\'t plan to. This was my only bad trip with any drug, and have since had very pleasant experiences with other psychedelic substances.  <!-- If anybody reads this, some word of advice:If you are considering trying these seeds, I would highly suggest you reconsider. If you decide to do them anyway, -->I would stick to regular doses and definitely not take anywhere near 13 seeds."
106740,An Enjoyably Quiet Afternoon,Dan,"Aug 20, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"I believe this is my fourth experience with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose (HBWR) seeds, although it may be my fifth or sixth.  I have also had three or four experiences with LSD, the most recent of which was about 6 years ago.  My last HBWR experience was probably 7 or 8 years ago.    Followed  ""Simple Nausea Free LSA Extraction Technique"" method of LSA extraction (cold water).<!-- : http://disregardeverythingisay.com/post/17272859336/simple-nausea-free-lsa-extraction-technique-->    Used a mortar and pestle to grind 12 seeds.  Did not bother to scrape them first.  I purchased these seeds online -- $8.99 US for about 100 seeds (10 g).  Delivery was free but very slow, with the seeds arriving about 12 days after I ordered them.    After grinding, I mixed the resulting powder into about 4 oz. of water that had been boiled, left to cool, and poured into a plastic water bottle.  Covered the bottle with foil and left it in the refrigerator overnight--total \'soak time\' was about 20 hours.  Shook the bottle a few times during this period. total \'soak time\' was about 20 hours.  Shook the bottle a few times during this period.  Water became very dark--nearly black.  Added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic (from a jar) and left it in the bottle for about 45 minutes, shaking the bottle three or four times during this period.  Filtered the water through a paper coffee filter, then added about 8 oz. of orange juice.    Drank the resulting concoction on an empty stomach and fairly quickly--one sip to taste, then two quick chugs.  Ingestion occurred at approximately 12:22 PM.    Mild nausea around 15-20 minutes after ingestion.  One visit to the bathroom where I felt like I might vomit, but did not.    Smoked some cannabis around 40 minutes after ingestion--only a single one-hitter, but that is my most common dose.  Felt like this helped with (but did not completely eliminate) the nausea.  Felt first pleasant sensations (that I attribute to the HBWR seeds and not the cannabis) around 50 minutes after ingestion.  Began documenting the experience around 1:15 PM.    1:41 PM - nausea has mostly subsided and trip has definitely begun.  Not sure whether the garlic was actually effective, but this is probably the least nauseating experience I have had with HBWR.    2:02 PM - stepped outside for a cigarette.  Nausea increased a little, but not so much as to make me feel like I was going to vomit.  Seems to have subsided now.  While outside, I experienced some fairly pleasant tingling in my limbs.  The head trip has been enjoyable so far.    3:39 PM - still enjoying the trip.  Nausea has not returned.  I would recommend the method of preparation and ingestion that I used.    5:11 PM - almost five hours into the trip.  No cannabis in the last four hours; no cigarettes in the last three.  Body sensations are pretty strong... muscles feel kind of sore, as though I had recently finished a workout.  Have had moments in the last hour or so where I felt slightly nauseated, but those feelings have passed fairly quickly.  In between, I\'ve felt hungry, but still have not eaten anything all day.    7:30 PM - ate a good-sized dinner, and this effectively ended the trip.  It had been waning for the previous 90-120 minutes."
113345,Shifting and Folding,Anonymous,"Jul 23, 2019","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Nitrous Oxide","At the time of writing this its been 24 hours since my trip. It was very visual surpassing even LSD. I blended up 11 hbwr seeds of the Hawaiian strain, I read that they are more potent.     -0:00   I poured the powder on my tongue and washed it down with a ginger ale. I would also like to mention that I hadn\'t eaten since the previous day to help with nausea.     -0:10   nausea kicked in. It wasn\'t overwhelming but definitely not fun    -0:20   Slight body tingles could have been placebo    -0:30  definitely tripping and 75% of nausea has disappeared. A little anxiety from the come up.     -0:50  smoked some weed to help with the nausea. It is now 100% gone. I\'m now getting slight visuals similar to my stronger LSA trips when I\'ve mixed them with weed. Already a very strong trip and this worried me slightly as I knew this one was going to get intense. The visuals mostly consisted of colors around the borders of objects, reflections of light, and tracers from moving my hand back and forth.     -1:00  I filled a balloon with one can of nitrous and inhaled it and held it in as long as I could. I saw the wood on my porch separate into four section, and then into eight. They started curving and then, ""snapped"" for lack of a better word. When this happened I saw the same section of wood form triangles that filled my vision. They had waves of colors inside of them.     -1:05  After the nitrous wore off I experienced increased visuals that didn\'t subside. It was nice. Not overwhelming at all. Most of my visuals only took place if I stopped and looked at something. The floor appeared wavy at times, the walls were breathing slightly, and the clouds were shifting around.    -1:30  Being alone I got bored being at the house very quickly. I didn\'t really need anything from the store but I figured I would walk there and maybe something cool would happen, because the craziest things always seem to fall into place when you\'re tripping. Well my neighbor a couple houses down was pulling put of his driveway. Now we have had problems before where I thought a fight could break out so I figured I would approach him and see if we could put it behind us. We talked for a second and we agreed it was stupid and we actually introduced ourselves. I told him I was tripping really hard. He said he was just trying to find something to do so he pulled back in to his driveway and invited me in. Long story short I realized he was tweaking pretty hard and it was really putting me in a bad headspace. I told him I just needed to go and walk around and headed out the door.    -2:00 I was definitely headed into a bad trip at this point with many negative thoughts and a lot of anxiety. I wanted to go home and do what nitrous I had left to kind of reset me mentally as thats what it felt like happened the first time. I loaded up 4 balloons and took them all in back to back while making sure I was still getting oxygen.     -2:05 I dont remember very much. I just remember crazy visuals and rapid thoughts on an insane, impossible, and indescribable level. It felt like it over six seconds. Everything was explained, I understood, and then it was ripped away from me in an instant. I remember becoming intertwined in some sort of frequency that we aren\'t normally capable of understanding. I remember becoming intertwined in some sort of frequency that we aren\'t normally capable of understanding. It wasn\'t part of me and I have never felt it before, but for the moment we were one. I was pure energy is the best way I could really describe it.    -2:15  I still feel like I just inhaled a balloon. The visuals have intensified to a point I have never experienced on any other drug. Regardless of what was going on my vision was splitting apart and morphing together. If I looked away it would stop for about a third of a second and then immediately come back full force. These visuals were pretty unique. They all in some way consisted of shifting and folding. For example. I sat on my porch and the wood was splitting apart in four square sections, the sections were always recognizable at first but within about 3 seconds would become so twisted and distorted I couldn\'t tell what I was looking at. Each section was doing something different, some would rotate, some would fold into themselves, some would form different geometric shapes, and some had constantly changing patterns. They all had a rainbow color texture to them in some way. I became very exhausted mentally very quickly. It was just too much for my brain to process for such a long time.    -4:00   I\'m beyond exhausted. I\'m not freaking out but definitely would like it to end. I started to come down slightly and the visuals started to die down but were still intense. I\'m becoming more aware of my body now. I feel intense sedation. Similar to a strong dose of xanax. I want to take some kratom to hopefully help me come down a little bit but its too much of a challenge to move. I feel the vaso-constriction for the first time in the whole trip. I can\'t stop clenching my stomach, and my legs are tense. It takes a conscious effort to relax my body. I try to go to sleep but the visuals are stimulating me too much and I am unable to do it.     -5:00   Somebody I know comes over and I force myself to answer the door. I hand them my weed and they pack a bowl for me. They leave and I feel much better physically. The visuals became a little stronger again but it was worth it to get rid of the uncomfortable body clenching.     -10:00   The rest of the trip I layed down and tried to enjoy it. I drank a little bit of alcohol and this helped as well. I finally ended up getting to sleep around this time.     I was still having slight visuals when I woke up about 20 hours after my dose. All in all it was a great trip. I wanted to try a large dose and thats what I did. The only part that was overwhelmingly unpleasant was the vaso-constriction at the end. I wouldn\'t reccomend dosing so high. I think that seven or eight seeds would have been more comfortable. It was just extremely exhausting watching reality get ripped apart like that for so long. I will definetly try a large dose again at some point but it won\'t be for a long time."
112882,It Goes Way Deeper Than Visuals,JR,"Jul 17, 2019","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Alcohol","Im 19 and a male. Earlier in the day I prepared the mixture by crushing 6 seeds with a hammer and adding that to an empty water bottle. I then added a tablespoon of water and a tablespoon of orange juice to the empty bottle. I shook the bottle hard for a minute and left it in a dark drawer for 3 hours.    Before I tell you how it felt, just know Id researched everything I could find about LSA and HBWS, ranging from trip reports to extraction methods to Terence McKennas thoughts on Morning glories<!--  which are similar but you need a lot of them-->. I have tried some other psychedelics like magic truffles and acid, the truffles made it so I basically couldnt talk haha but in a good way of course!     The acid felt very very alien, I think I got some strong strong stuff, I remember seeing lots and lots of floating imagery like spinning cash symbols and stuff, and when Id look at something things would happen to it like the wall I could see the wall moving like insects, very freaky stuff! I took a hit of a bong like I normally do when I was in this state, and it completely smashed me, I remember looking back down at my weed and seeing tiny green alien like catapillars crawling around, so my weed was literally running from me haha. Other that its just a very strong experience visually, and on the body I got a feeling like a restless feeling in my lower back and everything felt alive around me, plants are always alive but this made it feel like everything was breathing and moving such as the walls and carpet. I remember closing my eyes and seeing a colony of people in a 2D painting, and they were recycling water using gears and I got a feeling of infinite sustainability and it felt peaceful. <!-- I just wanted to write that to let you guys know that Ive expereinced some fairly strong psycadelic trips, perhaps not on par with some peoples trips but I defnetly felt the power of the substance. -->    So the LSA, after leaving it for 3 hours I put a t-shirt over a cup, and then slowly poured the liquid in the water bottle into that cup, the t-shirt was catching the seeds for me. I thought 6 would be a low dose not expecting anything major just because of how drug laws are and it tricks your mind like oh I got this legally it cant do anything right? Wrong!     I drunk the liquid at 5:30PM, didnt feel anything until 6PM when I got that feeling that something is coming on. This come on took about another hour and a half it felt like, then I started to feel the spacey body feeling, seeing tracers in the movement and I noticed my FOV seemed further back, things looked sharper and more saturated, when looking at the TV there was a little blur over lights.     At this point Im feeling the strength of it so I decided to have a bong. This bumped things up a little bit. Voices in my house became more sensitive, everything was more sensitive it felt like. It felt like I could appreciate things more and think about what I needed in great detail, but this could also work against me if I were an anxious person. And thats what happened to me, I hadnt done acid in a long time and when this hit me it brought all my memorys of what I thought about when I was on it back. I just got this overwhelming feeling of, I wouldnt say sadness, but definitely a feeling of my life could be better, my decision making needs to change as well as my routines, all these thoughts came on instantly. It was very overwhelming and I did start to panic a little bit. Just the clarity felt too much for me at this moment in my life the clarity felt too much for me at this moment in my life. A good way to put it is like, to get to the point of strong strong visuals its like passing a test with your mind, and if you have no worries then great! It will be amazing experience, but for me it was too overwhelming and made me sad for a bit there.     After about 30 mins of feeling this way and waiting it out it just got more intense ya know, getting that crying feeling even when Im fighting against it as hard as I can, just getting thoughts and suggestions for my every day life, it was a lot more than I was expecting. Once I felt this way I knew that this is a powerful chemical and if one has no problems in one\'s life then its good but I realised that these truly arent recreation drugs man. Sure the visuals and stuff are but its a lot more than that it goes way deeper than that. And if I have stuff to do the next day, or anything like that I could get stuck in a loop of not being able to sleep in my bed and I dont want that. It just made me appreciate the chemical for what it is, and opened my eyes. I chase highs, nothing serious but I do smoke a lot of weed and Im realising that now. It made me realise that drugs give me this one state of mind, but being normal is its own state of mind and in that moment all I wanted was to be normal again and be with my family with normal pupils.     I had some alcohol nothing hard just a Smirnoff like ice lemonade thing and I downed some in an effort to reduce the strength of the trip or just to cut it all in all. To my surprise it did help a lot, it calmed my nerves down and I started to feel more normal again and felt I could talk normally again. After this I relaxed with my sister and have never felt happier to be around her, I felt like I could feel what she felt when I was on the drug, it made me see peoples perspectives like I was them and it made me realise some things I need to do. To be a role model to her and get out of my own interests like this. Id never felt so happy to be with her, Im always happy when Im with her but this was like a Im so so relieved to be feeling normal again and thinking straight. So I relaxed with her until 11.30pm Id say, then I put a stream on and actually fell asleep. I dreamt of having a girlfriend again and hugging her in bed, I took from this that my brain was telling me I feel a little lonely maybe who knows. I woke up without dilated pupils and didnt feel tired like I normally do. Normally Im up until 4 and I cant get out of this loop of gaming and smoking and gaming and sleep for 3 hours and waking up feeling awful. I felt like this night I had my normal sleep feeling I havent felt in ages I felt like this night I had my normal sleep feeling I havent felt in ages, and I think thats very positive for me. All the thoughts I got are with me right now, I remembers all of them and I am going to make changes where I need to. After laying down in bed I felt cleansed and happy to be normal.     To finish I just want to say that if you are thinking of using something like this, just be aware of whats going on in your life and be ready to think about things you maybe didnt want to whilst tripping. This isnt a crappy legal high type of deal, its very strong and feels just like LSD did for me, only difference being that the visuals werent like what I described before, but that might be because I drunk the alcohol to end the trip when it was really picking up. Ive no doubt I would have had some visuals but still nothing as freaky as the acid I tried. <!-- If you try this and have a clear mindset and arent paranoid about family members seeing your pupils, do what I did you will have a great time, -->    It felt like lsd and was very profound in how I felt. <!-- But if you do have a bit of a jumbled mindset right now, do yourself a favour and hold off on this. It will always be there (hopefully) and just wait till you know its right. You could try 1 or two seeds but I honestly think it will still lead to the same feelings but I guess you could try. Just be careful and relax, have -->Having some alcohol nearby  was the life saver for me, after 2 minutes I felt better and more normal <!-- so if you still try this have some nearby because--> in my experience it did help diminish the effects of the LSA. I had a good experience, I wanted to trip and see cool visuals but now I realise its a lot more than that, theres later to the experience and the first one is my thoughts and stuff to get to the cool visuals. I got these seeds [online], <!-- youll know the ones to get make sure they are -->organic and untreated. <!-- Be safe have fun and dont underestimate any psycadelic you try including but to a lesser extent, weed.--> Id been feeling unmotivated for a while before this trip, and a bit down I guess, after the trip I feel refreshed and positive and my mindset has changed. Amazing. <!-- Thanks for reading this I hope it gives you an insight into the effects of these seeds at the dosage I had. -->"
85046,Never. Ever. Again,swim,"Jul 10, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"I bought these seeds from a shop in Camden market, the salesman said this was the best legal highs he had to offer and, for some absurd reason I trusted him. I had read on the internet that is was the skin of the seeds that made you feel sick, so I scratched them off and then chewed the seeds and kept them in my mouth for a few minutes before swallowing.    In preparation before taking the seeds I had also read on the internet that you shouldnt eat before because it would make you more likely to throw up, so instead I just drank some camomile tea to calm my stomach. Looking back on it now I realise that it was probably the biggest mistake to make. I was aware that some people on the internet had had bad experiences before my, but due to the majority of them being good experiences, I ignored the few warnings that were given.     So I took about 6 seeds at around 12 in the afternoon.    12:10 Almost immediately after taking the seeds (around 10 minutes) I threw up. At that time I was annoyed because I thought I may not get the full effect of the seeds, so I proceeded to take another 1 using the same method as before.    1:00 At first I didnt feel anything, and didnt think the seeds were going to work.    2:00 2 hours after ingesting the seeds I felt the first effects. 2 hours after ingesting the seeds I felt the first effects. It wasnt very strong, however not having taken LSD before I has nothing to compare it to. Colours seemed to be brighter and it seemed as if I was looking at everything in pop art form. I also felt as if my mind was clearer and I was more able to think, the spaces in-between words particularly fascinated me. This lasted about half an hour.    2:30 From now on the experience goes severely down hill.  I started feeling ill again, and I would go to throw up but seeing as I hadnt eaten anything,  it was just gagging. My pupils were huge, and whenever I moved I felt sick again, and would try and throw up again, but to no avail. This continues for 2 hours, until it gets to the point where I cant move at all, I tried to go up the stairs but couldnt even manage that without dry throwing up. The nausea comes and goes in phases, and I thinks I feel better but then the nausea feeling only gets worse again.    4:30 Now I decided I has to try and eat something so that I can get the seeds out of my system. I tries to eat some bread and drink water, but every time I throw it up straight away. The next 5 hours are a big blur of sickness. Constantly throwing up in like 20 minute intervals. I think to myself why the hell I tried these god forsaken seeds, and how amazing the human body actually is. Its incredible how the body tried to get the seeds of my system.      This is pretty much all I remember thinking these few hours.  All I wanted to do was to go to hospital and get my stomach pumped, but I couldnt move anywhere and was shaking. I literally felt as if I was going to die  and vowed never to take long lasting drugs again because I had no control over my body. There was absolutely nothing I could do, and I was completely helpless.    9:00 finally I throw up properly, in a few big heaves. Suddenly I feels a little better and try to occupy my mind by watching Friends. I eats a few cherries.    11:00 feel sick again and throw up again. This is by far the most I have thrown up throughout the whole experience. Probably more this one time then all the rest put together. After this I finally feell better again. Although there is still slight nausea, heaven compared to what I felt before.    12:00 havent thrown up since, feeling better all the time although unbelievably tired.    So basically, 9 constant hours of puking.

86503,My Living Room Turned Into a Hell Furnace,Quetzalcoatl,"May 26, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Traumatic Experience (Have a Sitter Present!)    Purchased 8 HBWR seeds inorder to try a form of therapeutic session with a serotonergic psychedelic (I have personal issues for which I wanted a new perspective).    Previous psychedelic experience: Salvia divinorum (mostly positive experiences)  Setting: home, late evening.    10.45 PM ingesting 4 seeds by thoroughly chewing with water and keeping it in my mouth for a minute, then swallowing.    11.15 no overt effects, feeling slightly different though, like there\'s something amiss but I can\'t formulate it in words    11.30 all of a sudden I feel like I have the mind of a small child, cramping of legs, nausea but I feel I can avoid this by concentrating on other things    11.45 the previous feeling abates, effects intensify, some deeply sexual material comes up, I decide to ingest 2 more seeds in order to have a more profound effects.    12.00 I\'m having very intense bodily sensations, pupils extremely dilated, I decide what the heck and take 2 more    00.15 AM I genuinely feel like I\'m experiencing full blown psychosis, I get worried and write myself a paper note that I have ingested LSA and the effects will eventually cease in case I might forget this (this proves later to be very USEFUL!)    00.30 I have some good and bad moments. I feel as though all inhibitions of my personality have been removed and I\'m experiencing a form of true freedom. However in the background I get slight paranoia that I\'m doing something wicked.    00.45 Effects deepen. I\'m feeling that there is no difference between the universe and myself, the whole universe is god and I\'m god...for some reason this realization makes me lonely and I\'m starting to get slightly depressed.    1.00 Closed eye visuals (geometric shapes) start to emerge now with more power, I decide to retreat to bed and observe these more thoroughly.    1.30-3.00 The feelings of being everything intensify but all of a sudden the trip takes a turn for the worse. I seem to think that I am stuck in a neverending carrousel of tripping. This is accompanied by visual experience of being aware of everything at once (difficult to describe). I feel like a failure and that I\'m a bad person and because of this I\'m experiencing this. The feelings of entrapment intensify and I start to panic. I feel very depressed, thoughts of suicide run through my head which drive me into more panic (I have actually no desire to die). I feel that I\'m arriving to a dark part of the universe...into hell. When I open my eyes I see that my living room has turned into a hell furnace and a devil-like head is laughing at me. After this everything becomes blurry. I seem to remember that I felt as though I was having a seizure at one point (which I think I actually didn\'t have but my head just felt on fire). I constantly look at the paper note I wrote in order to confirm to myself that this will eventually stop (this is very helpful in calming me a bit).    4.00 The mental torture seems to slowly lose potency. Although the rest of the trip continues to be very unpleasant.    5.00 I feel as though I have survived and there\'s still hope that things will be allright.    6.00 The trip has ended. I feel suddenly very peaceful and realize that everything I experienced was a manifestation of my troubled psyche.     6-9.00 Sleeping with previous nightmares, I\'m afraid I might have a PTSD after this (although that doesn\'t really happen, 2 days have passed and I\'m OK).    The next day I deeply analyze the experience and even though the whole thing was eventually a mental rape, I see it all as a painful lesson from which I have learned useful things about myself (e.g. I tend to be selfish and felt how terrible such a state is) and details I will not go into here now.    All in all I learned that I want to have<!--would highly recommend having--> a sitter present when experimenting with such long duration psychedelics as the possibility of forgetting I have taken a drug and that the experience will eventually end is very much a real possibility. Fortunately I do not consider the experience a complete failure but I would not try this again without somebody being present."
90834,All Things in Harmony,squirp,"May 17, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"I was looking forward to a good trip, and this mindset may have improved my experience.     I had scraped and flamed my HBW seeds prior to use. At 1 pm, about 45 minutes before using any seeds, I took one caplet of long-acting Gravol (dramamine). At around 1:45 I thoroughly chewed 3 seeds, then held them between my teeth for what I had intended to be about 20 minutes, but ended up being about an hour since I got distracted. Then I spit the chewed seeds out. Already I was starting to trip: I was using the computer and colour appeared brighter, and the windows appeared 3-dimensional. At this point I started drinking an energy drink to counteract the drowsiness from the seeds and the dramamine. Sat down to watch TV, which looked high-definition even though my television is not HD.     At 3:30 I chewed 2 more seeds and held them in my mouth (only 20 minutes this time), then 1 more at 4:30.     At this point I had started to become aware that unrelated things were moving in time with one another I had started to become aware that unrelated things were moving in time with one another- my cat moved in time with the music and dialogue on the TV, and so did passing cars on the street below, which I could see through my balcony window. I was filled with an overwhelming sense that all of the world was in harmony and all things were as they should be. In addition, colours had now become very bright, and rainbow effects like haloes appeared around various things. I had very little loss of coordination, or disturbing distortion of my own face in the mirror. I kept the television tuned to upbeat and positive shows, and I\'m sure this improved my trip.     When the trip was wearing out around 9:30, I took two 100 mg 5-HTP tablets, and after a little bit of restlessness, had a peaceful sleep and awoke with no ill effects.     This trip changed my perceptions and my outlook on life!"

I have a fairly extensive history of hallucinogen usage excepting mushrooms and all current RCs minus Methylone. My mindset was mildly irritable and slightly tired but, the extraction needed to be tested. I take no prescriptions but do take fenugreek supplements.    Prep:  1. I scraped the fuzzy hairs off of the outside with my fingernails, it seems if I broke the seams at the edge of the seeds it flaked off easily. Though some seeds would not release the fuzz! They went back in the bag. 6 seeds total for me.    2. Ground to a fine powder in coffee grinder.    3. Mixed with 1/2 oz distilled water and 1/8 of a limes juice in a dark glass bottle, shook the crud out of it and put in fridge. Let set 24 hours shaking when I remembered.    4. At 24 hours I chopped up 1 garlic clove and put in bottle, continued shaking as I remembered. Allowed to set another 24 hours in fridge.    5. Strained mixture through cheesecloth. Squeezed gently to get the last bit out of solids then discarded seed matter and garlic. Washed out bottle then put the liquid back in and it went back into the fridge.    Now I am unsure of how unstable LSA is in this form, I may have had a milder experience because I waited another 24 hours before dozing. The mix reeked of garlic but, the purpose was to use the sulphur compounds to break down the cyanide precursers to avoid nausea.     I mixed it with about 6oz of Acai berry juice and sipped over the course of 20 min. I had also fasted since breakfast. It was 8:05 when I started drinking it. I had some extremely mild nausea but I think it was due to hunger and the lingering garlic taste honestly.    9:25 first noticeable visual change, subtle glowy nice.    10:00 begin to feel a bit giggly and just plain nice in my body.    10:45 starting to really get these waves of pleasure and this feels so familiar!    Suddenly it 1:30 am.... I have no idea how time flashed by but, it was fun! Feels like if LSD and MDMA almost. All body minimal visual change just enough to know it is there. And even though my body feels good, my skin is kinda numb like on acid. The whole night was just so pleasant!     3:00am tired now think I can sleep.    Ended up reading for about an hour and then falling asleep easily. Had vivid sex dreams that kinda freaked me out a bit..... overall awesome experience. I think next time I will not use the whole garlic clove for such a small amount of liquid and I will not fast for as long. Oh and I was able to eat fine but, food was not all that tasty.     <!--PLEASE DO NOT JUST EAT THE SEEDS! IT WILL NOT BE PLEASANT!!! -->Eating the seeds would not have been pleasant."
112989,Communicating with God,Brody G.,"Apr 10, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Background:  I am well experienced with psychedelics. I\'ll try just about anything once. I like to be alone when I trip, although I understand that this is not recommended, especially if there is a possibility of losing yourself in the trip.     I have tripped on HBWR seeds many times before this particular experience. The first time I tried them, I ate 10 seeds, which became my standard dose. I never bothered scraping the outer coating or making extractions or any of that. I simply crushed the seeds into a coarse pile of crumbs and swallowed them.     To make a long story short, I discovered that HBWR seeds are a double-edged sword: on the one hand, my mind expands, like opening the aperture on a telescope, but at the same time, it comes with intense nausea and stomach cramps. At the peak of the trip, perfect understanding comes to me. For a brief moment, the universe and reality will make sense, I can feel Love, I can feel the presence of God. But when I finally come down, it feels more like a dream and the insights slowly fade. I can feel Love, I can feel the presence of God. But when I finally come down, it feels more like a dream and the insights slowly fade. Music and art are absolutely mind blowing and feelings of euphoria wash over me. But again, it is balanced with nausea and painful stomach cramps.    One More Piece of Backstory:  As far as I know, I have never heard of anyone dying from HBWR seeds, so for the trip before my most recent experience, I decided to increase the dosage to 15 seeds, just to see what might happen. Again, no special preparations except crushing and swallowing the seeds. All the same feelings and sensations came back as I described above.     It takes about 1-3 hours to peak. But this time something happened that I was not expecting and which terrified me. Simply put, I died. As I stated at the beginning, I cant say for sure if that is what happened, I am only saying that this is what it felt like. I had laid down face first on the floor and shut my eyes because it helps me ignore some of the nausea and stomach pain. But when I opened my eyes, the room was still. I was still. I was dead. Time stopped. I felt the presence of God enter me. Together we looked back on my life and watched some of the highlights, focusing on some major events that shaped my life. It didnt really take that long, but after it was over I became very sad. I didnt really want to die.    Many people say they are ready to die, and they do foolish things to test that belief, but the reality is, you never really know if youre ready to die until its happening. <!--Panic and terror can wash over you if you didnt go into the trip with the mindset of whatever happens, happens. But regardless, -->I felt very sad at the prospect of dying and told God that there were still things I wanted to do. God told me I didnt have to die, all I had to do was breath. And in that moment, I realized I wasnt breathing. I took in a massive lung of air and starting to come back. Everything was fine after that. Breathing still had to be done manually, for the most part, but if you practice breathing meditation its not so difficult to deal with. Its also worth noting that I didnt sleep for 3 days afterwards.    Now With 20 Seeds:  As I said, its only what it felt like. Im sure it wasnt literal, actual death, so it allowed me to remain confident enough to try again, this time with 20 seeds. Once more, lightly crushed and swallowed. These two trips were about half a year apart. HBWR seeds are too intense to do frequently, and even then, I am not kidding, these seeds are no joke, IT IS PAINFUL. I had to gather up a lot of courage to do it. It takes about 1-3 hours to peak. The way I get through the trips is to lay in bed with the lights off and listen to uplifting music. I keep something nearby in case I need to throw up. I keep some water nearby because I might become dehydrated. I know its disgusting, but I also keep a container nearby to urinate in. It can be tremendously difficult to walk far enough to make it to the bathroom, especially when I need to concentrate on breathing and not having a panic attack and standing up makes me dizzy. But the most important part of getting through this trip is to have an unshakable faith that no matter what physical discomforts I am going through, I will eventually return to baseline. DO NOT PANIC. Remember to breath, and the pain and the trip will pass with time.    Now you may ask: why? Why go through this hellish nightmare of a trip? Is it really worth it? <!--My answer is this: DONT DO IT. Unless you are incredibly brave and have a high tolerance for pain, it will not be worth it. But t-->The reason why I keep suffering through hell for a psychedelic insight is because I believe it to be thematic of life. Wisdom cannot be gained without an understanding of what it means to be wrong. Tranquility cannot be gained without an understanding of suffering. Growth cannot be gained without an understanding of pain. During the peak of the trip when stomach cramps were the worst, that is when I started to regret having eaten the seeds and when I became desperate enough to call out to God to take the pain away. Thats when the presence of God washed over me and helped me get through the experience.    What happened next is impossible to put into words, but Ill try. Maybe the words will speak to you, maybe not.     God communicated with me, in a language of feeling. This is why I always listen to uplifting music, because God can speak through the music. God was speaking to me through all my sensual inputs. God let me know that everything was going to be fine if I only had faith. Communicating with God was sort of like looking at a beautiful painting. Everyone sees it differently. I was only able see what I was ready to comprehend. I understood why God created the Universe, why evil is allowed to exist, why pain exists. God did it because despite all the negative consequences, there exists something within this reality that is so beautiful, so glorious, so wonderful, that it justifies everything: Love. Not the simple, shallow version of love that we humans casually toss around here on Earth, but Love. Gods Love. And it is Gods Love that defies the impossible. Gods Love is so powerful and so beautiful that it can create a Universe out of nothing. It defeats Death itself. And when I comprehended this Love, a bliss washed over me. I sobbed uncontrollably because it was so astonishingly beautiful, and God, who is so powerful and benevolent, gave up a tiny slice of infinite time to share it with me. God told me that it is my purpose here to seek out that Love, to learn to cultivate it in myself, so that I might be One with God in Eternity.    Thats what it felt like anyway.    I can\'t remember that many specific details, because that is the nature of the trip. At one point I did throw up when I tried to stand. After that, I spent about 6 hours or so in bed just listening to music sort of half asleep, contemplating life. I had to breath manually. I had to occasionally move my arms and legs to shake out numbness. My heart beat was elevated. It felt like I was on the verge of dying, but I always remained confident that it was just in my head. I didn\'t get much sleep the first night, but I slept for 12 hours straight each of the following two nights.    I dont recommend trying HBWR seeds. It took me about 72 hours to really return back to baseline. I had an overwhelming compulsion to adopt a religion and preach on social media to my family and friends about God, but after three days when I finally came back down, the only thing that was left was a memory, like a dream, and I wondered, did it really happen?    I\'m not sure if I will ever do it again. It\'s just so difficult to get through the experience. Honestly I think I\'ve learned as much as I want to know from the seeds. So in conclusion, let me say this: there\'s nothing like suffering to make you appreciate the good times, and there\'s nothing like dying to make you appreciate life."
67513,Finally They Work,Aussie Tripper,"Mar 31, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Hi, I am an male aussie 25, I have been experimenting with LSA for a while now (6 years), I have tried H.B. Woodrose seeds =8-10, ololouqui seeds =15 and morning glory seeds =75-150, all of my former experiments were either ground and swallowed, and ground and soaked in water. All of my LSA experiences were very mild but highly sedating, which led me to beleive LSA was a SEDATIVE, last night changed my mind tenfold.    Preperation- I scraped all the hairy stuff off and ground seeds as fine as I could using an electric peppermill, soaked seeds in about 70mls water and a teaspoon of sweet vinegar than put the  glass into the freezer to form an icecube, then I let them thaw in the fridge for an hour.    Setting- I had drunk 2 beers 1 1/2 hours before trying the seeds (Aussie Religon), I had also smoked a bit of weed during the day but  laid off it in the afternoon(I find it fogs trips in the early peak, but great 3 hours later). It was my day off work, my girlfriend was at work, I was very relaxed and enjoying my day off. I should also add I was skeptical of anything but a good sleep from the seeds!    Ingestion- drunk all liquid at 7-15pm this was the last time I could see the clock.    Effects- (0-1 hours) Giddiness, enhanced colour and a kind of tickling surge through my body wittin 30 minutes,  I was watching the simpsons and as I started tripping the colour was to much for me, I shut my eyes and slept for 30 minutes.    (1-3 hours) I woke up and stood up I had bad motor skills, then I remembered I took the seeds, I had to lay back down and spent most of the night there. Hallucinations were strong distortions of walls and picture, my ceiling looked like it wasn\'t there just stars and sky (my ceiling is white rough concrete). All this time I had unpleasent tickling.I had to turn the  t.v. Off, people talking was to much for my ears to handle. Eventually the good outweighed the bad and I became quite euphoric.    (3-4 hours) smoked a bit of weed and started tripping pretty hard, everything was wavy and moving and I could kind of get up without instantly wanting to lay back down, very euphoric. My girlfriend came home and instantly knew I was tripping.    (5-8 hours) I slowly came down, had quite pleasent after effects, eventually tried to sleep but got out of bed about   1-00am I was very exhausted but couldn\'t sleep till 4-00am I think (couldn\'t see clock to well)    Written 05 dec 2007 by Aussie Tripper"
71815,Purged Orange Juice Through My Nostrils,chef,"Feb 14, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"My friend A. had been acquiring a stash of psychedelics for a while now and had 2 bottles of san pedro cactus  juice,  7 grams mushrooms, and an approximate water extraction of 10-15 baby woodrose seeds in his freezer. We had been planning a night trip with my other friend B. For a while and finally felt we were ready to go... Then another opportunity arose for some LSD so we decided to go after that instead.. After alot of useless negotiations all we bought was 1 hit since the seller was not willing to part with our original agreed number of 6 hits.     Since B. was not experienced with many psychedelics other then mushrooms and did not want to eat mushrooms we gave the hit to her. A. Decided to mix his mushrooms with some syrian rue he also had. I do not know the dosage level of the syrian rue since I myself am not familar with it, but A. took an accurate amount in capsules to contend with 2.5 grams of mushrooms he ingested.     I myself am quite familiar with most drugs excluding intravenous injections, but am most familiar with psychedelics. Since I did not want to trip as the only one on mescaline, I thought it would be a good idea to try the LSA for the first time. (I have dropped acid before a few times with great enjoyment) hoping to duplicate the LSD effects for the natural LSA  I was excited to get the trip underway so I could view natures true version of the human based synthetic acid.     We all took our substances at 2 A.M. (quite late to start, but only time made available for all 3 of us to gather in my dorm room). A. mixed his mushrooms with some yogurt to eat, which I thought quite strange as I normally just eat the mushrooms, I prefer to feel what I am putting in my body before it enters, which was surprisingly not the case for how I took the seeds. Since A. had the seeds prepared in a water dose for me that was previously in his freezer I decided to put the slushy seed residue in a glass of orange juice and drink it all right away. It was perfectly fine going down, I did not think to swirl it under my tongue or in my mouth and spit it out but to swallow the mixture.     After approximately 2 hours at 4 A.M. we all had begun coming up on our own substances and were all in our own mindsets, some trance music and visualizer were turned on and not a single word was spoken for around 30 minutes. Thats when A. started to curl up in a giant blanket and hide from the world, B. started smiling and I started to notice C.E.V\'s and a slight nausea arising in my stomach.     Within 10 minutes I had the same light distortion open eye hallucinations that tell me I am about to get high on mushrooms or acid. This is when I actually split myself into 2 emotions, the one that was about to start pacing and sweating and shaking then stumble to the bathroom and violently puke as hard as humanly possible and the other one that was getting a relaxed body buzz and chillin out to the web patterns and kaleidoscope visuals that were beginning to branch up and over the walls as my vision distorted and contorted from the sides of my eyes to the middle of my vision in perfect shape of a giant human eye.     That\'s when I decided to rush to the bathroom and puke my guts out. Since I had hardly eaten anything for the last 7 hours except the seeds, some orange juice, and some water a mostly liquid mixture was squeezed from the deepest pits of my stomach through my throat and forced out my mouth and up through my sinus and out my nose into the toilet. Yes it\'s gross but it was necessary to point out the fact that my body felt so strongly of getting rid of this unknown substance, that it made me retch harder then it even allowed itself to be practical. I will tell you that orange juice is a very nasty thing to burn your nasal passage, I mean ketamine, oxy, blow, and E mixed together would have felt awesome in there, compared to the orange juice let alone orange juice that left bitter tasting woodrose chunks in my nostrils. After this super violent purge I immediately felt better and asked my partners to go for a walk outside to the nearby park. They both agreed and since they were concerned for me after hearing and witnessing me run to the bathroom we quickly set off on our newest journey.     We then began to talk to each other fairly fluently about our stages in intoxication and personal anecdotes on the highs. A. said that the syrian rue definetly altered his mushroom high and that he felt higher then he normally was on mushrooms. B. was enjoying everything and had a giant smile that matched her pupils. Her most expressed thought was that everything seemed so liquid to her even though it also seemed like she was walking through the soup of life, meaning that the air was like a new never before revealed element that we had to move through and breach pathways.     We then walked through the park which contained caged animals for people to look at, turkeys, mini horses, llamas, peacocks, and rabbits. We tripped on these for a while wandering around happy and hallucinating but eventually decided that it was depressing and oppressive of us to try and enjoy another beings discomfort as a caged slave of entertainment. We then walked to the boardwalk with little gazeboes that border a shallow mud puddle of a pond. On the way I hugged a few trees thanked the air, tryed to meditate while walking so something else could lead my body to its direction, and had my brain float up into the air like I was sitting in a K hole. When we reached the gazebo we all tripped out to the shimmering of lights on the pond while raindrops rippled and ducks and swans swam across the reflected night sky. It was a moment of total awe as we pictured how we are all really floating upside down on the earth as the universe swirled under our feet.    We then smoked a bowl since I felt a little more nausea coming on. This didn\'t help at all as I progressively began to feel worse and worse. The same feeling as before was coming on but stronger and more intense. I didn\'t tell the other 2 since they were still having a good time enjoying the moment. My body then began to feel super weak as I couldn\'t feel my own pulse, I felt all the blood start to drain from my limbs and my brain  My body then began to feel super weak as I couldn\'t feel my own pulse, I felt all the blood start to drain from my limbs and my brain as my body went tingly my brain began to lose hold of my soul and all my energy crumbled around me and floated away. I felt like I was going to faint so I grabbed the bench right in front of me. I actually convinced myself that this was in fact how I was going to die just fall right over in front of my 2 friends out here in the cold, rainy, park at 5 in the morning. My vision was so intensely hallucinated that I felt I had started going blind and would never be able to see anything in focus again.     This is when I turned away from my friends on the bench, took 2 steps and began another set of insane puking. This time I felt as if pieces of my stomach were coming up in pure stomach bile mixed with some more little seed bits. My friends rushed over the moment they heard my contents hit the ground. They were terrified I was overdosing and about to die and asked me if I needed an ambulance. This actually brought a smile to my face for 2 seconds before I threw up again, here we are in the middle of a park at night that niether of my friends know, its freezing cold out (which we just noticed) and our extremities are all numb, were soaked from the rain we didn\'t notice, I cant move and we look like 3 crazy dilated lunatics and they\'re supposed to give directions to an ambulance? No I was able to pull through and with B.\'s hand on my back I felt warmer and felt my own spirit rejoin my body thanks to B.\'s healer powers I regained myself in body and mind and was brought back to life. I felt better once again and we started walking. Within 2 more minutes A., an experienced tripper, collapsed onto the ground leaning against a tree, not able to talk, only to slightly nod with his eyes closed. We once again worried he was O.D.ing  and went through the same paranoia. After working him out of it another 20 minutes later we all started back to my place frostbitten and tripping. We then changed clothes and lay down with blankets to sit without talking for another 3 hours till we all eventually dozed into dreamworlds that were not necessarily sleep.    In reflection that was one of the most intense nights of my life, by far the most nauseated of all my drug uses. The LSA was enjoyable at many times the thoughts and visuals were quite similar to LSD just not as trust worthy. The baby woodrose seeds that actually contained the LSA were not enjoyable at all, the sickness and dread and pains I could have definetly done without. I will never eat them again, or probably even do a LSA related seed/plant/whatever... I will never eat them again, or probably even do a LSA related seed/plant/whatever...     LSD is for me, this is not. B. greatly enjoyed her LSD and will do it again. She consistently said her trip was highly life affirming and positive except for the paranoia during our park excursion. If it hadn\'t been for I and A. reacting the way we did she wouldn\'t have had a single bad thought. A. said that he would never do syrian rue with mushrooms again he enjoys mushrooms more the way they are, especially without the motor control loss and the body collapsing.     It was one hell of a night that none of us will ever forget, <!--but I warn you if your going to try -->with baby woodrose I had some serious health issues as my body tried to ingest them. <!--I think I remember hearing something about a form of cyanide being related to the seeds coating and the way your body reacts to it. PREPARE YOUR OWN SEEDS!-->"
112125,Who Did I Become?,Elliottkae,"Aug 17, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Some time last summer my friend A suggested we try HBW as he had taken it a couple times before and enjoyed it immensely. I\'d had experience with acid, MD, coke, speed, weed and Es before, have always been open to new experiences and was still in my \'just arrived at college, let\'s get messed up!\' phase so was definitely game to try them. And I had one of the most glorious nights of my life.     We decided to chew 15 seeds each to start with, and then would try more at a later date. We scraped off the white coating from the outside and ate them 5 at a time, they tasted absolutely foul. Then we went and smoked a joint to mellow before the trip began. My pal A and our friend B played some video games and I chilled listening to music.     After about 40 minutes I started to get some very slight visual effects, the skirting around the ceiling seemed to thrum slightly, and there was a vague purple tinge to it. Eventually the tinge grew and became a sort of rushing stream of purple light coating the top of the wall. The song \'group autogenics one\' came on and we all lay down and began to relax. A sense of heaviness came over my body, then a deep, deep comfort wherever I lay, I covered myself in blankets to amplify this feeling. A warm sensation began in my stomach and I felt carefree and deeply happy. I could really feel each word of the song, and my body felt almost like it was pulsing in time to the music with jolts of happiness. It was quite wonderful.    I then stood up to use the bathroom and my god I felt light headed, but in the best way. Like I was almost floating away from my body, my sense of balance was appalling though. When I got back we talked and laughed for a while, smoked up for a bit all the while buzzing with a happy, comforted feeling. Visual effects increased over this time, things were quite blurry and the patterns that emerged seemed much more earthy and natural than those on LSD trips. I could make things seem bigger or smaller by just thinking about it, and my body was pulsing with every song that played. I could make things seem bigger or smaller by just thinking about it, and my body was pulsing with every song that played. Colours were amplified and new colours began to emerge as a sheen of light over objects in the room. Texture was dramatic and ever changing, the slightest light difference sending a shockwave through the patterns on the walls, almost dance like in their gracefullness. Then we decided we wanted some halloween sweets, and my friend B said A had to knock on the door to get them as a joke. <!--A mimed knocking on the door, and there was a shift. He became a different person very swiftly, he is a very good actor so slotted into the role of a young boy, while B pretended to be an old man frustrated with children bothering him. He told A to go away, but I intervened and said he could come inside the house, jokingly suggesting he could smoke up with us. B went mad at me for this suggestion, saying I was going mad and he cared about me and wanted to stop me from taking drugs. I slipped into character and began to laugh, saying B never cared for me and that I felt alone in the relationship. A returned after this, as the young boys father. He was a meth dealer who sent his children into houses to steal from the families, but had heard us talking about drugs and was offering to sell me some meth. I though long and hard about the offer while B started yelling again that it was a terrible decision. I began to cry, saying I felt helpless and that he didn\'t trust me anymore, which led me to sleeping with the neighbour. I cried for a while on him, telling him how sorry I was while he screamed, and then I screamed back about how isolating it was to not work because your husband wanted you to stay home and clean. B realised then he had also been doing something wrong, we talked through it with the help of A, once again a young boy who we promised to adopt to save him from his father. A then turned to us and said \'scene\' and we stopped being those other people instantly, like it had never happened. As the action went on I could see everything so clearly in my minds eye, almost to the point it was being projected on everything in front of me. -->    After this B and A went out to the chippy to get food for us and I decided to stay back and smoke for a while as I was still feeling light headed and was having heavy visuals by this point. After my smoke I closed my eyes and lay on the bed, and a complete euphoria and openness swept through me. I could see pink kaleadiscopes everywhere I looked with my eyes closed, and my arms and legs suddenly had no feeling, they weren\'t there any longer. I floated in comfort, feeling as if I was lighter than air and falling endlessly. My arms regrew and I had hundreds, I could feel every finger and limb clearly as wind rushed past it. I saw a bright light above me and below me there was darkness. I kept repeating the mantra \'this is the best thing you will ever experience\' under my breath, and could barely think of any words but those. I floated for an hour or so I believed, but it was actually only 20 minutes. The trip in total only lasted 4 hours until we fell asleep (after I ate food and got sick) but it felt like about a week in all honesty. I would check the clock what felt like every 10 minutes when it would only be 1 or even 30 seconds.     All in all, it was the best night of my life. And the fact I have experienced this leaves me eternally grateful."
52240,Crystallizing People and Spiral Staircase,Capella M.,"Aug 2, 2018",Amanitas - A. muscaria & H.B. Woodrose,"A couple of guys and I live together in what we like to call the \'House of Trial and Error\'. A few days prior, we finally recieved a much-anticipated package from the wonderful internet containing a large bag of Amanita Muscaria and a bag of 100 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. We got ready, hid all weapon-like implements, and invited our friend over.    At about midnight, one of the guys and I sat down and shelled the woodrose seeds. Each of us got eight-- two of the guys participating just ate theirs whole, chewing them well before swallowing, and the other one and myself ground ours into a fine powder and downed it mixed in water. We hurriedly got a digital voice recorder ready and waited it out.    Well, three hours later at 3:30a, we felt nothing except a light buzz in the head. Disappointed, we broke into the bag of amanita muscaria and each ate a rather large, 4-5g cap. The onset was quick.    Within half an hour we were on a hell of a ride. Went outside, had a cigarette, and talked about how our bodies were starting to feel a little funky. I noticed a kind of nauseating, warming tingle was starting to come over me and felt my stomach start to warn me of what it was going to do; so not long after we got back inside, I threw up for the first time that night, at about 4:15am.    It felt pretty terrible, but it was short and the whole experience was over within a few minutes. I washed up, brushed my teeth and rather than rejoining the others, I went into the bedroom and laid down by myself. It was really starting to hit me then.     I laid there and let the trip take over. I was getting pretty vivid closed-eye visuals of people and brilliant colors. Nothing when I opened my eyes when laying still, but when I fidgeted or shifted around the entire room seemed to shake and whirl. One of the guys was forcing himself to vomit; I could hear it, but the sound seemed to keep changing its distance from me. At times it sounded like he was far off, but at others I could have sworn he was right next to me. This prompted me to vomit again, at about 4:45a, for the last time that night. It was short yet again and I felt fine afterwards.    I went in the living room to check on the others. Our visiting friend planned to get in a frigid shower to shock his system into throwing up, and the conversation stayed pretty normal unless you count my quote that the audio picked up of: \'My stomach, like... spiraled around in triangle shapes and kept lifting until I threw up.\' \'My stomach, like... spiraled around in triangle shapes and kept lifting until I threw up.\' I realized at that point I was tripping a bit heavier than everyone else and returned to the bedroom.    A song started to play, and I was starting to get pretty realistic visuals, of large brown flowers to be exact whose petals opened and closed in beat with the song. I reached to pull the blankets over myself and realized they were made of paper! Due to a bit of memory loss at this point, I don\'t know what inspired what I said next:    \'Think hes finishing up, he is playing the drums too fast. Band is playing too fast against the thigh. He keeps coming out of the bathroom, or the bedroom, or just the other room, doing the gross thing with emulation... just, just to make me angry.\'    Then again, it seems I was just mindlessly muttering things into the recorder the entire night. I felt a bit tired, and super-comfortable on the bed underneath the \'paper blankets\', but the No-Doz we\'d taken earlier would keep me awake. By about 5am, I was seeing spiral staircases everywhere, endlessly twirling and sinking into the bed and floor. And even weirder, I started having hallucinations that the others were having hallucinations of me!    One of the guys ended up joining me on the bed, but I was still in my own world; I was \'facing the major nothingness\' which was probably brought on from my Buddhist meditations earlier in the day. \'That which is form is emptiness, that which is emptiness form\', a line from the Buddhist Heart Sutra, was running through my head to the point where I thought I was hearing it chanted aloud. I came to the conclusion that everything is nothing, and knew I was the not the only one that could \'see the castle\'.    The music faded into the background and felt like I was on my own. The guy laying next to me reported feeling like he was bouncing around the room, whilst I babbled something about seeing the new \'levels\' being formed every time I closed my eyes. He got up, and I started to freak out because he was crystallizing into square shapes. I started to yell at him, afraid he would turn into some giant crystal statue and he just stared at me, confused, but left the room anyway to change the music.    I left the room after a bit and found our friend sitting on the floor just inches from the TV screen, staring intently at the menu on a DVD we had in. I hadn\'t noticed the looping music from the DVD, because to me, it had perfectly fit in with the other music playing. I turned it off and we went on our last walk, which ended with me freaking out because \'the trees aren\'t moving with the sky\'.    When we went back, we didn\'t stay awake for much longer, settling into a restful, rather dreamless sleep. But the last thing my recorder caught was:    Me: God, goddammit. I would have taken that necklace and...     N: What?     Me: I saw somebody taking this crazy crown that one of us has on our heads and throwing a circle with it and finally putting it on in your circle and then vanishing. And its kind of evil, so Im like, oh great, theyll run around and do Goddess-knows-what with it.     N: Maybe hes not interested, maybe hell take off again. What were your intentions?     Me: No, theres really nothing, no one thing Im interested in. Im just seeing this guy and I dont know who he is. But hes off somewhere now, with that evil necklace.    Would I do it again? Yes. <!--Would I recommend it? Sure, but be smart about it... know yourself and be careful, and hide sharp objects, a valuable lesson taught to us by a classic film.-->"
74154,A Suprisingly Powerful Seed,SexyTime,"Jul 16, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Previous psychoactive experience: marijuana, alcohol, salvia, mushrooms, ecstasy, nitrous, nutmeg    I first tried Hawaiian Baby Woodrose as an attempt to try new psychoactive substances that are unscheduled, as to avoid any possible possession charges.  My first experience was very disappointing; the second was a mind blowing journey.  I ordered both sets of seeds from different online vendors; however I bought the second set of seeds from one of the many shaman extract sites that sell them.  They cost a little more that the first ones, but were well worth the extra money.   I took one Dramamine immediately before both attempts.         I used different preparation methods for each attempt.  The first time, I flamed and scraped off the outside husk (I read that it contains cyanide that makes you vomit), then crushed seeds as best I could using a pair of pliers.  Then I dropped the crushed seeds in about half a cup of hot distilled water, and waited for the water to return to room temperature before swallowing the whole mixture.  This attempt produced no noticeable effects, not even the nausea that most experiences describe.         The second time, I decided to throw caution to the wind and leave the seed husks fully intact.  I again crushed them with the pliers before putting them all in my mouth.  I chewed them up for as long as I could, and swallowed them once the taste became too vile.  I washed them down with normal bottled water.      I began feeling a little strange about 10 minutes after eating the crushed seeds.  The nausea didnt show up until about 40 minutes into the experience.  The nausea was nothing compared to some of the other experience I read about on Erowid.  My stomach felt a little upset, but nothing more than it would during a mild hangover and I was not even close to vomiting.  I believe that the Dramamine helped a lot to make this whole experience much more enjoyable.          After an hour, I started to feel extremely lethargic and weighed down.  I got into bed, and found that if I stared at the popcorn ceiling it would begin to shift to the left and right.  Then I discovered that I could connect the dots on the ceiling to create patterns and shapes.  I remember telling my roommate that I think I discovered how people came up with all those crazy constellations.  The music I was listening to became much more visual, as the ceiling shifted in rhythm with the songs.  I also noticed the gradual onset of a sort of body high, much like the beginning of a mushroom trip.  This occupied the first hour and a half of the experience.         From there I walked to the other room and watched about an hour of a rerun of the presidential debate.  Listening to them talk about the economy and other complex issues proved to be very stimulating, and I felt as if I fully understood every facet of the issues they discussed.  At that point I decided to take a look at my pupils and found that they had grown so that there was no color left in my eye.  I then returned to the comfort of my bed, and spend the rest of the trip staring out my window at the trees as they seemed to be entirely comprised of spirals of color.  The ceiling of my room was now a giant rotating spectrum of color, which would shift in three dimensions if I stared at one spot.           The body high that I described earlier had now transformed into something totally different.  It felt like taking a back massager or something and pressing it up against your head as vibrations coursed throughout my entire body.  In my brain I could hear the sound of an air chisel or some other pneumatic tool, which corresponded with the vibrations.    There were many moments of euphoria throughout the journey as I learned many of the secrets of the psychedelic world.  One thing I liked about the HBW seeds was that they gave me many of the visuals of a mushroom trip, without the deep introspective side of the experience.  There were moments of deep thought, but for the most part the whole journey was quite superficial.    I hope this account helps anyone considering delving into the world of LSA.<!--I would recommend Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds both for the experience, and for their cheapness and availability online.-->"
111120,Tripping in the Valley,yaboynatan,"Jun 17, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"<!--Hey guys. This is a trip report I wrote. It is a bit lengthy, so keep that in mind, but I recommend that everyone - beginners and more experienced trippers - read this report. I will attach a few images of my trip location, and my dilated pupils, in the comments.  Here are some details, before we begin:    Age: 18  Number of seeds: 10  -->Method of consumption: Seeds were ground up and put in a bottle of water. After completing this short process, I drank the mixture.  Setting: A village in Israel, in the countryside.  Start time of trip: Mixture was consumed at 6:30 PM. I started to feel the physical effects at 7:30 PM, and the mental effects at around 8- 8:30 PM.  Peak: 10:30 PM, approximately.  Comedown: 12:00 PM, midnight   Completely sober: 2:00 AM the next morning    Note: I\'ve only tripped twice before, both times with 7 seeds. There is a huge difference between 7 seeds and 10 seeds. Anyway, on to the trip report...    I went to my friend\'s village out in the countryside; I planned to take 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds there.  I arrived at his house and we played some video games and talked for a while. At about 6:30 PM, I crushed 10 seeds wrapped in a paper towel, with a hammer. I transferred the crushed up seeds into a bottle of tap water, and shook the bottle a few times. I quickly drank the mixture, fighting off mild nausea from the taste of the seeds. I took a sip of strawberry lemonade right after, to rid my mouth of the horrible taste.     I returned to my friend\'s room, and we hung out there for another 25 minutes. By about 7 PM, it was quite dark outside, so we decided to leave his house and go out into nature. He has a sort of valley near his house; near the highway. It wasn\'t an ideal setting, due to the lack of greenery in the location (Israel is very hot and dry, there isn\'t much grass). But there was a little man-made stream where we sat, which was quite peaceful.    My friend has also tripped twice on HBWR seeds. The first time, he took 7 seeds, fell asleep by accident, and had vivid dreams. The second time (again, with 7 seeds) was his last. He claimed that his trip had \'changed him\' and that he was a different person after tripping, so he didn\'t want to touch those seeds ever again. After attempting to convince him, I reluctantly gave up. He agreed to be my \'trip sitter\' and keep me company.    On the way to our tripping spot, my friend pulled out a vaporizer loaded with some sort of cannabis oil cartridge. He claimed it contained THC, but I had tried it in the past and felt nothing. He let me finish the rest of the oil in the cartridge, although I felt nothing except maybe a placebo effect. I threw the empty cartridge away.    We sat on the rocks by the man-made stream. I pulled out a cigar stub and lit it. At this time, I felt slight nausea and stomach pains, due to the natural toxins in the seeds. I chose a blues mix on YouTube, and sat back and thought about life while listening to the blues. When the cigar was finished; I threw it into the stream after taking one last puff.     At around 8:00, I started feeling the mental effects of the seeds. I began feeling depressed and physically uncomfortable. I thought about my future; things weren\'t going so well in school for me. I tried to lie down on the rocks, which helped slightly, although I was in an uncomfortable position. My friend was oblivious to my concerns about life as he scrolled through his Facebook feed. I shifted my position on the ground and tried to think positive thoughts. I told my friend to send some positive thoughts my way. He put on some uplifting music and we talked about the few pleasures in life. I don\'t remember much of what we talked about, but it seemed to cheer me up considerably.    Every 10 minutes or so, I felt the urge to urinate. On previous trips, I\'d experienced this as well Every 10 minutes or so, I felt the urge to urinate. On previous trips, I\'d experienced this as well<!--; apparently the body is trying to expel the toxins in the seeds through urination-->.  I really felt nauseous at this point, so I tried to make myself vomit. I stuck a finger down my throat, but couldn\'t bring myself to throw up. Eventually I gave up and sat back down next to my friend.    At 8:30, or even 9:00, the seeds started to kick in. I felt like I had to physically stand up and cover my face with my hands, for some reason. I couldn\'t stop talking to my friend. I discuss the issues of life with him often, but this time I really opened up. I talked to him about girls, school, personal issues, and my future. He was less sociable, but he also talked about his life a bit. I talked to him about my philosophical beliefs, and about the meaninglessness of life, and about nihilism. He told me something he\'d never told me before -- he had planned to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of a building. He started climbing the stairs to the roof, but when he got to the top, the door to the roof was locked.  I told him I thought about the act of suicide often, but that I\'d never actually do it, because I don\'t have the courage. He told me he didn\'t think about suicide much, but I suspected otherwise.    Now at this point, the time was around 10 PM. I was lying on the ground, digging my hands into the dirt, and picking up small rocks. I couldn\'t stop touching my face and head, and the muddy earth felt so refreshing. I couldn\'t stop smiling, for some reason. Every time I tried to display a normal facial expression, my lips curved up into a smile. I can\'t tell the reader exactly what happened between 10 PM and 11 PM, because I don\'t remember a thing. I just remember I was rambling about my thoughts on life and the universe.     Eventually at around 11 PM I decided that I was sober enough to return to my friend\'s house. We walked a bit, until my friend stopped at a dumpster at the side of the road. He said that people threw out perfectly good stuff on occasion, and he wanted to look through it. We found some old computer parts, brand new in the packaging. I couldn\'t focus on the goods, due to my state of mind. We decided to leave the parts and come back tomorrow to take them.    We arrived at his house at approximately 11:30 PM. His mother and sister were sleeping on the two couches in the living room, so my friend woke them up. I was not that hungry, but I felt like I needed to eat something. My friend gave me a piece of chicken and some fried potatoes, but I could barely eat because my mouth was completely dry. I gulped down water. I was still smiling uncontrollably. I gulped down water. I was still smiling uncontrollably. I went to the bathroom to urinate again. I looked at myself in the mirror. My pupils were huge. I felt a bit nauseous, but couldn\'t vomit. My friend suggested that I brush my teeth, but I had forgotten my toothbrush at home. So I put some toothpaste on my finger and ran it over my teeth, then washed my mouth out with water.     I was extremely tired at this point.  I lay down on a couch in the living room. As I closed my eyes, strange geometric patterns and futuristic visions appeared. Swirling shapes and colors appeared on a backdrop of tiny pastel-colored squares and other similar shapes. My friend turned the TV on to an episode of \'Workaholics.\' I watched the episode, but the movements and actions of the characters on screen felt foreign and awkward. I really wanted to sleep, but my friend insisted on one more episode. I just lay back and enjoyed the geometric visions. My body felt relaxed and calm. I couldn\'t stop touching my mouth, and running my tongue over my lips. I continued to smile uncontrollably.  At 12:00 PM, my friend turned out the lights.    I drifted into a restless sleep. I woke up at 1:00 AM with a mouth as dry as the desert. I went to the sink and filled a water bottle, and drank. I ran to the bathroom to urinate again. My pupils were less dilated, but still quite large. I was still tripping. I went back to bed, but I couldn\'t sleep. \'What if I never snap out of this trip?\' I thought to myself. \'Could I live a normal life with this altered mindset?\' My heart was racing and I felt very hot and sweaty. I tried to sleep, but I grabbed my phone and searched \'what if I never stop tripping\' and \'does an acid trip always end.\' I wasn\'t satisfied with the results, and I fell into a troubled sleep.    At 3:00 AM, I woke up again. I was back to normal. I felt very relieved. I drank some more water and went to the bathroom again. My pupils were not dilated. I needed to vomit but I successfully managed to hold it in. I went back to bed, but I couldn\'t sleep. I kept replaying the events of the night in my head. This drug was nothing to take lightly.   At 6:30 AM, I woke up, drank some water, and went back to bed.    That was my experience with 10 seeds. I never thought that such a small amount of seeds could produce a stunningly powerful psychedelic experience.<!-- I recommend that everyone read this report so they can know my experience. Thank you all. I hope you enjoyed reading this. --> I don\'t think I will ever do LSA again, but maybe someday..."
110938,A Euphoric Surprise,Rob,"Jun 17, 2018",H. B. Woodrose,"My only drug experiences before this were caffeine and weed edibles twice, though one of them caused no noticeable effects. I had received these seeds about three weeks before, after doing a fair amount of research online. For about a year before I had a great interest in psychedelics, so I dove into the experience positively, and without much anxiety. I knew my dose was on the large side, but I felt I needed to quench my curiosity and take that much. I did them at my girlfriend\'s house. I\'ll call her Kate, and we were together for about two years at that point.     2:00  I put the seeds in my mouth, and was met with a bland dirty taste as the shell touched my tongue. I tried to bite down, but realized they were too hard and had to soak for a bit. I bit down after a minute, and was met with an awful taste. Like onion, garlic, and jalapeno Chex Mix had been blended together and left in the sun to fester for a week. I realized I couldn\'t keep them in my mouth to absorb the LSA sublingually, so I swallowed them and washed it down with milk. I expected to vomit and milk always makes it hurt less.     2:30  I start feeling a a surprisingly comfortable coldness through my body, that I\'ve felt every time I\'ve done these seeds since. I start feeling a a surprisingly comfortable coldness through my body, that I\'ve felt every time I\'ve done these seeds since. It\'s hard to explain and I don\'t see it talked about much, but it\'s almost like how my chest feels when I go into a cool swimming pool. Kate had a small amount of a pot brownie before I arrived, and she was obviously high at this point. I laughed at her laughing and grinning and it made me feel better about what I saw going to experience.     3:00  I feel a heavy feeling slowing me down, as my thoughts began feeling different and my brain becomes confused. I start feeling nauseous, but it\'s gone in five minutes. I explain to Kate how I feel, and she asks me a few questions to keep me thinking.    3:15  We put on some music, a band that I had discovered about 2 weeks prior called Liquid Sound Company. I had listened to one of their albums twice, but none of the other two. As it begins playing I can feel my thoughts speeding up as I begin to peak towards the end of it. As the music was playing, I felt as though my head became a landscape. A large sunny and orange desert, with a sort of temple nearby. The music was very desert sounding, and the large bare light on the ceiling made me think strongly of the sun. An interesting effect was how I percieved the music. One thing I noticed beforehand was that the music, though beautiful, didn\'t convey and emotion too strongly to me. When I heard it while tripping, it was almost as though I could see through a sort of cover and each song was filled with joy and bright feelings. An unfamiliar album by the same artist came on, and this desertscape in my mind became a little more detailed as I felt more connected with the world around me. I was confused because some songs sounded exactly the same as the last ones. I found out later that many of the tracks were the same, which explains a lot.    4:00  I felt like this drug was explaining to me how other psychedelics would affect me, and what a bad trip and a good trip were. It explained to me that a bad trip is absolute horror, and that if I listened to it things would go pretty smooth. In my brain I saw a timeline that went from LSA, to LSD, then mushrooms. There were substances past that but they were foggy and unclear.     4:30  I felt more nauseous than I ever have in my life. If I moved a fingertip I felt like I was gonna vomit. If I moved a fingertip I felt like I was gonna vomit. Kate had to stay five feet away because even her clean smell of her shampooed hair made me feel worse. Any smell or touch multiplied what my stomach was feeling.     4:45  I was laying there nauseous, trying not to focus on anything. I knew I was gonna vomit at one point, and within two seconds I was. Most of it went into a trash can, luckily. I heard that once you puke, the nausea goes away. That was not the case. I kept vomiting because the smell of the seeds and the sandwich I ate earlier were coming from the trash can. I was crying and puking and felt overall awful. Luckily it wasn\'t painful, I\'m so glad that I had milk. It was not what I had seen earlier in my mind that was a bad trip. We got food for later, but surprisingly Kate wasn\'t hungry so everything stayed downstairs. I could smell beans and onion and it made me puke more, but Kate swore it didn\'t smell like that and that I was hallucinating. I got caught in this thought loop of \'You\'re not gonna vomit.... Never mind\', and she asked me if I was okay once in a while and I nodded my head yes.    10:45  I haven\'t looked at a clock since maybe 3. Kate tells me what time it is, and I start laughing as she says 10:45. It feels like an hour at most. The biggest mindfuck I\'ve experienced in my life was this. I felt like time had been slowed down through the whole thought loop part, but 10:45? What the hell. I stand up, and my nausea is mostly gone. I rinse my mouth with milk to get the awful taste of puke out of it, and Kate comes back into the room a few minutes later with microwaved Mexican fast food. I take one bite of my burrito, and it tastes exactly like what I smelled earlier when the food was downstairs. We chat a little bit and go to sleep at maybe 3.     This was a great start for me into the world of psychedelics. I learned what good and bad trips meant and I knew to take the advice I was given while I was on these seeds."

To do this I crushed 4 seeds and boiled them in a cup of water for 3 minutes.  Then I let it cool for ten minutes and drank the green looking tea.  I didn\'t eat the seed mush.

111738,I Felt Like I Exploded,kinny,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"First Real Psychedelic Experience    So before I explain this trip Ill explain a little bit about my situation. At the time of taking them, I was 16, I had experiences with cannabis, alcohol, coffee of course. All the usuals for someone my age. A year prior, I had a very small dose of mushrooms (not sure which ones, probably psilocybe cubensis) and didnt have much effect. Anyway, this trip has been life-changing, and Ill try my best to explain it.     I ordered a pack of 25 seeds and tried them with 2 friends. I was very eager to try them and so, stupidly I took my first one in town, along with said friends. The times are approximate as its reality started to change as soon as I took them, but ill try my best.      6.30pm: We all take 1 seed each, chewing them for about 10-15 mins and swallowing it. One friend, Ill call her S, said they tasted like popcorn kernels, of course, they werent salty, but I thought that was pretty accurate.     7.00pm: Physically, we all felt slight vasoconstriction very slight nausea, similar to being drunk without the dizziness. Mentally, we were buzzed, like after having two energy drinks. We were feeling really happy and talkative, without any psychedelic effects.     8.00pm: Were at home now, and we dont think much of the seeds, so we pop one more in each and listen to some music. Not as buzzed now, but definitely feeling discomfort. My friend, M, feels like throwing up and decides not to take any more.     8.00pm: S gets a call and has to go home, so we both pop two more and my mom drives her back. On the drive, I start feeling the effects really kick in. The sky is a vibrant dark blue and the headlights of cars make laser shows in my eyes. I feel very similar to having a strong bong hit with weed, slight disconnection and reality seems to be coming in waves, rather than linearly.    8.30pm: I\'m sitting in my room watching trip videos with M, and he feels so discomforted that he decides to go up to bed. Then for some strange reason, I become completely incapable of swallowing. My muscles in my throat just dont obey my brain. I think nothing of it and go make some ginger tea, which helped a lot with the nausea.     9.00pm: The kitchen starts to breath so I decide now would be a good time to go to bed, I got up and lie down and decide not to sleep for a while, to get the full effect.       The rest of the trip is difficult to recall and my perception of time is pretty eradicated.     ?? 10.00pm The walls are breathing and the pattern on the wooden floor is changing, like its water without reflections. I start to freak out a little because my thoughts stop forming the way they normally do, but I calm down with a code word I would repeat to myself the whole night: Oh my god.    Midnight: I check my watch and realize that Ive been staring at the floor for probably two hours. I\'m exhausted but I cant close my eyes to sleep because the CEVs are too much to handle.    The knots of the door are spinning and scattering across the room like ants, and I mustve watched them move for 7 hours because I check my phone and it\'s suddenly 7am. Craziest thing that\'s ever happened to me, it was amazing.     At some point in the trip, I close my eyes and I see myself from a third perspective, but Im not on my bed, Im naked floating on water in the middle of the ocean. I could feel with water underneath me vividly and the wetness of my hair. Then I experience something impossible to explain. My entire body, my consciousness, all explodes into thousands of pieces and there\'s nothing for a while. I just float on that water, with heat and comfort. This freaks me out and I open my eyes and breath deeply. It felt like either 2 hours of floating or 2 seconds, and I try to calm myself down. I look at my hands but theyre bright blue and I freak out more. At this point I want it to end, even though, looking back on it now, I would love to have that feeling again.     The next day: I meet up with S, she tells me she threw up and didnt get much effect other than giddiness. M felt like his thoughts were in a bubble that he couldnt pop, and I felt like I exploded.     Overall, it was amazing, I was terrified for some parts of the trip that when I exploded, I wouldnt be able to come back together, but I did and it was fine. The bodily discomfort bed-locked me, probably for my own safety.<!--but I would advise preparing it properly to avoid that. --> Apologies if this report is too long for such a mundane trip, but this is my first writing like this.<!--to erowid, and I havent gotten the hang of it yet. Anyway, safe tripping mdoods.-->"
41705,Meeting With the Spirit,bluegreen,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"First of excuse my english....I speak rather french.    A little anxious, I let soak three seeds crushed of A. nervosa in a little vodka during five hours. In the late afternoon, I drank the surnageant on a empty stomach... Fortunately, I took only 3 seeds because what followed is beyond any description.     The plant nicely took me by the hand and with lot of softness brought the answers to me to all my existential questions. I left to walk in surrounding nature, sat down in a field under a splendid sky with a beautifull sunset... and I can resume what followed by only one word...extase.....    pure extase in front of the incredible beauty of a thing what we do never see but what is however beside us... The universe, our world, in a calm and a indescribable silence. The mask fell... finally.    I realized at what point my friends were important for me for the joy and the laughter that we share together. I saw them ravelling in front of me with a superb clearness. I saw each one of them with their particular characteristics, their concern, their qualities, their defects and I understood instantaneousely how to help them on their path of life...     The night came and I returned to the house surprised by the quality of what happened to me... the spirit touch my poor person and clarified me with a soft and warm interior light...    Lastly, I returned at home purified, after years on the road. I lit candles and incense, put soft music until the early morning in one atmosphere of peace and meditation as I had\'nt known from a long time ago. There will be a before and  an after...     I am in deep veneration in front of the power of these plants and I will be always infinitely grateful for what they brought to me. They deserve our respect and they should not be taken with lightness... In the morning I went to see my ipomaea violacea flourishing, and each blue flower seemed to laugh at the good joke that their tropical cousin had played to me... I will not do it again before a long time but from now, I know that I have an ally soft and quiet but incredibly powerful."
86778,Nausea and Fainting,Anonymous,"May 10, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I consumed 20 seeds on an empty stomach at 6am last morning; I had previously tried lower doses, with no effects other than nausea. I was feeling in perfect condition, albeit a little tired after waking up at 6pm the previous day.    For the next hour, I felt next to no effects. After that, I started watching a movie, which lasted about an hour and a half. At the end of the movie, I was feeling slightly nauseous, but nothing more (apart from dilated pupils).    The nausea kept getting worse, so I decided I needed to lie down and rest on my bed. The nausea kept worsening, but no other effects kicked in. I started sweating and feeling feverish, and a bit delirious. No hallucinations, but had trouble concentrating and my mind tended to fixate on various things around the room, especially writings.    After staying in my bed for about two hours, I started feeling really sick. I decided I needed to get up to vomit. I got up and went next to the sink, but suddenly felt really weak, fainted and fell upon the floor. I instantly regained consciousness and felt a lot better already, relieved of nausea and just generally comfortable; I stayed in this position for about half an hour, before going back to bed, where I managed to doze off for a bit.    At about noon, I was awake and feeling nauseous and feverish, but still very weak. I also really needed to go to the toilet, so I got up but ended up fainting again, same as before. I laid on the floor for a bit longer, and went back to bed again, managing to sleep.    I ended up waking up again at about 6pm, still feeling nauseous and weak, but all the other effects had worn off (including dilated pupils). After about three more hours, I started feeling better again; I went to the toilets and then went to get a bite to eat and drink and regained strength.    All in all a very unpleasant experience. I think the worst was laying in bed, feeling nauseous and extremely weak, knowing that if I got up I\'d just collapse onto the ground. The lack of any hallucinations was probably due to tolerance building up, as I had consumed 10 seeds two days before that with little to no effect except nausea and pupil dilation."
52919,Ordeal With Five Seeds,Lauren,"Apr 4, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Took 5 seeds at around 10:20pm after fasting for about 6 1/2 hours. Within 5 minutes experienced painful stomach cramps and 15 min later vomited several times and felt slightly better.     I\'d read that after being sick the good part of the trip should come on but this was not to be. Had depressing insights into my negative behaviour and personal relationships but found it difficult to keep a thought in my head or string a sentence together and was feeling exhausted with sore stomach. At about 11:15pm vomited again, in a lot of pain, more dry retching after everything in my stomach was gone. Went to lie down again but although very strained and tired could not sleep. Muscles clenching in legs, buttocks and shoulders resulting in cramps. Difficulty moving (getting up or walking) or rather difficulty willing body to move, almost like paralysis, as if I couldn\'t contact my motor cortex and tell it to listen to me. Lots of shaking and twitching, mild convulsions. Felt very poisoned and sick. Then a short respite with period of giggles and calmness but nausea and cramps returned soon. Managed to get to the kitchen after trying to get there for like half an hour or more and ate a bit of apple and dried fruit to see if the food would perhaps absorb/decrease the effects of the seeds but didn\'t really help. Now followed absolutely agonizing hours of intense stomach and muscle cramps, nausea and shaking.     I felt seriously ill and thought that perhaps I had been fatally poisoned. Couldn\'t sleep till 4am. Awoke 3 hours later utterly exhausted. Don\'t recall dreaming. Phew. Man, that was an ordeal. Not again."
10642,Ho Hum,Sudo Nim,"Mar 16, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"After reading about these seeds I mail ordered 20 of them on-line and decided to eat 10 of them the afternoon of my final class.  After scraping the fuzzy stuff with a razor blade (making sure surface of seed is shiny and not dull), I put them under a dry measure cup and put my full weight on them and crushed them up.  I put them in my mouth along with a couple of Dramamine tablets and waited.    [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    It took a while for anything to really begin.  I felt really nervous for a while but I bet it took a solid hour to really notice anything.  I went outside for a smoke and noticed some cool effects.  Since my pupils were so dialated it seemed like I had super vision.  Every little detail was extremely clear (leaves, animals, etc.).  I started having some strange \'mind bursts.\'  It sort of felt like when I just fall asleep sitting up (think of the head nod), and suddenly I just wake up and I am disoriented.  It was sort of cool at first but it got a little annoying.  They went away after a while.  I started getting very giddy and felt very happy, although a little lethargic.  I only had menthols, so a grabbed my keys and headed for the store.  I guess I hadn\'t spoken for awhile, cause when I asked the clerk for smokes it sounded NOTHING like my voice.  It wasn\'t scary, but it freaked the shit out of me.  That was weird.  I found the effect so cool that I started constantly muttering to myself.  Bet that looked good.    I went back, did some other stuff for a while.  At this point, I was feeling more drunk then ~psychedelic~.  I decided to go get food so off again.  Driving wasn\'t hard, but my reflexes were super slowed down.  I corrected for this by driving exactly the speed limit and driving by the book.  Wasn\'t hard.  I went to McDonalds.  Food smelled wonderful.  I ordered a bunch paid and took a moment to breath in the delicious aromas.  I grabbed a Big Mac bit in and...nothing.  The burger had no flavor.  It tasted like cloth or something just really bland.  That sucked, but I kept trying to much a little here and there.  The coke I got was a god send.  When I got back I was feeling really drunk and it was reinforced with the need to piss every 10 minutes.  Peeing was getting to be a real chore cause I was exhausted.  It had probably been about 6 hours since I had taken the seeds.  I decided to watch a movie and it turned out to be really cool.  The movie seemed to be very important and beautiful and I really got into it.  At the end I just sat staring at the tv and sort of just glowing.  Moving had ceased to feel good about 4 hours ago so I just stopped doing it.  Had to move to piss and smoke every once in a while.  When I tried to go to sleep that night it was impossible.  It sort of felt like growing pains:  where no position is comfortable and you just can\'t get to sleep.  It wasn\'t fun at all.  I was exhausted and just wanted to end this experience.  Finally I fell asleep.  I woke up feeling a little groggy, but contented, and started my day with no problems.    I tried the seeds once again in a lower dose (6) and it felt like being tranquilized.  I didn\'t move for hours and I was in a trance and can\'t remember much of it.  <!--Wouldn\'t recommend anything less than 8.  -->These seeds just aren\'t that great.  Figures.  They definitely get me high, but it\'s an uncomfortable high and it lasts too long and drains me too much.  Sleeping was very unpleasant.  <!--If you do do these do not plan on going anywhere where you will be forced to move or be physically active.  You just won\'t want to.  --> I like to wear something warm too, because it gets a little chilly at the begining.  HBRW seems a lot like booze but better because I\'m not hot I\'m cool, my mind isn\'t cloudy it\'s elucid, it ends with uncomfortability instead of hours dry heaving into the toilet, and I don\'t wake up with a deathwish from a hangover.  However, they\'re nothing spectacular.  There\'s a lot of chemicals in the world that will fuck me up if you ingest them.  Why should I not stick to the ones that are a little more tried and true?"
111072,Emotional Disturbances,A-braxas,"Oct 14, 2017",Huasca Combo (B. caapi & A. peregrina) & H.B. Woodrose,"I am a boy from Colombia, who has enjoyed good times alone under the effect of psychedelics, but I also have a life to sustain, tragically both have been intermixed and live in the disturbance.    4:00 pm: - I start peeling the trunk of banisteripsis caapi, I have gotten two different varieties of putumayo, cielohuasca and tigrehuasca. I start to bake them until they lint them in my mouth and absorb their juices and pass straight without locking caapi, apparently one variety is sweeter than the other but their trunks are very hard but not impossible to undo in my mouth.    5:00 pm: I begin to feel the characteristic purge with the banisteriopsis varieties. I feel the characteristic mental agitation of inhibiting monoamine oxidase.  \xa0  5:30 pm: I have in my freezer some pre-prepared seeds of Argyreia nervosa and I start to thaw, meanwhile I take and prepare ginger water and buy some guava candy.    5:45 pm: - I swallow and chew the seeds with the mouth previously washed and chew the seeds and keep in my mouth for a few minutes to ensure the correct absorption of the compounds. At the same time diluted adenanthera peregrina powder previously prepared in ginger juice and take a big sip, its taste is delicious.    6:10 pm: I begin to feel the characteristic nausea of &#8203;&#8203;the mixture in my body so I put some music of prolonged duration to go passing the effects. I notice an unpleasant smell in me and I am going to bathe. Any movement, it is tragically painful in my legs because of the vasoconstricting effect of the substances, this is where I wonder if I did something wrong, the bath was simply incredible.    6:30 pm: (+) My pupils have dilated and the nausea has increased, the feelings of euphoria are incredible, feel a night too cool so to slow the nausea I start to eat some sweet guava, actually better than the ginger and that lemon. My stomach has recovered but not in full.    7:00 pm: I close my eyes and see too many feathers of peacocks, look all directions and none and my heart, a dramatic leap in such a short time. I start to think of the last things that have happened to me, and my tears start to come out of my eyes, it feels so fresh and so relieved.  \xa0  8:00 pm: (++): the load of the mixture is simply too strong, what I do is simply useless, I feel impotence I feel that I am a sea sand or a drop between an ocean, it is a feeling too beautiful.    9:00 pm: I go out to walk my dog &#8203;&#8203;and I notice that the movements are too mechanical so I only give him a short walk where I realize that the cars, people and the environment is too normal and my mental and physical load does not help, I\'m just used to grin and I\'m not.\xa0I close my eyes and see how the birds open their wings and want to make me fly in thoughts, comes to my mind so many memories and I can only see in them that I have lived to the maximum, maybe I am too sensitive.    10:00 pm: I try to go to sleep, after a shake and some conversations I prepare a chocolate a sandwich not to go to bed with empty stomach. When closing my eyes I see as many neon color symbols as I can.  I finally managed to sleep.    The following morning I was treated with headache, perhaps as a contradiction of monoamine oxidase inhibitors.    Current state: Stable, without mental or emotional upheaval, I am personally happy to have left my addiction to cigarette, cocaine, and methamphetamine."
109585,The Orange Juice Cycles,ThePoobaman_,"Aug 14, 2017",H.B. Woodrose,"Me and a best friend/lover, R, took some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds one day over spring break at our dorm. Very few other people were still on campus, so we decided to take advantage of our privacy and take a fairly strong dose. I took 10 seeds, she took 8. We fasted for 12 hours before eating the seeds and cleaned up her dorm room (where we spent most of the trip). We did not peel the shells or do any sort of extraction.  I am writing this a few days after the trip, so Ill try to summarize the events.     T - 0:15   We begin chewing the seeds. R finds the flavor earthy and nauseating. I dont taste much, perhaps a faint flavor of peanut.     T+ 0:00   We finish chewing up the seeds and wash them down with some water. Overall, Id say it took about 15 minutes for us to finish them. They werent that hard to get down.    T + 0:20  I have prepared a spliff to smoke, R is starting to feel a bit nauseous (she said her nausea began immediately after finishing chewing the seeds). I ask her if she wants to hit the spliff, but she refuses, out of worries that the smoke will only make her more nauseous. We decide to wait to go out and smoke a little bit longer.    T + 0:45   We are lying in a field a few blocks off campus, smoking in the sunlight. I begin to feel very sedated and sleepy, and Rs nausea gets much worse (she will not stand up because she fears she will vomit). I finish the spliff and dont feel very stoned at all, but I am definitely getting very mild OEVs (lots of tracers) and the sedation is getting stronger by the minute. R also feels very sleepy.    T + 0:55   We sit in the field for quite a while. R closes her eyes, still feeling sick. We lie on one another and cuddle in the warm sun. I am feeling an upset stomach too, but I have never thrown up on a psychedelic before, and I tell myself Im not going to let it happen today. I instead choose to watch a swarm of insects fly around a tree, watching them draw tracers by flying around a tree branch.     T + 1:00   We definitely picked a day that was too hot to go outside on, at least on drugs. It was maybe only as hot as 80 degrees (Fahrenheit). I am very tired and want to go lie on Rs bed, so I tell her I am leaving. She doesnt want to leave, so I agree to stay with her for a little while.    T +1:10   I get bored and head back anyway, telling her I need to go inside. As I walk, I realize how high I am. The visuals are still mild, but the sedation is really intense. I can barely walk. I decide to sit down under the shade of some trees. Im less than a block away from campus, but I simply cant make it back in one trip.     T + 1:20   I think I may have fallen asleep briefly beneath the trees. I realize R is probably in a similar state as me, if not worse. I decide I need to go rescue her from the field.     T + 1:25   It turns out R had the same idea. I run into her on the way back to the field; she is walking back to campus. I ask if she wants to lie down in the shade I had been resting in. She agrees. Her nausea is worse than ever, she says.    T + 1:30   R vomits multiple times as a suburban mom walking her dog goes by. I am thoroughly amused. R is not. Fortunately, because we fasted beforehand, she just vomited up a little bit of water and some of the seeds followed by a few dry heaves.    T + 1:40   We rest for a bit and make it back to campus. Rs bed is extremely comfortable, but her room is swelteringly hot and awful. We lie sprawled out on blankets on her floor, the door flung open and the window as wide as it will go (there is no AC yet in the dorms) in a desperate attempt to cool off the room.    T + 2:00   I begin to nod off and fall into a dreamy half-sleep for a while. I dont feel very nauseous any more, just extremely tired and (pleasantly) sedated. It feels somewhat like an opiate.    T + 3:00   I am slightly disoriented and awaken very suddenly with a great surge of energy. R is asleep. I mumble something about buying orange juice and grab some quarters and dollar coins (which I dont think the vending machine accepts\x85) to go to a vending machine on the first floor of our dorm. I am immediately hit by an immense wave of sedation and crawl onto the bed and fall into the dreamy half-sleep for a bit.     A cycle establishes itself at this point. Heres how it went:  I awaken with a big rush of energy, thirsty and craving orange juice  I count out my coins and tell R I am going to go buy orange juice. Depending on her level of awareness/consciousness, she either responds with a weak affirmation and expresses desire for some of the orange juice or doesnt respond.  I stumble around as another wave of sedation hits me, confused and moving around furniture.   I crawl into the bed or onto the floor and fall into the half-sleep until the pattern repeats again.    This cycle went on periodically for about two hours, with 30-45 minutes between each cycle. It happened 3 or 4 times, I dont remember exactly. R remembers it happening at least twice, but she was asleep for at least one of the cycles.     T + 5:00  I awaken, this time permanently. Believing I am trapped in the cycle and will never escape, I ask R to get me the orange juice. I reason that she has vomited up the seeds and is probably sober enough to handle going downstairs, or is at least more sober than I am. She seems more lucid than I am, and she goes downstairs.    T+ 5:05  I feel extremely euphoric and happy looking at the waning sunlight out of the dorm window. I am glad I am awake enough to finally enjoy the drug. The ceiling is melting and morphing the same way it does on LSD, but with a bit less intensity. I dont know if this was a result of the dose or if LSA/HBWR seeds are simply less visual than LSD.     T + 5:10  The door is open. I hear R coming toward the room, then a heaving noise and a splash. This is quickly followed by a moan and a second heaving noise and a splash. I drag myself out of bed and help her into the room, avoiding the pools of vomit in the hallway. She does not have any orange juice. She said she went downstairs, discovered the vending machine didnt accept 5$ bills, and felt sick. She went up the elevator, but the upward motion made her stomach feel even worse. She couldnt hold it in long enough to make it to the bathroom and thus threw up in the hallway.    T + 5:15  I offer to help R clean up, but she declines. While she cleans, I sit and enjoy myself, again watching the sunlight outside the window. I feel very happy in spite of the relatively bad trip. Visuals remain mild but present. This was probably the best part of the trip.    T + 6:00   I can feel the waves of sedation getting weaker. R is recovered and no longer nauseous at all. We both drink some water and get ready to go buy groceries.    T + 7:30   Going to the grocery store was horrible. It felt like a monument to sick hyperconsumerism, with brightly colored brands screaming from the shelves to buy, buy, BUY! R felt the same way. I also got confused while trying to check out; the elderly clerk paused for about 15 seconds to take a break and simply sat there, staring off into the distance. I was completely thrown off by this and embarrassingly started scanning my own items, figuring that was the way it was done. He growled that this was not self-checkout to me and started scanning the items himself. My face got red with shame and I apologized profusely and we left the store as quickly as possible. The effects of the drug were more or less worn off, but there were slight lingering psychological effects that made the embarrassment and anxiety much worse than it would have been sober.    T + 8:30   We cook dinner and go out to smoke a few bowls of good weed before eating. Dinner was delicious. I went to bed a few hours later with no problem. I woke up the next morning completely sober and with no after effects.     Retrospect:   Despite the fact that I was only coherent/awake for 25% of the trip, I think it was a worthwhile experience with a few minor (but still profound) realizations about life.  The realizations were not worth the nausea and sedation (the sedation was really quite uncomfortable until about 5 hours in)."
89419,I Felt Extremely Sick,Allison,"Mar 29, 2017",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"One of the Worst Experiences of My Life    In June of 2010, my parents moved to Arizona, and my brother and I went with them to help them move. My parents friends also live there with their son, who was familiar with the area. He suggested that we go to an area of town that is a popular hang-out for college students. This guy, who Ill call Max, is really big into drugs. He was really excited to show us this store which carries legal substances with all kinds of different effects. We talked about it beforehand, and we went into the store planning to buy some pills that were supposed to have similar effects to ecstasy. However, the guy who worked at the store instead suggested that we buy Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. He described them as being very similar to LSD, which I had not tried at the time, but I have tried it since then, and I can say that, at least for me, they are definitely nothing alike. We bought two packs which contained 10 seeds each, and planned on splitting them.    The next day, we told our parents that we wanted to go hang out with Max at his house, knowing that his family would be gone the whole day. We got there around 1:00 in the afternoon and ate the seeds shortly after. I had looked up some information on the internet about how to consume the seeds, so I attempted to peel off the outer layer of skin like most website suggested. All three of us did this, but we didnt do anything else besides chew them up and swallow them. I ate 6 seeds, Max ate 8 seeds, and my brother ate 4 seeds. After we ate them, we went outside and planned on swimming, but we were only outside for about half an hour because we all started to feel sick and dizzy from the combination of the heat and the seeds.     Nothing else really happened for about an hour, and we were all about to give up on the seeds. After an hour though, we all started to feel different. Im not really sure how to describe it, but I definitely felt dizzy and uneasy. I found it hard to talk properly or form coherent sentences. I also felt goofy, kind of like I was high or something. I also giggled a lot. I started to roll around on the floor and rub my hands on the carpet and repeatedly stretch out the muscles in my arms and legs. Maxs mom ended up coming home around 5:00, and she offered us some Teddy Grahams and something to drink. It was incredibly hard to chew the Teddy Grahams. I felt like my mouth didnt work. The drink didnt taste good at all either.     At this point I was feeling very uneasy and I wanted the trip to end. I didnt feel like myself at all, and I was getting worried because we were supposed to be going out to eat with my family that night, and I was sure that they would notice something was wrong with all of us. I went in the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror, and my pupils were bigger than I had ever seen them, which kind of freaked me out. During all this time, my brother and Max were experiencing somewhat similar things as me, but they both said they found it much more pleasurable than I ever did.    My parents showed up and started talking to me a little bit, but I barely remember what anybody said. I wasnt even sure if they could understand me, because I still felt like I couldnt speak properly. I still felt like I couldnt speak properly. Up until this point, I hadnt really gotten up and moved around at all. I had been sitting on the floor for about three hours. When we got up to leave and go to the restaurant, I could tell walking to the car that I was very dizzy and lightheaded. When I sat down in the car, I felt like it had taken a lot of energy just to get inside of it. It got worse when we actually got to the restaurant. After walking into the restaurant, I felt like I was going to pass out. My brother told me I looked really sick, which was the truth. I barely made it to the table without fainting, and as soon as I sat down, I almost instantly threw up all over the table. Luckily, I was able to keep it down, but I felt extremely sick. My mom said my face was as white as a ghost. She was freaking out because she didnt know what was wrong with me, but I didnt even have the energy to speak. I had to lie down in the booth in order to keep myself from puking. My brother was making crazy faces at me and freaking out because he thought I was tripping out and was afraid it was going to happen to him too at any minute.     Luckily, Maxs mom is a nurse, and she offered up an explanation without me even having to give one. I am notorious for not drinking very much water, so she said that I had probably gotten heat stroke from being out by the pool all day (which is what we told her we did all day). That seemed to satisfy my mom, but she was still really worried. I kept trying to secretly talk to my brother, but she kept asking what I was saying. I contemplated telling them that I had eaten the seeds, because I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital since I was feeling so incredibly awful. I wasnt able to sit up throughout the entire meal.    My brother told me that he also felt sick for a few minutes, but then it went away. Max continually chewed on his lip ring, so much that he was chewing his lip raw. My brother kept pulling at his gauges and clicking his teeth. Neither of them could even eat the food they ordered because they couldnt use forks and the food kept falling out of their mouths. They told my parents that they had eaten too many Teddy Grahams at Maxs house.     Finally, we were able to leave the restaurant, but I still felt like crap. We had to stop at a store to get some things, but I opted to stay in the car. However, my parents were taking a really long time, and I had to pee pretty badly. I decided to get out and go in, but it was a bad decision. By the time I actually made it to the bathroom, I felt like I had just run a marathon. The intense brightness of the store and all of the noise also made me feel sick. When I got back to the car, I felt dizzy and nauseous again.    We got home around 9:30, and I went to bed right away. My parents didnt understand why heat stroke was affecting me so badly. However, even though I wanted to sleep more than anything, and I felt absolutely exhausted, it took me hours to actually fall asleep. I tossed and turned and kept stretching out my muscles, because for some reason I kept having the urge to do it. I also kept rubbing my feet on the sheets. I would say that my sense of touch was definitely heightened throughout the whole trip. When I woke up in the morning, I still felt super tired, and just not really that great. It wasnt until the next day that I actually felt like myself again.    After this experience, I told myself I was never going to do drugs again. I havent kept that promise, but the whole thing did shake me up really bad. I dont think Ill be experimenting with drugs that I havent really heard a lot about anymore."
84307,No Nausea or Side Effects,Deadhead32,"Feb 24, 2016","Morning Glory, H.B. Woodrose & Bupropion","The True LSA Experiance.    The purpose of this report is to provide a clear and objective reference for the curious ethnologists and/or those who are seeking spiritual guidance from a life changing spirit trip. I will began with the preparation and extraction methods I used and then move on to the physical, mental, and spiritual, aspects of the experience. For the record, I do not encourage nor discourage the use of psychoactive substances. I must advise the user to thoroughly research the substance before ingesting it. With that being said, lets get down to business.    1: The first step in preparing the substance involved washing the HB seeds with lighter fluid and allowing the seeds to dry.  2: The second step involved washing the seeds with water for two or three minutes and allowing them to dry.  3: The third step involved crushing the seeds with a mortar and pestle.  4: The fourth step involved adding the powder to spring water with some powdered ginger, mint leaves, ginseng root, and cream of tartar.  5: the fifth step involved crushing up 55 morning glory seeds in the mortar and pestle and adding them to the spring water.  6: the sixth step involved shaking the mixture vigorously for fifteen through thirty minutes.     7: the seventh step involved placing the mixture in the refrigerator for twenty four hours.  8: the eighth step involved me straining and drinking the walnut flavored concoction and tripping balls.    NOTES: The Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds were rather odd in appearance. They had very little fuzz on them and were similar to morning glory seeds. I will investigate these seeds in isolation next week to see if it was only the heavenly blue morning glories that got me high.    During the trip, I was taking notes and discovered some intriguing information. I will write these findings from a first person perspective and comment where appropriate. Lets go!    I have been fasting for fourteen hours now. It is now 10:37am. I just took 500 mg of vitamin C.  It is now 10:40am and i am attempting to drink the mixture. It has a smooth, earthy flavor to it and leaves a after taste not to different from walnuts. It is now 10:50am and I have finished the brew. I am now attempting a sub-lingual method with the seed mush. Its has a rather gritty texture!  It is now 11:03am. I am taking a bath. At about 11:30am I spat out the gritty mush and proceeded to dry my self off. No effects have been noticed, although i did find the thought of me holding all that mush in my mouth for thirty minutes rather humorous.  It is now 11:45am. I am quite giggly. As a matter of fact the very word giggly is making me laugh. Proceeded to listen to Jimmy Hendrix.  At 11:50am I found myself impatient in waiting for a buzz. I took a hand full of about thirty morning glory seeds and chewed them up and held them in mouth for quite some time.  I am getting dressed and beginning to write these notes down. That is when i noticed that it was only 11:51. Time is definitely slowing down. I decided to take a walk. With seed mush still in mouth, I began my journey!  I have been walking for approximately fifteen minutes now. I am now at a lake. I am feeling euphoric now, but when I try to figure out how high I am, it seems to go away. It is a very odd but pleasant feeling.     It has been approximately 35 minutes now. I have been staring at a drainage pipe. The swirls that effortlessly flow through it create a beautiful array of whirling patterns that far surpass any painting I have ever seen. There is a definite emotional high now, the physical buzz I was expecting is not to be found. There are also no profound hallucinations at the moment either. peace! :-)  It is now 1:13pm. My eyes are not dilated and I still feel relatively normal. I proceeded to take a nap and listen to the Grateful Dead. That is when it occurred to me that if science was this cool in school, than I would have made all A\'s. I found this concept absolutely hilarious and accidentally shouted out \' This is my kinda science!\' My parents must have thought I was insane and that made me laugh even more.  AT 1:23pm I chewed and swallowed the reaming morning glory seeds. I have now consumed a total of 8 HB seeds and 150 heavenly blue seeds. The seeds also taste like walnuts.  At 2:15pm I got on the computer and began to read about other peoples experiences with LSA. I must now comment that I have experienced absolutely no nausea and no side effects.  It is now 3:20pm. I am feeling a buzz now. Its light, but its alright!  At 3:32pm I proceeded to open another pack of morning glory seeds and poured myself a large handful of seeds. I popped them in my mouth and began eating them one at a time. This made me laugh hysterically because they reminded me of sun flower seeds.    It is now 3:35pm. I am riding with my sister and grandmother to a mall. This is when the spirit of the seeds escaped.  It is 3:50pm. I just feel like chilling out and watching the cars ride by! I have intense euphoric feelings now. The best comparison would be to that of a large dose of Nutmeg mixed with a strong dose of Marijuana. Everything feels great. I can almost feel the air! This has been the best car ride ever!   It is now 4:28pm. I now proceeded to enter the mall. BAD IDEA!  It is now 5:59pm. Holy $#!+. I made a total ass of my self. I was laughing like a mad man at anything and everything. My eyes are rather black. I am having trouble writing these notes.  It is 6:03pm. we are leaving the mall. My family is oblivious to the fact that I am wasted. The movement of the car feels awesome and the lights are all sparkly.  It is 6:16pm. Got some fast food. I got this huge triple stack bacon burger and extra large drink and fries. I am starving!  IT is 6:27pm. finished eating. That burger has awoken the monster within me! I have the biggest case of the munchies I have ever experienced. For the note, I have smoked lots of pot in the past.   It is now approximately 7:30 or 7:45pm. I just ate 2 huge bowls of ice cream.  It is now 8:00pm. I just ate two sandwiches and a glass of purple sugar water.  It is now 9:01pm. I just ate another sandwich, a apple, a hanfull of crackers and a glass of orange juice.  It is 9:31pm. Ate some chips then drank water from the sink.    It is now 9:39pm. I am out of food. :-( After finding no cure for the munchies, I decided to play video games. It was fun, the patterns on the screen were groovy. There still has been no Profound hallucinations but who cares, I am tripping man!  During my video game adventure I fell back and took a day dream nap, which involves staring at the wall and not blinking at all. NOTE. I can force my self to hallucinate when I do this when I am sober, but I found it to be to much effort. I eventually closed my eyes and thought for a while.  It is now 10:01pm. I turned on the T.V and watched a show about pot. I then remembered that we still have ice cream! I ate the hell out of it and literally chilled out.  it is now 2:00am. I turned off the lights and stayed awake until approximately 2:30am.  I slept for seven hours. My mother awoke me from a dream at 9:29am. The dream involved me dipping a ladder in a huge tub of butter and spreading it on the roof of my house? Carl Jung would have a heck of a time psychoanalyzing that dream.  It is very bright outside and I have a mild headache. I took a vitamin C and went to town with my mother. this is where my notes ended. During the day I seemed to be very irritable and felt like I had a Slight hangover. Other than that no side effects or aftereffects were noticed.    CONCLUSION: I have concluded that the water extraction sucks. It will git about40% through 60% of the LSA out but it is easier to just eat the seeds. I also concluded that vitamin C , ginger, ginseng, and mint are very good at counter acting the nausea that so many claim to experience. Also, I have never heard of anyone getting the munchies from LSA. Furthermore,I am beginning to wonder if my Argyreia nervosa seeds are not actually Argyreia speciosa seeds. According to several reliable sources injesting 8 Hb seeds with 240 morning glory seeds should have produced a strong trip with more visual distortion and euphoria.   All in all the trip was great. It did not produce any significant spiritual insights or experiences that I was so desperately seeking but I attribute that to the relatively low dose. I am planning to study 8 or 12 argyreia nervosa seeds in isolation. After I record the trip I will proceed to ingest and study 15 grams of Ipomoea purpurea seeds in isolation.    NOTES: Anyone considering buying and ingesting argyreia nervosa seeds should buy them from a reliable source. I suggest buying a small amount at first, test them, then buy them if you find them to be of the correct species and quality. There is a relatively new marketing scam revolving around these seeds at the time. It involves the company buying and selling the cheaper, inactive Argyreia speciosa seeds and advertising them as the more expensive and active Argyreia nervosa seeds. Nevertheless, there still easy to git from floral shops, gardens, and anywhere on the internet. You just got to be smart. So with that being said stay high and stay free. Peace out!"
96639,Began to Take More Frequent Lower Doses,mcspoo,"Nov 9, 2015",H.B. Woodrose & Yohimbe,"This is not a normal trip report, this is an analysis of long term use of hbwr in conjunction with yohimbine.     Following my study of the physical effects of LSA-containing seeds I became extremely interested in combining them with the vasodilator yohimbine to prevent the painful vasoconstriction that natural ergolines are famous for and allow for physically safe administration of powerful doses.     Fortunately consuming yohimbine in conjunction with hbwr did do this in addition to intensifying and providing energy and clarity to the experience.     Over a period of several months I consumed this combination many times personally in addition to giving doses to friends. After collecting individual experiences there were some frequent similarities in experiences.    HBWR often causes extreme nausea on the come up. Extraction cannot change this since this is an effect of the active compounds in the seeds... After some number of uses I no longer experienced the purge associated with this trip.    Sometimes, especially if when people did hbwr for the first time they would experience a profound deep physical and mental ecstasy. Usually when this happened the individual could not move. I personally experienced this the second time I consumed hbwr.     Frequently people would have emotionally jarring experiences that would make acid look like a little bitch. One individual, though he said it was the most profound trip of his life said the trip made him question whether any interaction he had ever had was genuine. The follow-up realization was that it was about impossible for him to be able to determine this or not given the nature of human interaction.     Contrary to the statement that this substance does not cause visual hallucinations, it sometimes can be very visual. Although not typical powerful visuals I experienced on hbwr include morphing and swirling of patterns as well as three-dimensional projections of morphing color changing lines, reminiscent of a screen saver.     At higher doses hbwr usually causes extreme delirium, and mind-shattering aural hallucinations. Following the consumption of 30 seeds each with three individuals once each of us peaked we could no longer hear what people were saying, it instead became a hallucination. The hallucination for me became a discussion of all my flaws and failures. As it turns out the conversation I was witnessing was in fact a discussion about titties and road trips. Dx    Person number two realized they could no longer communicate in what had become a bad trip and wept for three hours.     Person number three was no longer with me when he peaked. He had locked himself out of his dorm room and could no longer hear what people said or recognize what people were. Campus police had to fight him to get him to an ambulance to take him to a hospital since they could not communicate with him about what was happening. The officer looked like a ninja by this point. As did the hospital orderlies once he arrived at the hospital. Sadly it was probably good that this person went to the hospital since his solute levels were dangerously low and he was extremely dehydrated.     The nature of the hbwr/yohimbe experience at reasonable doses tended to be so pleasurable and profound that those who were not shocked by the experience wanted to try it again in a short period of time so as to experience the understanding and self clarity they experienced again.     I began to deny people repeat doses as I could tell I was losing my grip on reality due to the effects of this drug. Yet I no longer cared if I personally lost my mind since it was so goddamn beautiful. I began to take more frequent lower doses to extend the psychological effects of the drug throughout my daily life.     In every little thing I came to see how everything was within everything. Our separation as individuals was utterly fake. We were all manifestations of the same existence. We were in fact all the same shit. Yet our separation was both very real and part of the manifestation of this one single existence. Time is an illusion. Infinity exists fully at this very instance. An existence where you decide not to fart at grandma\'s to be polite exists even though in this reality, you cracked off that fart loud and proud. Planet of the Apes fucking exists.     I am you and you are me and we\'re all god and existence is a manifestation of that unity.    It was beautiful. However I no longer cared if I lived or died. It occurred to me that I no longer could function and that regardless of whether or not these pervasive psychotic thoughts were real I did not want to live like this.     So I stopped using hbwr. But the thoughts did not stop. After two months of climbing desperation and no drug use I smoked pot hoping the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol would make it stop. It did. The thoughts stopped immediately. I cried. I was so happy I wept. Like a baby.     They started to creep back. I smoked again 4 days later. I convinced myself they weren\'t real, smoked again 7 days later and they haven\'t come back since. I could probably get them back if I tried.     HBWR is an extremely powerful psychedelic that is particularly risky in terms of triggering schizoid tendencies. Although I used this substance stupidly it made me and others want to do this in a way no other psychedelic I have done has...    Powerful frequent doses of other substances have done nothing like hbwr did to me.    [Reported Dose: \'15-20 seeds\'; original title: \'Wicked HPPD\']"
92663,Nausea and Bliss,Moykle,"Sep 18, 2014",H. B. Woodrose,"A few days ago, me and a friend, \x91X, prepared a whole free day in my empty house to take Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds wed purchased from the Internet. We both smoke weed and have tried MDMA, but it was the first psychedelic experience for both of us.    We awoke early to prepare and consume the seeds. After failing to successfully peel the seeds of their shells entirely, we opted to just crush the seeds into a powder and take half each. We had the equivalent of around 6 seeds each.    We ate them at around 11:30 AM, not having eaten anything for fear of nausea that Id heard so much about. We then sat down in the living room and began watching the TV. We were half-heartedly watching an old episode of Family Guy I had recorded, both quite anxious about the trip.     After about 20 minutes, I began to feel slightly nauseous, and went to the bathroom. The seeds, shall we say, did quite a number on my bowels, and Ill just say that using the toilet was a lot more uncomfortable than usual. Even after I had been, I still didnt feel completely fine but I did feel strange. X had yet to report anything, though he seems to have quite a slow metabolism anyway.    I lied down for a while breathing deeply, my nausea only faintly remaining. At this point X began feeling ill, and went to the bathroom, while I began drawing. X vomited in the toilet and said he felt great after that. Though I did feel like I was going to be sick it wouldnt come and I didnt want to force myself. Eventually the nausea subsided, around an hour and a half after taking the seeds, and I put on some music, a random mix of some of our favourite songs.     At this point we both just lied down on sofas and listened. The music was amazing, I found that I didnt think about the instruments and notes/chords being played as I usually do when listening to music, but rather was just filled with glee at how amazing it was that these musicians had thought to put the notes in the order they were, and they worked so well.    During this time I was staring out of the window, I must have been staring at the house across the street for hours but I wasnt really seeing it, I was more focused on my thoughts which had become very strange. I felt like all that I could concentrate on was one thought at a time, and these thoughts were all very big questions about existence and life. Whenever Id think of something, I just instinctively knew that I knew what the answer to this question was, but it was so obvious that I didnt even need to explicitly think about it.     It was during the time spent listening to music that I began to visually hallucinate to a slight degree. Whenever I looked at the walls of my living room I could see around 4 or 5 shimmering black and white tiny dots in my peripheral vision. I knew for some reason that I had to choose one and look at it, but whenever I looked there it disappeared and I saw more peripheral dots. This didnt get boring and just seemed to interest me the more I did it. I also felt the moving of limbs was interesting and quite light, and constantly moving my leg from left to right gave me a smile that I couldnt get rid of and made me feel ecstatically happy.    In between songs and CDs me and X would exchange laughs at nothing, try and describe what we were thinking and fail to do so and just be unable to move. This went on until about 5 PM. In terms of time, it wasnt necessarily that my perception of it had changed; just that it didnt really matter to me anymore because in my head I had the answer to everything. Time had become irrelevant. At 5, X had to leave to walk home and go to an engagement party (he assures me the walk home was the trippiest thing hes ever done).     At this point I walked around my house thinking of something to do, but I couldnt really focus on what it was I wanted to do because it felt like my thoughts were operating on a separate level to what my body was doing. I eventually sat down and just remained still for about another hour. I could close my eyes and convince myself that I was in an entirely dark room apart from me and the music. It was during this that the strangest thing happened to me, which was that as a song ended on the disk that I was playing, in the gap between it and the next one, I completely fixed my thoughts on the idea that the next song will be Your Mother Should Know by the Beatles, and it was! Bearing in mind that this was one of 4 20+ track disks that we had played that day, in a totally random order of songs that I hadnt looked at twice since burning it, it was certainly very strange and I began saying Woah! to myself a lot.     I then began thinking about spirituality a lot, and could imagine ghosts to be sitting all around me in the living room, although I couldnt see anything. I usually spook myself with this kind of thought but I was oddly relaxed and even a little euphoric that I was spending time with these ghosts, and I felt like I would be able to accept death when it came.     After another hour or so, around 6 o clock, I began to get a sore back from being lied down the entire day, and this was kind of putting a downer on me. I decided to go out into the middle of my fairly small town and buy something. I bought some chocolate and made myself eat it, despite not feeling up to it with my stomach. After being sat on a bench not knowing what to make of anything I saw for a while, I had a brainwave and decided to visit an old friend who I had drifted apart from whose house was only a 15 minute walk away.     I got there, but found his mother there and that my old friend had gone out. I know his mum quite well anyway, and she is probably the nicest person Ive ever met. She invited me in and I stayed and talked to her for about 2 hours, which really cheered me up and put a huge smile on my face. The effects were subsiding now and I felt relatively back to normal, although very happy.     I left my old friends house about 9 PM and was looking forward to having a bath to soothe my aching back and going to bed, but I got caught up with about 20+ people from my old school who I hadnt seen in a while, and ended up walking around talking for a good few hours, then going to a party where I chilled out and talked to a lot of people I didnt know, in an unusually cheery and friendly fashion for me.     I ended up home at around 1 AM and promptly had a bath, got into bed and fell into one of the most comfortable sleeps Ive ever had. The next day I felt completely fine and refreshed, and since Ive felt a lot more open towards people I dont know personally and willing to talk to them, whereas I usually wouldnt be.     In summary, the nausea was quite unsettling, but completely worth the trip, and very useful for showcasing aspects of psychedelics. I hope to very soon try LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, and a wide range of other psychedelics; Ive just unfortunately never had the chance."
101703,I Should Have Done an Extraction,dexnexus,"Feb 21, 2014",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"Before this experience I was researching legal hallucinogens and was already quite fond of DXM. I heard of LSA, which can be found in legal Morning glory or Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. After hearing that it was pretty similar to LSD, I was interested to say the least.    I quickly ordered a bag of 100 HBWR seeds from a vendor in Hawaii. I was quite excited when I received them, and I wanted to consume them as soon as possible. I had read of other users reporting intense nausea or vomiting from HBWR, but I assumed that it probably wouldn\'t affect me much because DXM rarely made me nauseous, though most users report experiencing nausea. I decided to just wash and scrape ten HBWR seeds lightly to remove the \'fuzz.\' I crunched the seeds to tiny pieces in my mouth all at once, and held the pieces under my tongue for about 20 minutes, accidental swallowing a few pieces.    I sat outside and began reading a book to pass the time. After about 10 minutes, I felt somewhat strange, but I assumed it was just placebo. After about 25 minutes, I felt a strong body load and I began developing strange thought patterns. I felt drowsy, but staying awake wasn\'t difficult. I put on some music, but I began feeling nauseous, lightheaded, and dizzy. I attempted to stand up, but experienced painful aches in my legs. It was very difficult to stand for more than 30 seconds. I felt like I was poisoned.    I then tried to get in bed and sleep this off, but about 5 minutes after I fell asleep, a vivid and frightening dream would wake me. The intense nausea began hitting me again, so I finally walked outside and vomited. This was probably the most unpleasant vomiting session I have ever experienced. (I apologize if that\'s TMI) Before I vomited, I fell on my knees due to losing control of my legs. I felt quite uncomfortable throughout the entire experience. I had some interesting CEV\'s, a few auditory hallucinations, and daydreaming, but I was too uncomfortable to really pay attention to them.     Moral of the story? Patience. I should have done an extraction and waited until I was in the perfect mood and setting to experience this substance. My bad experience was most likely due to my impatience and carelessness. I have not tried HBWR since, but perhaps when the time is right, I will do an extraction and responsibly take it. Good experience\'s are always remembered, but bad experiences usually teach you an important lesson on respecting psychoactives, especially hallucinogens."
66481,Good Shit for 1 Trip,iwonttell,"Dec 29, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"My history with any drugs is only 1 year old. I started with alcohol. I was 15 years old and I\'d be 16 that December. It was the end of summer and start of fall and I was out drinking for the 1st time, got bit addicted, I think (drank almost every day). Then started MJ got off alcohol and life started looking bright again. Tried nutmeg many times. It was hell of a fun (maybe lasted too long (usually 3 days)). Now It has been 1 year without alcohol so I think MJ saved me from what my family has gotten into. Now lets go to HBW.    Aah. I feel so good thinking about the 1st experience. I have had 3 experiences with this substance. All with 5 seeds. I am very very happy about having the experiences and very happy to think that they were my last experiences with HBW. I don\'t want to do it to my body again even tho it felt so good.    I ordered 50 HBW seeds from a entheogen shop site. They said it would take 20 business days for me to get them (10 days to send cash from here to there and another 10 to get the seeds to Finland) but it only took 8 business days and I was standing at home with the seeds in my hand. I was very exited. I had promised with my friends that we would try them together but they were all out somewhere and couldn\'t come. I didn\'t want to wait until the next Friday so I just ate 5 seeds. They were hard (really really hard) but I somehow got them crushed with my back teeth. The seeds didn\'t taste like anything so I just held them in my mouth with warm water for like 5 minutes and swallowed. I had read that warm water makes them more potential. No nausea or anything. Clock was about 12:00 (12pm). Its stupid to do drugs when alone!! I don\'t recommend it but at this point I was too exited.    Now it had been 1 hour from the consumption and no effects so I was like \'shit!\'. I started listening to music.    After 3 songs (of Shpongle) I started feeling really really weird. The base of the music got me feeling bad so I turned music off and went to my bed. It was around 13:20 (1.20pm).    After I had laid down for something like 10 minutes I started feeling really good. I was so happy at everything. I just laughed and smiled and rolled around in my bed. The feeling was like I had never felt so bad but at the same time it was clearly the best moment of my life. I was terribly nauseous because I had rolled over the stereo remote and music had turned back on. I just wasn\'t able of turning it off again. Nothing had come even close to it. Not even the 1st time I got pussy. Or my 1st high on MJ. Or umh... Anything...    This was something that I had thought that MDMA would do to me. I\'ll never try that drug, I have reasons.    My girl friend called me during that period and her voice calmed me down so that I was able to have a good conversation. Her every word sounded really sexy and they kept bouncing in my head for after the phone call. And I started laughing and rolling around again after the call.    It lasted till 14:30 (2.30pm) and then I was finally able to get a hold of my self. I started cooking. Eating was the weirdest thing on the whole trip. It was close to the feeling when eating fruit candy while on nutmeg (crazy shit!!!) but much more intense. It felt like the food was alive and jumping around my mouth. After I got the plate empty the music (I still hadn\'t turned it off) started feeling good. My muscles moved around in the riddim and I felt very close to the music. At the side I saw the mirror in my room and my eyes were really fucked up. The black area had taken over the whole colored shit.    This continued till 20:00 (8pm). All the effects were still fully on but I had gotten used to it. I was waiting for the comedown. It didn\'t come.    21:00 (9pm) No comedown even tho the internet said it would take 8 hours max. This has happened with every other substance too. The effects last longer on me than my friends. The substances react differently on different persons!    21:20 (9.20pm) I was so tired even tho it was too early to go sleep. I usually go sleep 23:00. But I was too tired to stay up. When I held my eyes closed I saw weird Inca statues (very complicated looking structures) covering the whole sight. This continued until I was asleep.    No side effects at the morning. Woke up around 11:00 (11am)    The 2nd and 3rd experiences were almost the same. Only 2 things were different: the seeds started tasting very bad and I had problems with eating them (the 3rd time this point was very overwhelming) and the other thing was that I didn\'t get the good laughing part that I so much loved.     The 1st experience was really good and I think that it would have been good as a last experience. The 2nd was not so good and the 3rd didn\'t offer anything new.    The side effects were: blurred vision for 2 days after the 3rd trip and hardness on reaching orgasm. I noticed the last thing when I was with my girlfriend. It was not such a bad thing: she now gets orgasm far before I do so she pleasures me with her mouth to the end after she has reached hers. I like that thing :).    I still have 20 seeds and all of my friends that wanted to try have tried so I\'ll give the last of them to some random bum.    Outcome:    - too long lasting  -- blurred vision after 3rd trip (didn\'t see shit unless I was 10 feet away from the objects)  - nausea while coming up (more bad when music on)  -- bad taste on 2nd and 3rd trip    +++ Moodlift (much like I had thought that \'euphoria\' would be)  + Inca visions the eyes closed  + cheap to buy and easy to get  +++ not addicting  ++ free blowjobs :D    Grade: 4/5 good shit for 1 try!    That\'s all this time!    Peace, Love and Light"
93925,A Brush with the Obvious and Unexpected,Adepto,"Jun 30, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"- Description of mindset & setting -    What follows is one of the most eventful and powerful of my experiences with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.    To bring the reader up to speed - in brief, I shall share how I started using the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.    On my 18th birthday I went to Amsterdam. I took Woodrose there, not knowing what the seeds did. I was to be presented with the most astounding experience of my life.    My first trip brought to light a lot of psychological baggage and misunderstandings I had acquired. On Woodrose one is able to very honestly look at people and instinctively understand how they are feeling and what is going on. I saw a lot of insecure people filling the streets, forcing conversation and partaking in activities they did not really feel comfortable with. I realised I was just a kid and a lot of my expectations for myself were unreasonable. I should relax.    Further Woodrose use brought me upon the idea that we are all one consciousness. I later realised that people actually came to that idea themselves. For me that was an affirmation that my experiences was not a result of my psychology.    Eventually I went abroad to study, and met a friend with similar philosophical interests. I told him about Woodrose and we agreed to take it together.    At that point my reading took me as far as Robert Monroe\'s books, which talk about astral projection.    - Details of any preparations made for the experience -    Eventually I decided that I was very reluctant to take the Woodrose again. The experience usually turned sour once I was alone and lying in bed, because my mind would turn upon itself due to insecurities or unresolved issues. However, my friend convinced me to do it anyway and that everything would be fine. I decided I had given him my word I would do it with him and went to his apartment.    - The Trip -    [6:00PM] I relaxed as we peeled the seeds and listened to music and talked casually.  We took the seeds at sunset, both very excited for what was to come.    [7:00PM] It usually takes an hour after ingestion for the seeds to kick in powerfully. After an hour nothing much seemed to be happening. We decided to go for a walk.    [7:30PM] My friend became grumpy and hostile. The seeds made us feel sick and confused. I felt that the trip was going to be a nauseating disaster. We cancelled our walk and went back to his room and put music on again.    [8:00PM] Lying back listening to music, the seeds finally start to kick in. The nausea fades and we become relaxed. My mind is thinking, thinking, thinking. How do I learn the Truth? How do I discover the true nature of reality? I am extremely frustrated, as I had been for a year, with my own lack of progress spiritually. We just continue relaxing.    [8:30PM] My friend looks at me. We had been sitting in silence. He says:  \'Ah. I see what your problem is. You\'re looking at it the wrong way.\'  It appeared like telepathy, like he could visually see what I was thinking and feeling. He then sad:  \'I feel like I have got a message for you.\'    He went to his laptop and put on Tool\'s Lateralus. Before this, I had never heard Tool before.    [8:45] Tool\'s Lateralus starts playing; the song he felt guided to play for me. I find the lyrics to fit perfectly what I had been struggling with; I had been \'over thinking, over analysing\' the nature of reality, seeking Truth in the wrong places.    [8:55]] As the song winds to an end, I feel it. My memory struggles to fit together the pieces of that moment perfectly, but I remember it well enough...    It was as if the top of my head had been lifted off, as if the concrete at the back of my mind had broken open.    There is an immense, powerful presence there. It is absolutely godlike. With no prior expectations of anything like this being possible, I was feeling an entity.    The entity felt very indifferent to me, very indifferent to the physical world, making me feel as if my struggle was below interest. However, the entity revealing itself to me was like a preview of what was to come. I had been searching for Truth in a manner that was unproductive, and the entity had given me a hint through Tool\'s Lateralus and by letting me brush against its consciousness.    It was an immense presence of a being so far evolved that where it came from was incomprehensible. There were no visuals. It was all a feeling.    [9:00PM] The presence faded. I felt relieved at finally being granted a breakthrough towards Truth. I lie back on the bed and stop thinking.    [9:30PM] My friend and I are lying side by side, the social and physical barriers between us broken down. We were happy to hold one another in a completely platonic way. Society made it improper for men to show that kind of affection, even though we all secretly want it. Because society has made it improper, we all have a repression in our communication. We feel that only with a sexual partner can we be allowed to show that sort of intimacy. And that is why we have so many problems in the world.    [9:45PM] My consciousness is fading into a primordial state of being. I feel like I am a hunter gathered thousands of years ago.    I begin to narrate how man has gotten himself into the sad position he is in today. It went something like this.    There was a time when communication was non-verbal. There were no barriers between mankind, we understood one another and accepted one another perfectly well. We lived in simplicity and unity.    Then came spoken language. Spoken language created enormous opportunities for misunderstandings and miscommunication between us. The misunderstandings gave rise to culture, which was artificial. Culture separated us, divided us, made us afraid of one another. In our fear we strengthened our separation, afraid of being hurt, afraid to trust and be as close as we used to be.    [10:00PM] I have been staring into the eyes of my friend. Most people avoid extensive eye contact because it is scary - the saying, the \'the eyes are the windows to the soul\' seems appropriate. We limit eye contact and put on a mask to hide who we really are. My friend and I, however, are trying to be ourselves. We maintain eye contact, even though it is scary.    [10:15PM] My friend feels sick due to the seeds. He vomits. We soon part ways and I go home, my friend wanting to be alone.    [10:30PM] In my room I settle down, loving its familiarity and its comfort and softness. For once, being alone is not scary.    I am sitting on my bed when I well and truly realise. All we want is to be loved. Everybody just wants to be loved.    The opposite of love is fear. All bad things in the world are a result of that fear which separates us and prevents us from working together. We can never find peace unless we conquer our fear of one another.    As soon as I realise all this, something happens that I did not think was possible and did not believe in. I cannot stress enough that I had no expectations of this happening.    My third eye opened. It is a feeling that is hard to describe.    It is like a brilliant line of vertical energy along my forehead flaring to life. It expands, opening like an eye.    Meanwhile, I am having extremely heavy visuals of a kaleidoscopic nature, all emanating from the \'third eye\'. It is a feeling of love and understanding and immense energy. I did not believe in chakras, and I still do not \'believe\' in chakras. To this day I consider that experience a metaphor, even though chakras may indeed be real.    But as my third eye was opening, I was struggling mentally to master it, to hold on to it. My grasping physically distanced me from the experience and it faded eventually. I don\'t think I was capable of holding it for long and it may have closed again, because I am still inexperienced and young. However, the realisation that all we want is to be loved caused it to happen, because it was such an important revelation that it carried a lot of energy and changed me from the inside immediately. That experience struck me to my core and has changed my life and how I see people ever since.    Because of that revelation I can hate nobody and feel that every single person on Earth is capable of being my best friend. When somebody offends me or hurts me I know it is out of ignorance and I can not take it personally. People are not evil, they are only afraid. They want the same things I do - to be happy. So when Gaddafi was killed this year, I only felt pity for him and for the people who feared him enough to kill him.    - My Evaluation -    That trip was full of experiences I had no prior conditioning or exposure to. I did not expect them to happen. I did not think they were possible - and that is why I think they were genuine. If exactly what I had expected to happen had happened, then I could have blamed my psychology more readily.    I have had more spiritual experiences ranging from telepathy to waking up seeing a panorama of stars to all sorts of things since that day, but that trip remains one of the most important, if not the most powerful, trip that I have had. I have also met people who have had similar experiences, from the evolved entities to the telepathy. And my search goes on. It has only been a few years since Amsterdam and I have my whole life ahead of me to find out more. I remain hopeful.    It has not been easy, and it is as they say, that there is no magic pill which can make all your problems go away. I told my friend this when his life went back to normal afterwards. I believe he was very disappointed that his life was not perfect afterwards. The drugs open up our potential, but only we can work to make that mean anything. If we are not ready, the drugs won\'t show us anything we haven\'t already earned or learned. The drugs simply provide a new framework to work within for a while."
73282,Introspective Purgatory,lostpilot,"Nov 9, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"To start with, I think I have a drug history - shrooms, cannabis, hashish, MDMA, Morning Glory seeds. And this time I decided to try some HBW; basic interest in hallucinogens led me to a head shop in Dublin, Ireland. I asked the assistant for something hallucogenic and legal - he offered me HBW seeds, and that is how I got hold of them. I kept them for few weeks, until I have tried them the first time - with my few friends, in the woods. The effect then (drowsiness, nice euphoric feeling and a slight perception change.. and of course the blur in the eyes) was very light, so I waited for one week more until the day came, yesterday, when I was alone at home. I have been planning this for quite long, tripping all alone, therefore my mindset was naturally a bit anxious with high expectances. Also, I did not eat from the morning to get the best effects. So, the second time came, one of the most intense and potent experiences in my life.    There was not much of a preparation for the seeds - the manufacturer contained four mashed seeds in one pill, so I just took other two seeds, took a knife and got rid of that shaggy surface of them - I thought this would help me overcome the nausea. In addition to this, the first time I\'ve tried the seeds, they gave me a slight but not too unpleasant nausea. I am sorry for not tracking the time too much, I just know few dots in the timeline.    1:00 PM (00:00) - I swallow the mashed seed pill with four seeds in it. I decide not to rush with the other two, and go to a shop nearby to buy some ice cream (this may sound stupid - but when I bought the seeds, the assistant told me ice cream should help my stomach cope with the poison seeds expose). In few minutes - that immediately - I started feeling a slight discomfort in my stomach, anyway, I bought my ice cream, some newspapers and got back home.     1:20 PM (+00:20) - I decide to eat two more of seeds, chew them for a minute and swallow down. After about five minutes I feel more discomfort in my stomach, so decide to take a hit of some cannabis, since it works as antiemetic. While waiting for the effects to come I decide to play some games on my pc.    About 2:30 PM (+01:30) - My stomach feels very uncomfortable, plus I got the leg cramps, so I decide to put some music on (whole discography of The Appleseed Cast - thanks god I chose this band, it kept me going in a good way) and to lie down. As I rest there, I started thinking whether or not the effects will increase, am I going to feel the same discontent feeling throughout the whole trip.. after a while I noticed a different way about everything, a different perception in general - just as I have always felt when I am on shrooms.    3:00 (+02:00) - I feel different, and a bit delirious, the colours are somewhat brighter, every thing has this weird glow. I am still not able to understand do I like this or not, because the nausea is increasing greatly. I focus on a picture on my wall - Salvador Dali\'s \'Elephants\' - and I noticed the picture is breathing, just as everything else. After a while I focus on the wall, something attracts my attention there - my walls are with patterns on them, that\'s my wallpaper - and now I noticed my walls are blank, smooth and light. I would have enjoyed this more, but the nausea kept me close to the ground, so I made myself comfortable and enjoyed the music (The Appleseed Cast - Low Level Owl. Almost two hour journey of music).    After about ten minutes, when the Low Level Owl started with the opening song, I noticed myself actively dreaming. I was revisiting very many places in only few moments - revisiting my past, my dreams, my imaginative visions. Let me tell a bit about myself - I am very dreamlike person in general. I recall my dreams very clearly, have had lucid dreams, many false awakenings and so on, so generally I tend to doubt the existence of being in general. I question the perceptions, whether or not everything is one dream or reality. And now I was going back to all these scenarios, revisiting my dream worlds, every single dream with every single emotion there. And after a while I understood I was not the one doing this - it was the substance, opening the gates of dreamlike world to me.    And then, when few minutes of introspective dreamlike experience ended, everything switched to a different direction - instead of going back to my old dreams a new one began - but I clearly understood that I was lying there, in this state of being, with music on - I fell into my dream. The dream was unexpectedly picturesque and somewhat humorous - I watched myself, acting, of course, in a very different manner, escape from one huge, but then again laughable bear. While the pursuit continued through the woods, I noticed it was dependent on the music, Low Level Owl, Volume 1. I watched something like one movie with grotesque happenings, and I was the actor, I was there. Long after, this scenario ended very very humorously - the bear exploded, leaving one very small copy of himself, all miserable and helpless - and me and my friends (no idea who were they or where did they come from) took the little bear, got on a flying carpet (oh the absurd!) and flew away somewhere.    Right after this I \'woke up\', understanding this was only a trip. I then understood I felt no nausea at all, and tried to stand up, but just as I moved upwards, my stomach started aching again, so I decided to lie again. I again looked at \'Elephants\', noticing the elephants in the picture are moving slightly - I have always wanted to see this while tripping, so this made me feel very glad. Then, just as Low Level Owl, Volume 2 started, something again dragged me into the state of introspective dreamlike reality. And, again, after few minutes (which seemed to last for hours) of revisiting moments of my past, another dream has begun - this time even more absurd and grotesque. The chase continued.    Me, and the same friends flying on the carpet noticed something wrong happening (by the way, then I understood this part of the trip was illustrative, like a comic book, only in action), and we saw the Joker, yes, the same Joker from Batman attack us. That was when my mind shivered and stopped this absurd insanity, so the dream crashed and I \'woke up\' only when few of the songs ended. And then came the ecstatic purgatory. Then I thought crushed my mind - I have been actively thinking about pushing the envelope harder, going deeper into this trip, and then I understood how abusive to HBW was I. This just came into my mind, how exploitative I was, not appreciating what the seeds gave me, I wanted more without even starting enjoying what it gave me already. And then I heard myself just saying things in voice, things like \'Thank You\' or \'I promise not to exploit you any more\', because right at that moment I felt as if I was choking the substance while trying to get the best of it. And that was the wrong way.    That is why it gave me that much nausea, which by then came back in a very bad way. Overall, my physical state at that moment (as I can guess, about +03:30-04:00) was very bad - nausea got back, my body, especially legs, were twitching, I had to move all the time, and this ecstatic wall of pleasure was pushing me deeper into the ground. I felt as if I was one of those silly kids who overdosed and poisoned themselves, and will be found this way. And then I again apologized the substance for abusing it for a thousand times, again and again. And when I done it, I do not know if that was purely physical, every bad feeling of the previous state made me feel good. Only then I understood how profound this experience was, so I just made myself comfortable again, and listened to some more music, giggling all the way.     More than two hours after this (until about 7:00 PM (+06:00)) were the afterglow of the purgatory. Sometimes coming back, sometimes getting away.. All this time I just been lying there, already wanting this to end, while my mind was rushing backwards and forwards, not finding proper rest. All I wanted to do was to fall asleep, but then I understood I am not able to.. I felt so tired, ecstatically tired. But then again, the waves of pleasure were coming in and out, and most of the time I was glad that I went through this. This gave me a lesson. After those hours which seemed like forever and even more I finally was able to stand up and go make myself some food. I turned off the music, went to the kitchen, turned something stupid on the TV, made myself some food and read the newspapers. It felt really good, being back to state of almost normal.    The rest of the night I felt very tired, but yet content. To sum up, I am very glad I had this experience, but I know that I will not ingest HBW for quite a long time.. maybe when I will need some answers to my questions inside my head (which were given to me this time, not have I mentioned them)."
41042,Hard Natural Trip,Particle16,"Mar 2, 2010","HBW, Mushrooms, Nitrous Oxide, Salvia divinorum, Blue Lotus, Cannabis, Poppy & DMT","Hawaian Baby Woodrose (8 seeds)  Magic Mushrooms (1 block in chocolate)  NOS (50 ISI chargers)  Salvia Divonorum 5x Extract (half cone)  California Poppy & DMT (half cone)  Blue Lotus (half cone)  Marijuana (half cone)    Having been off all drugs since the morning of the 1st of January, a while day to be exact, we decided to give Hawaian Baby Woodrose seeds a try, hearing that they contained LSA which was a far more enjoyable trip than current street acid. The husk was removed with a knife and also washed off, the seeds were left to soak in warm water after being chewed and spat back into the individual glasses. They were then absorbed when the water was cool, but in retrospect it would have been less than an hour since eating a small meal, probably not the wisest decision as we were warned of nausea. Being around 100kg, I chose to try 8 seeds, with my girlfriend around 60-70 having 6 seeds, and another friend of similar weight trying 4 seeds. While he tripped lightly and felt little to nausea, me and my girlfriend both felt quite sick for a good 2 hours. Little tripping as such was felt as quite horrible nausea and thinking of spewing up were deep in our thoughts at all times.    Getting quite tired of feeling so sick, I suggested we have a few bulbs of NOS and hopefully numb the stomach and the thoughts (note, jumping into a cold swimming pool is far easier on a bulb of NOS) - still having 120 left from New Years. I believe they were definatelly accelerated and enhanced by the LSA content (as NOS on street acid is), and we proceeded to each use a lot of NOS in a 2.5 hour block, attempting different things such as walking around on lower hits, as well as loading each other up to have quick successive hits with minor oxygen intake, care was taken not to reach the \'blue lips\' feeling often experienced by heavy NOS users. After only a few bulbs the sickening feeling of the seeds was removed, and we decided to have a block of Magic Mushrooms in chocolate each. The mushrooms on their own were never felt, but once again I believe they also increased the quality of the bulbs though they were probably a waste at this stage. The NOS experiences were quite standard, but several outstanding bulbs were experienced.     One in particular was a powerful delay where I found my awareness and vision return before both proper hearing and self-realisation, and i found the ability to slowly rise to stay within a perfect nitrous place for an extended period of time (potentially a few more seconds) and at the same time look straight ahead at the awesome view we were presented with (at a holiday place by the river). Several of the bulbs were in this way able to be analysed much better, though still not as intense as the mixture of nitrous oxide with ecstasy & post ketamine.     About an hour after the bulbs ran out, and almost 6-7 hours after the LSA seeds were first taken, I decided to put the bong I brought with me to good use, and loaded up 2 cones. The first contained California Poppy laced with DMT, as well as Salvia Divonorum 5x extract. As I smoked this outside in the pitch black night, I only felt the slightly calming effect of the California Poppy and the light confusion that I gather comes from the DMT. This only lasted a few seconds and I was quickly back loading up a cone with some strong hydroponic marijuana and blue lotus. Having smoked this I quite quickly felt quite stoned, within 2 minutes I had left the room and staggered quite slowly into the toilet, where I simply sat upon the closed lid. I had started feeling quite sick and was almost sure that I\'d vomit within the next few minutes, so I put my head back against the wall and started thinking of other things. Very quickly I noted visualisations moving before me, and time came almost to an absolute standstill. The visualisations were very slow rotating patterns of blue and red colours, quite dull and moving very slowly in a fractal formation. As I viewed them I noticed a very loud deafening buzz coming around me and within a few seconds I had blanked out.     The next moment that I remember was my reality slowly coming back. At first I noticed little particles or my fractal visions returning, first quite dark and slowly getting lighter as my general spectrum of vision before me was appearing. The buzzing in my ears was slowly subsiding and I could feel a strange chill over me. I quickly realised this was the sweat that always appears on me when smoking Salvia Divonorum, and the fan of the toilet had been blowing at me quite hard for the past few minutes getting me to feel this cold. It was several moments still until I could bear to open my eyes and actually realised where I was. From what I\'m told by my friends, I was away for enough time for them to worry about me, but they assumed I had gone for a lie down in the bedroom. It was quite a terrifying experience having reality slowly melt away, and then awaken back in what appeared to have almost been a highly delayed nitrous hit spaced over a good twenty minutes. Another strange fact is that I had smoked Salvia Divonorum in 3-4x the quantity previously (attempted 5 times in the last year with next to no success), and even held it on for a lot longer than on this occasion, yet only this mix and general presence of other psychoactives in my body had finally triggered it."
63404,Unpleasant,Dagge,"Feb 13, 2010",Rivea corymbosa seeds & H.B. Woodrose,"I have tried different seeds containing LSA over 2 years and I find the substance very interseting. Three days ago a friend called and said he had just got some seeds he had ordered from the internet and he wanted to try them out with me. After school I got to his apartment and we counted the seeds. It was 37 Rivea Corymbosa and 10 HBW each. My mindset was calm and it was a perfect grey day. My experience from LSA-seeds is that you should take a few and then wait for at least half an hour.    1500. We take about five coymbosa each and chew them for five minutes, then swallow, very bitter taste. My friend tells me to take some more, I thought that the corymbosa was some weak crap that really wouldnt work so I took the rest 32 seeds and my friend takes his.    1530 I\xb4m feeling very tired and the room feels strange, almost hostile. (I have very low tolerance for almost every drug I\xb4ve tried) We listen to infected mushroom and laugh at nothing, feelings of well being though the room feels hostile and very foreign.     1545 We take the first two HBWs and decide to go out for a walk. We got to a nice spot by the river and both where feeling dissorientated and looking inwards into ourselves. Kind of psykadelic and at the same time sedating, very calm and inwards. We take the rest of the HBW.    1600 Slowly I\xb4m loosing my grip on reality and I cant concentrate on what my friend says. We take our bicykles and he follows me for a bit on the way home. Time is going very fast now and the clouds in the sky are moving faster then possible. We stop in a park and throw up and then I go home.    1615: I\xb4m lying in my bed not knowing whether I\xb4m dead or alive. My pulse is fast and very weak, hardly noticable and I think I have three hearts and three lungs. I float out and in of my body and my body constantly changes shape and the organs are moving around and increase in numbers. I think I\xb4m going to die at this point and every three minutes (or every 15) I go to the bathroom to pee. My mom asks me if I\xb4m drunk and I say no I\xb4m just tierd. My pupills are enormous and I\xb4m pale and shaking.     I decide I have to get some food so I take some leftovers out of the fridge. It takes forever to put the food on a plate and still it\xb4s a very small portion of food. I feel so sick when I eat and it\xb4s hard beacause my hands are chaning shape. When I look at my watch it looks like salvador Dalis watch, its melting and the hands are all crooked and time is going too fast.     1945: I still think I\xb4m going to die so I walk up too my mom and say I dont feel so good. she says I can have one of my zolpidem pills now and I shouldnt worry. (I suffer from a mental illness, I know I shouldn\xb4t do drugs) When the pill kicks in I dont think about all the weird stuff around me and I am no longer transforming and changing organs. Now I am a steelbar with two steelarms instead and I feel better. When I watch TV I\xb4m sucked into the programs and I cant read the text in the shows.     2100: I take the other zolpidem pill and fall asleep confused and laughing.    The next day I couldnt concentrate on anything and for some reason I liked Gwen Stefani (open mind). Now, three days later I\xb4m still in this strange world I entered through those seeds, it\xb4s far better then the first day but still I suffer from blurred vision, no feeling in my face and my hands are growing and changing form. It\xb4s like I get flashbacks now and then and I really hope I will get out of this. My advice: DON`T TAKE TOO MUCH."
55416,Most Underrated Substance Ever,Skien,"Jan 20, 2010",H.B. Woodrose & Clonazepam (Klonopin),"So after hearing various stories and trip reports from other people and online, I came to the conclusion that it wouldn\'t turn out to be anything too spectacular. Boy was I wrong.  My friend and I were planning on just getting together for a few drinks. Just to relax a little after a night of moderately heavy drinking the night prior. Nothing too extravagent. I mean, it was Sunday afterall. Then, we decided to give something else a try. We decided to add a little something else to the overall experience. I\'ve had these HBWR seeds lying around for a few months now and so decided to put them to good use.  Well, I figured that, from all the stories I\'ve heard on this drug, that it wouldn\'t be all that intense. Still though, to be on the safe side, we only ingested 3.5 (yes THREE and a half) seeds each. Before hand, we each drank a beer and popped 1 mg of clonazepam to kinda ease the trip, just in case. Then we went and followed the sublingual procedure documented online.  So we had this seed/water/lime/sugar mix soaking in our mouths for about 15 minutes while watching TV, trying not to laugh and letting it all come out.  Passing a piece of paper and a pen back and forth to communicate.  There was even a bit of a debate on whether to spit or swallow.  After the 15 minutes were up, we swallowed the entire concoction. Afterwards, I slammed back another beer, and drove my moms car back to her place before I ended up getting really intoxicated.  [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    So at this point, we\'re walking back to his place from my moms (not too far, about a 20 minute walk). He claims to be coming up, or feeling something. I thought I was at first, but I just chalked it up to placebo. Like I said, I was grossly missinformed of the intensity of LSA. Once it fully kicked in, after about an hour or so (it kicked in much faster for my friend), it was much more intense than I was expecting. I have done many drugs (shrooms, MDMA, heroin, DXM, crack, crystal meth, etc - just to name a few) Yet I actually consider LSA one of the most amazing drugs I\'ve ever taken, and this is saying ALOT coming from me. Ecstacy has been my favorite drug for nearly 5 years. Nothing else has come close. LSA, on the other hand, has actually made it to rivalry status.  Basically, my fear of hallucinogens (due to my mental condition), was that I figured I was pretty much guaranteed a bad trip. The LSA actually felt a bit like a mix between MDMA and shrooms. The mind fuckingness of shrooms, and the euphoria and body high of MDMA. I also had energy too. It was like the ultimate combination of all the best features of each and every drug. I laid back for a while, just feeling. Simply feeling, enjoying the waves of pleasure as they rolled through my body (kinda like E, but a bit different). I could just sit there, recline, and actually feel it in my face. Pure pleasure. It was overwhelming to say the least.  Also, there were visual distortions, which I have never seen before (not even from shrooms or DXM or anything). It was amazing. The walls were actually melting. I always thought that was some drug cliche, but it was happening. Everything was slightly distorted. My mental state was a bit disturbed, but in a good way. I felt good, even though I was absolutely mind-fucked. I tried to go for a walk out to this park, by myself. The walk alone was unbelievable. Time seemed to alternate between fast and slow. I could feel every motion in my body. Everything passing by seemed so surreal.  My depth perception was quite off. I also kept feeling lost, but would soon realize what road I was on, although making that distinction was hard at times. I ended up laying on the grass, just watching cars go by. Feeling very good. At one point, I turned off all the lights, and turned up the music (Mr. Bungle - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TRIPPING MUSIC). This made for a rather intense experience.  I am definitely planning on trying it again.  Also, I recall being warned of leg cramps as a side effect. That really was the only negative side effect I experienced. It was a bit bothersome, but practically negligible in comparison to the overall experience."
58477,Retrospective of My Life,AnX,"Jan 20, 2010",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'m a 20 year old student. I am not a regular drug user. I do love to take psychedelic drugs whenever I have an option to get them. I did shrooms a couple of times, tried Salvia which didn\'t work for me. So I wouldn\'t consider myself an expert in the field of psychedelic drugs.     New years eve... Me and my friend, we\'ve been planning to do something for a month. In the end both previous plans failed, in the end we settled on some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I ordered awhile ago from a headshop. I did it once before, but I was alone, it was a bit overwhelming. So I knew what to expect. We took the seeds around 22.30. I ate some food earlier, because I expected to throw up and I\'d rather see that I have something in my stomach to throw up, because the last time it was a bit annoying. So I took 4 seeds, she took 3.    Started out pretty normal, it was as I hoped to be. The stuff kicked in after awhile, but really kicked in around midnight. The nausea was present, at some points it was more powerful, on other points a bit less, well I just got really busy so I was able to ignore it is my best guess. We were making jokes, laughing. I was bursting with energy. It was what I expected. Everything felt really nice, physical touches were just divine, not in a sexual way or anything. But just felt really good. We were holding each other in embrace and laughing and having fun. Even though I had a lot of energy, I was incredibly lazy. It does that to me, makes movement impossible. After awhile we moved to my room, the bed was much more comfortable. Music choices were pretty interesting I\'d like to add, first we began with some Pavement. It felt really good, we were joking about the fact that who actually signed those guys up. Don\'t get me wrong, Pavement rocks, it was just a friendly joke.    It was funny, we joked about everything I recall myself actually mentioning the fact, that I have no idea how could this state be philosophical, introspective or anything. Speaking of the devil... Suddenly all changed, the initial rush of laughter and jokes stopped and that\'s where the most amazing new year\'s eve in my life actually began. She\'s a good friend of mine and I trust her, we\'ve been really good friends, and at that point I\'ve decided something changing. I said : Hey I want to talk to about myself. How egocentric eh? But that\'s when the flow of thoughts was released. My life, me in a nutshell. I started just talking about everything, my feelings, my character, how I perceive myself, what I did, what I thought about my friends, family and everyone around me. In that moment I was able to clearly formulate my thoughts in my mind. I was aware of all those things, but I never could actually express them. It was great she was there, because I realised she\'s one of the few people in my life that would be able to follow me.    So I talked and talked and talked and every story I told just forked, split on several times. Threads were opening, I was jumping up and down throughout my life and thoughts. Opening every aspect, for the first time I was able to talk openly about some things that were just hidden in my mind. It felt great. It was amazing. At that point I figured out this was the best new year\'s eve I could ever imagine. The music changed here we put on mostly different electronic ambient artists, calm things. Antimatter\'s Planetary Confinement was great not electronic though, Monolake\'s Honk Kong also felt nice etc. I was really enthusiastic about music, I really felt connected to it. Loved to talk about it.     After I was done talking about myself, my friend began to get sleepy, she took a bit less than me, so I was still feeling the effects. But my energy was dying out as well. At this point the closed-eye visuals were a lot more intense, or I just began to notice them, they were mushroom-like, but more chaotic, they were there, but it was hard to actually put them into patterns. I couldn\'t make myself comfortable, the nausea was kicking in again, stronger than ever. Annoying, on the other hand my back ached a bit more than usual, I\'m not getting enough exercise, so that\'s the main reason, but the drug felt like it enhanced it, made it more uncomfortable.    At one point the nausea became unbearable. I ran to the bathroom where I threw up. Looking at the toilet, I thought to myself that hey, I don\'t want this to spoil it. If shamans think that when taking Ayahuasca throwing up can be looked as purging your body and mind. I said I\'ll take it like this, it\'s my closure, the end of the trip and what a trip it was. I smiled, cleaned myself, went back to bed, it was all over, I had some problems sleeping. But after awhile I made it.    In the time I\'m writing my report it\'s about 24 hours since I ingested the seeds. I\'m getting back to normal, throughout the day I was pretty much unresponsive and still now I\'m thinking about this experience and how it was. It was a wonderful experience. Gave me a lot to think about come to think of it. Also very exhausting, I probably won\'t do Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for quite awhile, I don\'t think my mind could actually handle it. At least half a year. Or even more. But this changed my opinion on LSA completely, it has to be treated with respect and it can be your best friend otherwise it can be a nightmare."
56388,Low Dose at Bedtime,Jarrid,"Jan 20, 2010",H.B. Woodrose & Melatonin,"Lately, I have been quite curious to try out some new things, preferably in the natural range.  A close friend of mine suggested I try out a few things and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose was one of those recommendations.  Through my history with psychedelic substances, I have tried psilocybin, LSD, Salvia Divinorum, and MDMA (if that counts).  I love them all, but since the quality and quantity is horrible where I live, I have learned to use other resources in order to enlighten myself when I have the time to do it.      I ordered a total of 50 seeds from an online herb/seed store and got them in on a Monday.  That night I told myself it would probably be better to wait until tomorrow since I was so tired.  Tuesday rolls around, and I get off work at around 12:00am.  I\'m fairly excited to try it out, but I didn\'t feel like staying up until 7:00am in the morning tripping my balls off.  I came to a conclusion: eat two seeds before I go to bed and take my melatonin.     Well, I ate the two seeds, felt a little rumble in my stomach, and took my daily herbs and vitamins (vitamin C, Ginseng, Spurlina, St. Johns Wart), and then my melatonin.  I always alternate with my melatonin after every night.  I go from 6mg to 9mg to 6mg and so forth.  Before I passed out, I noticed things were getting a little stranger than usual, but nothing really dramatic.  My white room seemed a bit brighter, and the TV was a little louder than normal.  I slept for about seven hours straight without and disturbances.  I woke up and noticed things were a bit more vivid, my mood was positive, and I was ready to get going for work.    Work was excellent that day.  I was in fun loving mood, my surroundings were rich in color, and I was wide awake without any stomach troubles whatsoever.  After work I ventured into my room and smoked a bowl of salvia divinorum to calm myself, and went a long playing my videogame for about an hour.  I pondered to myself: if I repeated what I did last night, will it happen again?  I ate three more seeds that night.  My stomach acted up a little more than what it did the previous night, but nothing really serious.  I woke up the next morning in almost the same manner.  Work that day went along the same way it did yesterday.  I enjoyed my time at work and loved being around the people there.    For one whole week now I have been taking about 2-4 seeds every night before I\'ve gone to bed, and I have been waking up in a great mood.  I\'m not exactly sure whether prolonged use of HBW is dangerous to the internal organs, but I have not noticed any side effects whatsoever.  I have yet to try it while awake, so I\'m a bit curious on what will happen if I do that."
57739,"Jung, Sex and The Battle of Types",Zattang mahamaya,"Jan 20, 2010","H.B. Woodrose, Inhalants - Nitrates (Poppers) & Zaleplon (Sonata)","Ok lets cut to the chase - this wasn\'t a meticulously engineered cocktail. Things just unfolded as they do in my crazy life. My friend came down to London and suggested that we score some hallucinogens. We decided to be good citizens and go legal. A shop in Camden made that happen. The woman at the counter was a complete waste of space, she had zero credibility and blithely assured us that 4 seeds would be plenty, but having done HBW once and been sorely dissappointed by the lacklustre experience of mild dizziness and occassional blurring of vision  - We decided to up the ante and go for 12 each. We got home in a hurry and and chewed the lot thoroughly after a determined searched for a mortar and pestle yielded nada. It did not matter as the seeds crunched easily under our teeth, tasting slightly bitter. We both braced ourself for an hour or so of chewing the fat before feeling an effect.     Minutes later however we were both experiencing a certain edginess suggesting the faint but definite prodrome of a trip. We had both eaten a substantial meal about 2 hours before. I lay on the bed reading a book, while Ronin - my friend, watched TV in the living room. A half hour later both of us began feeling really drowsy. My body tingled a bit and I closed my eyes, but there were no closed eye visuals. It was a bit like the tail end of a weed trip and about as exciting as taking an antihistamine. I must have dozed off for a few minutes, experiencing dream like imagery that I cannot recall. We both sighed and cursed our luck, wondering whether this was going to be the glorious entirety of the trip. Waves of nausea, overcame us every fifteen minutes or so. This was not severe but it did diminish the pleasantness of the trip and heightened our anxiety. The sedation diminished when I walked around and I found that it was a good way to increase my energy levels. Like other hallucinogens - the HBW edginess could transmute into a sexual state.     Ronin found himself masturbating, having decided that this transmutation would be more enjoyable than anxiety. I was banished to the living room. I walked around trying to relax but found my self feeling nauseous. I wondered whether the nausea for a physicalization of a psychological state of worry. Going by my earlier ayahuasca experience I thought this could be so - it was difficult to separate the two. Both fed into a kind of vicious circle that tended to perpetuate each other. I went to the toilet and tried to vomit. I only managed to retch a few times, but felt much better thereafter. Lying down on the couch in the living room I began to to think -  \'OK. Lets not go into the usual bad trip traps of sexual or existential angst.\' I threw out my old scripts and decided to think up new ones.    I would deconstruct my psyche using my knowledge of Jungian psychology. The next few minutes were incredibly productive. I had profound insights into myself and moments of intuitively grasping all that I had read - solidly grounding the theory I had read earlier. I interpreted the anxiety as a tempermental anima, a female archetype that according to Jung resides in the psyche of all men. Characterising it as such enabled a creative emancipation that made me laugh and sigh. The world was a beautiful place again! About 2 hours had passed by this time. Lace like patterns raced across the ceiling and patterns swished around the shadows. I was enjoying introspecting so much, I didn\'t really fancy shooting the shit with Ronin.     He came out of the bedroom with a vial of Amyl Nitrite. He was clearly having a pleasurable rush. He offered me a deep whiff and I instantly felt an intense popper rush that intensified my visuals and left me ecstatic in a way that does not really happen when used by themselves. The poppers interesting changed the nature of the closed eye visuals, I was experiencing - making them more geometrical and DMT like.    An hour later we both took some Zaleplon. For those not in the know, Zaleplon by itself has interesting mildly hallucinogenic effects. It also reduces anxiety which in itself I speculated could reduce nausea. The combination worked like a charm and minutes later we felt much better. The nausea was reduced but not eliminated. Poppers were highly pleasurable and euphoric with the combination. The added tripiness of the Zaleplon worked synergistically to create a novel mind ambience that was similar to 2CB - psychedelic with an mdma like feeling of relaxation. I thought that premedication with dramamine or cinnarizine several hours prior would be a good idea next time and made a mental note. I tried to beat one out too later, just for the heck of it, but I was as useless as a rubber chicken in a brothel.     I was rudely interrupted by Ronin, who was now cribbing about how staying in the house was giving him bad vibes and how he needed to go out and try to pull women. I decided to be a dissenter and stay at home with my thoughts, but Ronin\'s pestering was seriously fucking my head up, and I wanted to get him off my back. \'What the hell\', I rationalised, \'lets do it .... all for the experience\'. I put my clothes on fighting back waves of nausea, which seemed to increase the more I stood up and walked around. We walked into the cold night air, Ronin instantly feeling better and me feeling more nauseous with every step. Screw it I thought. Lets retch and get it out. I did and felt better.    We go to a cocktail lounge/dance club near my house. Ryan is happy as can be and sets about getting himself a JD and Coke before he strutted his stuff, targeting some broads. I couldn\'t have cared less about the impressive range of ass on display. I was enveloped in a psychedelic bubble of indifference and mild disdain for the entire scene. Strangely this seemed attractive to some women there who kept trying to chat me up. Perhaps I projected a good energy. It was pretty amusing and kind of surreal - almost hallucinatory! A very attractive girl came up to me and asked me about my glasses. Ronin seized the opportunity to dance with her friend, who was very pretty. Ordinarily I would have been on her like greased lightening. At the time though I just felt slightly bemused, wanting to go home and be left alone. \'I can\'t handle this\', I thought.    Later Ronin danced with the girls for sometime, while I stood on the side, wanting desperately to leave. Ronin was in a good mood, said he experienced a nice sexual buzz on the floor - very much like mdma. He danced with the women a bit, who were friendly and receptive. I dragged him out soon enough though and we walked back home. About 7 hours had now passed but we were still tripping. We got back home and watched TV for a bit before going to sleep. I had many interesting closed eye visuals before I nodded off. They were similar to post mdma/dmt closed eye visuals. Sleep was deep and refreshing. The morning after we both experienced a sense of well being and a strange premontion that it would not be too long before we did this again."
58143,Comparing Ichiro,Dziendobry1,"Jan 20, 2010","H.B. Woodrose & Energy Blend (Guarana, Ginseng & Various)","I ordered 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for 15 bucks online.  They were the Hawaiian strain, which I figured would probably be more potent since it was where they were more expensive.  I received them pretty quickly (3 days, priority mail), and waited until I was done with finals to try them.  I decided to try them yesterday.  In preparation to reduce nausea, I only ate a small meal at 12:00pm.    At 7:30 PM last night, I took 9 seeds out of my bag.  They already had the fuzzy coating removed, and I cut each in half with a knife.  I took two dramamines before I ingested them to counter the expected nausea.  I placed 10 halves (5 seeds) in a teacup filled with water, as suggested on the web, and microwaved them for 40 seconds.  I got them out of the water, and ate them.  They were pretty chewy because of the microwave, and went down fairly easy.  The taste was bland...I think next time I\'ll put some honey in my mouth or just wash em down with pop.  I drank some of the water but I figured it was stupid.  I put 8 more halves (4 seeds) and microwaved them in water for another 40 seconds.  I ate these, drank a bit of Mountain Dew, took one more Dramamine, and sat down to chill.  When all this was said and done it was 7:45 PM.    Within 15 minutes I started to feel a bit heavy.  I was bored so I went and took a shower.  I watched TV until about 9:30.  I was pissed because nothing had happened at all yet other than the heaviness.  I didn\'t feel any nausea either, which is a telltale sign something\'s gonna happen.  My friends were over and we decided to go get something to eat.  I had decided that the seeds weren\'t working, and I was pretty mad since they cost me $15, and I\'m a poor college student.  We went to a restaurant.  I was kinda high on the seeds, in a good mood and heavy feeling, but nothing close to tripping...maybe like I\'d smoked a bowl or two.    We ordered a delicious appetizer, and I ate it right up.  I went into the bathroom, I looked fine.  Upon receiving our entrees, I decided I wasn\'t hungry at all.  I felt a little nausea, went to the bathroom, and tried to force myself to puke.  It didn\'t work, and I went and looked in the mirror, and my pupils were very dilated.  I decided I didn\'t want to stay, since I had just gotten off an MJ possession probation.  I know HBWR is legal and all, but I don\'t think I\'d wanna explain to cops why my pupils were the size of dimes.  So we left the restaurant.  That\'s when it absolutely slapped me at about 9:45, 2 hours after ingesting them.  When my friend started driving, I felt like we were going 90mph, then 10.  Every turn felt way too wide.  When my friend pulled up to the curb, I thought he was gonna go right over it and smash into my front door.    I went inside, no nausea yet.  I started watching TV and talking online, listening to a little music (which, obviously, was awesome on this substance).  My friend was flipping through channels, and there was an asian baseball player on tv.  It said like \'Comparing Ichiro,\' obviously meaning they were comparing him to someone else.  I was like, \'Comparing Ichirio?  What kind of name is Compa-ring???\'    Nausea (very bearable) finally hit me for about 10 minutes, and I threw up my delicious appetizer and mashed potatoes.  After that, the nausea was totally gone gone, and I think I plateaued.  I had been playing Warcraft III all day, and I kept seeing characters for that (closed eye).  I went in my bathroom with the lights off, and I tried to make myself see scary shit.  I did, and just laughed at it.  It was easy to distinguish reality from fantasy, and I could see anything I wanted to (closed eye).  I had a cigarette outside.  I couldn\'t feel the smoke or taste it, and I felt like I was taking huge hits when I was taking really small ones.    We started watching Peewee\'s Playhouse on Cartoon Network.  The show was very funny on this substance.  Everything was funny and I was babbling to my friend about goofy shit.  I kept twitching my arm though for some reason, and I didn\'t stop moving my legs all night.  It was apparent I was on something, so I stayed at my apartment until later.  Everything had a rhythm to it, and all the lights were bright, glowing, and warm.  My lamp has a funny pattern on it, and touching it was really neat.  I ate a pack of Gushers.  The sugar tingled my tongue, and the chewy texture plus gooey liquid was amazing in my mouth.  Try different textured foods and objects on this, it\'s fun.    I was in my room on the computer.  I got really tired, and wanted to go to bed.  However my friend was over and I figured it\'d be rude to sleep.  I put my head on my monitor.  It felt really warm...the glass right now is cool to the touch.  I could\'ve fallen asleep on it.  I went downstairs and took some Guarana (in the form of an energy pill also containing Ginseng and a few other \'energy\' herbals).  I was wide awake within 15 minutes, so I doubt it was from the pills.  Keep in mind that every minute feels like 10 on this stuff.  I tripped for about 2 hours total, but it felt like 5.    We watched some more TV, and I was having a blast.  I started to come down a bit at Midnight, so we went to the strip club.  I think it would\'ve been much more fun when I was peaking, but I was still pretty high.  The cigarettes tasted gross - I smoke Dunhills which taste more natural than most cigs (no additives).  They reminded me of the taste of the seeds, which made me feel kinda weird. So I put it out and just chilled.  Some friends of mine were there, and they had rented a big velvet couch.  So I undid my top two buttons on my shirt, and layed back, imitating Tony Montana in a coked out daze.      For the first two hours at the strip club I was pretty high.  I couldn\'t feel parts of my body.  I could\'ve pissed my pants and not known.  That area was numb, but then it got really sensitive later.  I imagine sex on these would be fun (on a lower dose).  I couldn\'t feel the Coca Cola I was drinking, but I could feel it at the same time.  I found this to be true often with this.  You could do something yet not do it at the same time.  Don\'t ask me how to explain it.  I finally came down off my high at 2 AM, and all the effects subsided around 2:30.    I ate some pizza rolls, and got a very great sleep.  I woke up at 2 PM, and I feel like a million bucks right now.  My next planned dose is 13 seeds."
54091,The Inner Adventure,Revolvmg,"Sep 16, 2009",H.B. Woodrose & Coffee,"Previous experience: Loads of alcohol & cannabis      The very first time I took HBWR seeds, I wanted to avoid the nausea.  I didn\'t eat for 6-7 hours. I removed the light-brownish husks with  nails and a knife. I chew 4 seeds for 15 minutes and then I spitted  everything out. It didn\'t work so well. In one particular moment I  felt like I was totally numb and later on I felt like I was going  to fell asleep. I also smoked some hashish because I didn\'t really  believe the seeds we\'re working. And while I was doing this I drank  couple of beers. I usually drink & smoke alot, but this time I was  so tired after all this shit I just wanted to get some sleep. I  can\'t truly tell if I was intoxicated by the seeds or not.    The next morning, I prepared for the nausea. First I removed once  again carefully the light-brownish husks from the seeds. Then I  ground up 6 seeds in 3 different cups, each holding 2 seeds.  I boiled some mineral water, let it cool down to 60 celsius and  added that into every cup. I waited for 2-3 hours for the mixtures  to cool down into room temperature. I also didn\'t eat anything for  4 hours. Just 10 minutes before I started to ingest the actual  mixture, I ate a teaspoonfull of ginger. Some people claim it  helps avoiding the nausea. The taste of ginger is not so pleasant.  It burns all the way down my throat and into my stomach.    After the \'ginger hell\' I drank 2 cups of my mixture, so I had  ingested total of 4 seeds. After 15-20 minutes, I started to feel  light-headed. I had to resist the vomiting. Ginger was still burning  and the seeds really did make me wanna throw up. I knew I had to.  Still, I resisted. It was quite difficult to relax or to walk, I  felt like I was a bit drunk and I wanted to vomit. I decided to wait  for 60 minutes, and then I would throw up if I had to. Right after  this I realized, I could control my feelings quite well. I could  sing along with some piece of music and forget the urge for vomiting.  I believed I could control these kind of feelings, I believed it was  all in my head. I carefully chose good songs to make me feel better.  And it did. I also did some things I really like, playing guitar,  singing & such. All these things made me feel even better. Then  suddenly, I remembered last night, and I recalled I had feelings  quite like this, and I enjoyed it.    The only downside, besides the urge for vomiting, was the feeling  of drowsyness... I even made some coffee just to keep me awake.  Then I wanted to drink the last cup of 2 seeds mixture I made earlier.  I drank it and went to see my friend. I still felt like I was only a bit  drunk. When I reached my friends residence, we watched a video and smoked  some cannabis. I told my friend what I had done and he didn\'t seem to care,  I felt like I had no-one to tell this.    Then, from out of nowhere, appeared a new world in front of me.  I started to realize things from a totally new perspective.  I knew I had to leave immediately. The information that kept  coming from things I did there was too much. I told my friend  I couldn\'t concentrate for what we we\'re doing because I was  somewhere else, doing something else. And then I left.    When I was walking back home, I saw a group of people who were  sitting in a bar nearby. They all arose and left the bar as soon  as I walked by. At first, I thought to myself, am I that horrible?  Then I realized they split up because they were going somewhere else.  It was the relief of my life. And as I continued walking back home,  I saw some elderly people as well, they looked at me and I swear,  I knew exactly what they were thinking. So I reacted differently,  and I saw how it affected them. I believed I could control this  situation. It was all just a matter of understanding gestures.  And those gestures had always been there for me. But only now, I could  understand those gestures so well that I could control the situation.  I was quite polite and I enjoyed it. And it made me feel good too.    When I got back home, I saw my entire life like a book. It was all  there. I just never realized it, because it didn\'t have any meaning.  By looking any object I own, I saw where it had come from, why it  was there, why I liked it and why I chose to keep it. I remembered  all the things it had been through, where was it made, who had played  with it and so on... In my everyday life, I pass by many things  I have gathered throughout my years of existence like it didn\'t  mean anything to me. Well it does. I just never stop there to  see and understand the meaning of it all. But this time I could see.  I was so overwhelmingly happy of all the objects I had received from  thousands of different sources it made me smile. It made me cherish  life itself.    Then I got an another idea. I wanted to record a video of myself  thinking these kinds of things. In case I would forget how happy I was.  It was a difficult task. I had to remind myself of what I was doing  for every 5 seconds. I just saw the camera and I remembered every little  recording the camera had ever recorded and every little detail of the  camera made me remember where it was damaged and so on... When I finally  managed to assemble it, I started recording. It was impossible to speak  those things which were inside my head. It was all too much. When I  opened my mouth and said something, my mouth froze and I was left  speechless, dreaming. Every sentence I started, ended prematurely as  my mind drifted away with the memories I encountered everywhere I gazed  upon. This is when I decided not to record anymore.    I went to my bed to lie down and enjoy. I have no idea how long I was  there, since time had no meaning at all. Or at least, I didn\'t care.  The rest of my trip I embraced life and tried to focus my thoughts  to gain understanding of life. And I did understand. The trip  was over in about 6 hours or so, and I started to feel the after  effects. I called my friend to come see me and apologized why  I was so rude earlier. He said he understanded why I did it, and  I understanded it too. We smoked some pot, watched some videos and  had a great time. Afterwards we just fell asleep.      Conclusion:  At the first time, I didn\'t take enough seeds and my technique was  totally incorrect. The next time I drank the seed mixtures I was  successful and had just the right amount. I had some slight visuals  too, not worth mentioning though. The inner adventure I had was so  much more. I still feel happy about my journey, and I believe my  journey was successful because my timing was right. My life was so  perfect at the time it reflected my trip very pleasantly. Also I would  like to point out the side-effects I had, the terrible nausea at first  and the hangover which included \'foggy\' mind, thirst and numb legs.  Still, it was the price to pay and I will certainly do this again."
75840,Amazing - Intense Visuals And Awareness,Kellas,"Sep 16, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"Note: Bought 50 seeds from a trusted source, did not ingest food for 5 hours prior.   [Erowid Note:  The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid\'s \'heavy\' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    Well I had a night with nothing planned and only one appointment the next day so I figured I\'d try them out. Started out with 5 seeds, chewing for about 5-7 minutes before swallowing. Then I moved on to 8 seeds and then I took the rest, chewing them the same way. For the first half an hour there wasn\'t much of a feeling, maybe a little buzz that felt like drinking one or two beers. Another thirty minutes after that and I started to feel giggly. Everything seemed more entertaining and simple tasks seemed infinitely more interesting.  In another 30-40 minutes I started to have hot and cold rushes, I also felt fully aware of my surroundings and I was getting very light visuals. I was talking with a friend and I kept licking my lips and feeling all of the hair on my upper lip, at one point I really had a craving to lick my dogs eye (haha yeah). After 10 more minutes had past I start getting more intense visuals, my friend was morphing between Lucy Liu, Elvis, and John Lennon. In addition to this when I went to the washroom and looked in the mirror I turned into a snowman for about 5 minutes and this caused me to freak out a little so I started splashing water on my face. Doing this seemed to cause the snow to melt away (lol) and I was underneath. After staring at myself for another moment I started to morph. I would get taller and more fit, shorter and larger, etc. Eventually I just left the washroom because it was freaking me out a bit and I couldn\'t remember what I looked like so I just left the washroom to go back with my friend.  At this point I wasn\'t sure what to do, I wanted to do something fun that would maybe intensify the visuals but I just ended up talking with my friend for an hour while he morphed around into celebrities. Eventually the effects were calming down a little (effects started at 9:30pm, didn\'t calm down until about 2:00am) and he decided to go home. When he left I went to put on a hoodie because I was cold and spent 20 minutes trying to put the damn thing on before I gave up. So feeling a little cold I decided to walk around the house and all of a sudden I started to remember all sorts of things from my childhood, it\'s like they were flowing into my head (the memories) and I couldn\'t stop them. And not just a normal \'oh yeah I remember that.. her name was so-and-so right?\', I could clearly see the memories, it was almost as if I teleported back in time and was re-living them. It was very intense and made me analyze my life so far. Really made me think about certain choices I\'ve made.  After the memories started to fade I really wanted to get some sleep so I didn\'t miss the appointment in the morning so I just spent 20 minutes getting ready for bed (all I had to do was change and pull the covers up but that seemed impossible at the time), once that was done I hopped in bed and the room started spinning and I was thrown into the sky with fluffy sheep, clouds and beds floating around. I had this huge smile on my face and I thought this was the best thing I had ever seen and I felt so warm and comfortable. After a few moments I actually drifted off to sleep however (just a note, bedtime was about 3:30am).  In the morning when I woke up my head felt like there was mild pressure on it. It was a little uncomfortable but not as bad as a regular headache. In addition to this my pupils were dilated and I was quite sensitive to light.   Overall I felt this was a great experience. I saw new things, I was able to reflect on past choices and experiences and overall I feel I learned something from this. I haven\'t taken them again since but maybe soon when I have some free time or more reflecting to do."
61826,Seeing the Masculine,IllinoisAdultMale,"Sep 12, 2009",H.B. Woodrose,"Retrospective, took 6 seeds crushed with rock in yogurt also crushed up 6 seeds and smoked them. Very positive experience noticed how I always have to fit into world in some way. As a male I felt I was getting too feminine and should care and honor more of what other guys say and care less about what girls have to say. Upon doing this I gradually noticed a change in perception and a deepening of my voice and sexuality. Started swearing more felt more that god was male, Honored my father over mother, ect. Felt more that it was ok to do chemicals since its a male thing to do ect.     Later next day took 10 seeds thought about job and future career. Need to get one. Affects seemed diminished since I had previously took them day earlier. Next day took 10 more followed by 18 following day. Noticed drowsyness come over me, followed by new creative insights. Social aspects talked with parents hung out with dog, more so than usual. No one suspected anything. Felt very powerful as if I could fight well or rip a tree from ground, very masculine, noticed fellow males were largely feminine, drawn to a different type of male on this. Listened to eminem, liked his attitude. Would recommend this plant a legal herb that does something Possibly mystical at incredibly high doses but it felt more like an add pill for me. Im a big guy 190 lbs and 24yrs old. Its a dont push me around, men own the universe women should play their part in it, the balance is needed everything is termporarly. Perfect experience.    Negative include nausea the seeds do not sit well or taste delicious. Tiredness. Positives would include increased sex drive, I wasnt around any females at the time, touch would have felt awesome, very in control feeling, past experiences I actually broke down crying in mystical fashion at how beautifully the universe was set up and how it was ok to surrender and trust in it as a guide, mushy stuff like that. Overall recommended. Tolerance builds up fast and it doesnt seem like it would."
56493,Psychadelic Smoothie,Briconz,"Jun 4, 2009",H. B. Woodrose,"This is my 12th time using hawaiian baby woodrose. Previous trips were successful once i surpassed the come-up nausea stage. I decided to try to find a different way of doing it this time.    My previous experience with drugs is quite vast. Any painkiller you can think of from vicodin to morphine pills, research chemicals 2c-i on about 30 occasions, 2c-e a dozen, mdma on more than i can remember occasions, all sorts of smokeables like weed, salvia extracts, other legal herbs (which did nothing for me), opium, and of course psychadelics such as mushrooms and lsd on many occasions.    Now that you know a little about where i\'m coming from, let me begin. I often find the nausea and coming up on hbwr to be very distracting and a pretty big mountain to climb to get to the enjoyable part of the trip. I\'ve tried crushing them and eating them straight, putting them in a glass of water and chugging, putting them in gelcaps and swallowing and none of these really cancelled out the nausea for me. I decided to try grain alcohol as a vehicle for my lysergic acid amides.    Preperation:    I crushed up a dozen seeds, handpicked out of a pile of about 150, with pliers and further crushed them with a flat surface to some pretty fine chunks. I then placed them in 2 or so shots of ice cold grain alcohol and let it sit for 4 days in a dark place.    The Trip:    I wanted to have a good mindset, so i had a few drinks to get my head in the right mood. I prepared a bowl for later and tucked it away in my desk. I grabbed my potion i made earlier and brought it to my blender. I made a strawberry daiquiri (minus any alcohol) to use as the other half of my vehicle. I put a paper towl over the bottle (to keep seed mush out) and poured it into the blender with the daiquiri i just prepared, mmm fresh strawberries. I figured the healthyness of the fruit might add to the enjoyment. I added a shot of cold fresh grain alcohol to the bottle where the seed mush was to try to get out anything left over, and once again strained it through a paper towel into the blender. I whipped it out real quick and then poured it out. Down the hatch it went. I drank it over the course of 15 minutes, it was delicious and the flavor of the hbwr actually gave it a very unique, but tasty flavor.    The come up was relatively smooth, i began to feel the effects in about 30 minutes, i believe this is due to the grain alcohol infused with lsa\'s having a faster absorption than seeds alone. The human body does not break down plant material well at all, so i figured this would be a better way to get the most out of my seeds.    After an hour i was feeling very groovy and very euphoric. My visual field was enhanced and i felt very comfortable with my surroundings. My friends decided to smoke so i said sure, i\'d love to. A good session ensued where a few bowls were passed around, including the one i packed earlier. Total, i\'d say i smoked about a bowl\'s worth myself.    After this, about an hour and 45 minutes into it, i was feeling very groovy. It\'s amazing how the alcohol extracts all the goodness out of the seeds, leaving behind all the unwanted chemicals. I had no sense of nausea at all by the way, at anytime.  About 3 hours into it was my peak. If i was standing or sitting still i was getting lsd and mushroom like breathing walls. It was very pleasent to see and made me very happy. Getting up and walking around was even more enjoyable. I played some grateful dead and danced around singing for a good portion of time, extremely elated.    4 hours into it, i recieved a call from a girl i know, we\'ll call her K, so she stopped by. She was rather intoxicated so i was pleased to see her as much as she was to see me. My friends, her and myself hung out in the living room watching some ridiculous show (Next) on mtv. K was laying on me and it felt great to feel any body contact. My physical senses were greatly enhanced but i feel that having sex would have been out of the question because my mind was too distracted.    After about 6 hours, about 2am at this point, everyone departed and i was starting to become drowsy. Hbwr has this effect on me when i come down, but then again it was 2am so maybe it was time for bed. I would have loved to keep dancing but the energy was not there. That is what i love about mdma, it is energy and euphoria in one easy to swallow form. Mmm... So at around 230 i drifted off to sleep, had some very vivid dreams and woke up very refreshed. Had a cup of coffee and some toast and i was ready to go, feeling very clean and renewed.    Conclusion:    This trip is more or less a preperation recipe. Using cold strong alcohol seemed to extract the most out of the seeds. I kept it away from any heat at all times. The smoothie/daiquiri was a very easy to swallow vehicle for the hbwr which can usually be very disgusting to stomach. The nausea was non-existent but that might have been due to the fact i had a few drinks before and the marijuana i smoked. Overall, this preperation and method was very successful and i would recommend this method to anyone wanting to try hbwr but fears the nausea will be too much."
78924,Migraine Away,Remember,"May 23, 2009","Rivea corymbosa, H.B. Woodrose & Migraines","I have suffered from migraine headaches (light sensitivity, light pulsing across vision, pain, vision loss) since I was an adolescent. Nothing has ever worked, NOTHING. I\'ve had debilitating 36 hour bouts with these headaches.    Now I take 3-5 of the seeds when I perceive an onset (or during) and away it goes. Now after 2 years, on ocassion 3 might not do, so I take one HB woodrose in addition to 3 and GONE! The side effect is clearer thoughts, creativity, and a sense of well being.    That has been my experience and I hope it can help you too. Lastly I hear LSD is good for cluster headaches (migraines) so I guess it stands that pre threshold amounts of LSA work too. I\'ve never had the LSD."

Woodrose & Salvia divinorum (10x extract),"I\'m more an alcohol than a drug person, and have never really done anything more potent than weed and absinthe. But with my parents being away I thought I\'d order some HBW and some 10x and 15x salvia divinorum. I\'m not sure whether it was a combination of chemicals, reading bad reports online or my own sub-conscious that triggered the bad part of this trip, but after ingesting 4 crushed seeds at about 4pm I felt great. Relaxed and happy, the mild trip was uneventful, but unfortunately left me unprepared for the nightmare I was about to face.     In a flash of misguided inspiration, I thought to myself \'Yes, I\'m going for the Salvia\'. The HBW had made me let my guard down, my promise to myself to get a sitter out of the window. So I loaded the pipe sat down and took a toke of the 10x. It happened in stages.    1. Things around started to appear to have a 2 dimensional, cardboard quality. The pictures on the TV, the TV itself, the room itself essentially became a TV screen.     2. I looked at my hand - it appeared fused - but to nothing in particular. If I was a spiritual person I guess I\'d say to time and space or the universe or something but at the time I just thought it looked damn cool.    3. I became aware my lighter I was holding felt like a living organic part of me. An extra finger, perhaps, and I recognised and tried to remember this feeling from my past. A mistake maybe, because this is when it started to go downhill.    4. It was as if the drug had gone up about a dozen gears without me noticing. I suddenly felt trapped, lost and confused and began to panic.     5. I forgot I had taken the drug.    6. I honestly felt like I was the only thing that existed, as if I was a one dimensional creature, living in some strange blackness or void, despite still seeing distorted versions of everything around me. My heart was racing, I was terrified. I thought I would be in this place forever. I felt like a body without a mind.     7. This is the most disturbing part of the experience. Some part of me was trying to convince myself that everything was OK, I was only tripping, it would be over soon. I looked down at my pipe, and kept mumbling \'drug\' over and over again, but like everything around me, the word meant nothing to me.    8. I couldn\'t move, I tried to focus but nothing seemed real to me. Total disconnection from everything and everyone, and absolutely no idea why. I was still trying to console myself but all words and thoughts became a nihilistic tangle in my mind. The only emotion I was feeling was a deep sense of dread and fear.     9. That was when I appeared to snap out of it. I got ran to the bathroom, shaking and sweating all over, tearing at my clothes. \'Drug, drug, drug, its only a drug\' I recall saying before sticking my fingers down my throat and collapsing on the tiles. I remember literally hugging the floor, feeling its coolness, just glad to be back from the strange place I had managed to escape from.     I guess that about sums up the Salvia trip. I was still a little shaken and the Saliva appeared to have an adverse affect on the HBW \'trip\' I was still having. I was shaken and paranoid. I couldn\'t sleep because every time and started to breathe evenly, I felt I had stopped and felt the need to take a deep breath.    Now the following morning I am still not sure about the whole thing. Was it as bad as I thought? What triggered it? Will I ever try it again, or have I been scared for life? It will be interesting to see how long this feeling lasts."
75377,1 Seed Dose,Swim,"Dec 1, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"I was looking furiously for some information on the internet about the effects at certain doses of the LSA containing Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, which will here after be referred to as HBW for simplicity. After fruitless hours of searching, I decided to take it into my own hands to create these reviews. This particular review will serve as a walkthrough on a dose of a single HBW seed.    Preperation: The seed was scraped of its fuzzy outer coating as suggested by many of a resource. Then, the seed was crushed and placed in a bottle with 3 ounces of water. The mixture sat, for 1 hour, and shaken occasionally.    Note: I had a slight stomach ache prior and at the time of ingestion. Nothing to make life too uncomforatable, just noticeable.    (T+0:00) The HBW/water mixture is ingested without filtration of the substances to reduce the risk of losing any of the active ingredients that may be in the seeds. Normally I would have filtered the material out, but decided against it because of the small doseage. Tastes like chewing on dirt and leaves, or any other organic material. Slightly unpleasant. Washed the taste down with an orange soda. Will place in something more tasty next time    (T+0:20)  I am feeling slightly light headed. I am not sure if this is in my head. But the experience is pleasant.    (T+1:00)  I am feeling nothing from the one dose of HBW. Colors are slightly more vivd, but barely noticeable.    (T+4:00) I can now conclude, at least for me, that a single HBW seed does very little. Colors were slightly more vibrant. I am sure that this was not a mind game. It was slight, and if this were all I could get, it would not be worth the trouble.    I will continue with my research and plan on attempting a 2 seed dose soon, prepared in the same manner."
44595,"Body Buzz, Mania, then Endless Thoughts",DeltaHeavy,"Sep 16, 2008",H.B. Woodrose & Meclizine (Dramamine 2),"Preparation method: Weighed the six seeds and then crushed them in a Ziploc bag with a hammer and put the crushed contents into an empty 000 gelatin capsule and swallowed with one Meclizine HCl 25 mg tablet to (hopefully) prevent nausea. My good friend D will be joining me on our first psychedelic trip on this hot summer Saturday afternoon. We both have about the same body weight and dosage. Notes preceded with D are written by my friend.     1:30 PM (T+ 0:00) We each swallow our capsule with water, having only eaten a small breakfast earlier in the day. I also remembered to take an Allegra for my seasonal allergies.    (T+ 0:30) I am starting to feel as if I drank one or two alcoholic drinks: I have a slight body buzz. D said he sees flashing lights in his peripheral vision which is somewhat annoying. The patterned ceiling looked pretty cool to him. He is having visual effects while I am not.     2:30 (T+ 1:00) I definitely have a +1 (PiKHAL) effect now. The biggest effect is a pleasant body buzz. I pinched myself and I feel the pain but have little reaction to it. Colors seem to be more noticeable. They are not particularly more colorful; its just that I am noticing them more now. At this point, I have no nausea but my stomach feels a bit bloated, like I need to burp but cannot. If I swallow air and then burp the feeling gets better but it is still there. My friend also says he feels nauseous but cannot throw up. The nausea is overpowering. He is sitting near the toilet with the lights off and smiled when I walked in to see if he was okay.    3:00 PM (T+ 1:30) We decided to walk to the pharmacy to look for some ipecac syrup to help D so he can throw up. When we got there he felt better, not sure if it was exercise, heat, or time that reduced his nausea, but we still ask for some just in case. They dont have any. We get some ice cream and head home. Physical movement requires more mental effort than normal. He later said the nausea was still present, but other effects became more noticeable and he was able to ignore the nausea.    4:17 PM (T+ 2:47) Back home now. I really feel like listening to that song with the lyrics Strange, strange world on my Satoshie Tomiie CD2 Track 9, so I put it on. This feels like being drunk and silly. I am slow at typing. Everything with movement of the body takes a lot of effort, including typing.     4:30 PM (T+ 3:00) I looked in the mirror and pupils are dilated like when one takes MDMA. Natural light seems harsh. I closed the blinds and turned on some soft lights.    4:38 PM (T+ 3:08) I seem to get stuck in whatever mental state I want to be in. If I say Im tired, I feel tired. If I want energy, I can get up and dance to the music and enjoy that too. I am very impatient and my attention span is very short!    D - 4:40PM (T+ 3:10) We need preparation!!! But we cant prepare because we dont know what we want till we want it! And once we want it we need it or we wont want it.    D - 4:50PM (T+ 3:20) I want to write but I dont want to because as soon as I start doing one thing I know I am missing out on what else I could be doing. Its too hard to commit to one activity knowing that if I start to do that. I will be missing the opportunity to do what else there is and the experience will be over before I get everything out of my head that I wanted to. This paragraph was recorded in less than a minute though I could swear it took an eternity. Es note  Time distortion is variable. Sometimes time goes by slowly and sometime time goes by quickly.    D - 4:53PM (T+ 3:23) The clock must have feelings and know when we want to savor this moment so it will slow for us, when the experience changes to, not unpleasant, but not the same euphoria time will pass much more quickly to get you to the next happy place.    4:56PM (T+ 3:26) Totally a good thing, +2 (PiKHAL)    D  4:57PM (T+ 3:27) I lost my thought. My mind is like a switch, whatever I want to do or enjoy, I just have to decide thats what I want to do and turn on the switch.    5:04PM (T+ 3:34) Time in my mind is long. Real time is short. Thoughts were going through my head at a rapid pace.    D  5:14PM (T+ 3:44) It\'s not that thought is lost, it\'s that I cant express what I want before it\'s gone, it\'s all up there I just need more than 1 trip through time to experience every part of what I want. E thinks I want a +3 instead of a +2 which weve decided this to be. So I cant decide and the trip just takes me to that place I want to be, or if it decides to take me to another path I will have to be along for the ride    5:30 PM (T+ 4:00) At this point, neither of us could decide what we wanted to do. We end up lying in the living room silently thinking, eyes closed. Thoughts came and went, sometimes enjoyable, other times, slightly uncomfortable. The music was enjoyable. I had a hard time getting comfortable and I remember feeling hungry but not wanting to eat. My nose was also stuffy. I didnt want to move around. I did not sleep for some hours. I stopped keeping track of time. I remember wanting to be back at baseline so I can make more sense of all these thoughts, most of which are later forgotten. Slowly the effects became less intense and I end up falling into a dreamlike state or sleeping.    9:30 (T+ 8:00) I woke up for a bit. Im back to a +1. I get up to eat a granola bar and drink some water because I was hungry and thirsty but did not feel like preparing any food. It is mostly tasteless but I can feel the texture. My mouth is very dry, possibly dehydration? I drink some water.     11:00 (T+ 9:30) Near baseline with some lingering after effects. D has gone home; his shoes and car are gone and the door locked. This experience has been interesting but not entirely what I expected or hoped for. We both sat in our own worlds thinking about stuff. I am hungry. Food tastes normal now and I feel restless.     I know I didnt come up with anything profound and I don\'t remember most of the thoughts I had. I woke up the next day feeling rested and completely normal. I\'m not sure if I will repeat the HBW experience but it was an interesting introduction to the psychedelic world."
64575,Why I\'m Still Alive,Thanos9760,"Sep 3, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"I wrote most of this report as it happened. Alot of it had to do with the Star Wars game I was playing at the time. I will pare that part away for usability.    T-0. Seeds arrive. I scrape the hulls of 4 seeds and eat them, chewing well. I scrape due to reports of nausea causing compounds in the hulls. I believe this false, I think they\'re in the seeds themselves, but why take the chance? I only eat 4 seeds, because although I consider myself a high ranking tripper and veteran of the psychic wars, most of my experience is decades behind me. I no longer drink (alcoholic), don\'t smoke pot, (paranoia, and drug tests at work). Basically a LSA experience only.    My mood is good, the setting is good. I am alone, and my wife, who does not get high anymore, has reluctantly agreed to my eating these seeds. I wish we could do this together, and hope she doesn\'t give me a bad trip. There are no stupid people around, except for me. HAH! All is good. I am now anxiously awaiting another peak into the doorway of innerspace yet again. Who and what will I find there? What will I learn, and how will I handle the powerful Juju now coursing it\'s way to my synapses? Will I be OK, or will the potent psychedelic leave me babbling incoherently, wandering the planes of existence outside our own forevermore?     11:20 Nothing yet. Feeling lightheaded, but surmise this a placebo effect and result of expectation. T.V. annoying. Turning it off.    11:30 Strangely lightheaded now. Minor difficulty writing, not bad. Stomach churning? Can\'t tell. I am wary. Pupils now dialated. Vaguely LSD-like feeling down my spine. Light from the blinds irritating. Shit! It\'s on, now. My puppy (not a hallucination) is chewing on an electrical cord. I yell at him, and then feel very bad. I tell him I love him and it\'s OK. I somehow feel that an electrocuted puppy just now could possibly be detrimental to my trip.    Absolutely now doubt now. Penmanship bad. Can\'t remember how to spell, concentration, no bueno. Stomach good. Head good. Plan proceeding along expected parameters. I have been playing a very colorful Star Wars game, and suddenly realize that if I don\'t dispatch this upstart rebel force soon, I will be front and center on the command bridge of an Imperial Star Destroyer, TRIPPING BALLS. Somehow I find that amusing, and grin. Pressure in head growing. Dog sleeping at my feet, I feel much empathy for this creature who trusts and depends on me. Trying to finish the game, but I have climbed aboard the trippin\' train, and it has left the station with me aboard. I cannot escape - I must embrace the forces upon me.    12:30 I think I am feeling the full effects of the seeds (turns out, NOT). Stomach not so good. Need to lay down.    3PM awoke (was I sleeping?) from powerful visions and wild psychedelia. Breakthrough revelation - I must take care of my wife, that\'s why I\'m still alive (writers note, I was a junkie on the streets for many years, and have wondered why I am still alive, consider it a miracle). I must be a better husband. Stop listening to negative headbanging music. Get up and do what Pam wants to do more often, don\'t worry about yourself so much. CEVs more powerful than expected. Truth learned: the dog\'s life is important and tied now to ours. Nothing more to learn except salvia is like a foriegn invader, not a good psychedlic.    4Pm eyes wet - must have been crying, reason unknown. 4 seeds very powerful. Now wishing wife would come home to help me - holy shit stomach bad now.    That is the end of my real time journal, and I apologize for the strange writing, but, hey, I was tripping. After that I wanted to call my wife to tell her to come home (she was in a meeting with some company big shots) but high as I was, I had enough sense to not interupt that meeting to tell her I was bugging out. She came home, gave me 10 mg of valium, which helped tremendously, and sat with me for the rest of the night. She was very kind, and made the trip OK. It easily could have gone the other way, had she been a bitch, but that\'s why I married her. I started to come down good about 8 PM, but was sick to my stomach for a good while. Hurled a couple times, but nothing unexpected. Took some pepto, that helped. I got no real sleep that night, and struggled at work the next day, just tired, and slightly confused. Didn\'t want to call in sick, \'Cuz, after all, veterans are expected to hold their shit together, right? I had some very powerful revelations, just crystal clear."
52183,20 Hour Trip,HCTSun,"Aug 24, 2008","Salvia Divinorum (20x extract), H.B. Woodrose Seeds & Cannabis","I have tripped before with mushrooms, LSD, and weed and have had good experiences except for one bad trip with ingested weed. I was very excited to have my first salvia trip.    Early in the morning around 10am I sat down on a dark room and smoke it, nothing, smoke it again and then the room started to tilt towards the right and I felt very uncomfortable, the salvia made me very hungry and dizzy and since I was looking forward for extreme hallucinations I was disappointed. I also felt very hungry so I walked very heavily to the kitchen, my legs felt very heavy and I couldn\'t believe that I failed at the salvia experience. I had cereal but couldn\'t even find milk so I had to eat it with yogurt.    I went back to the room to give this another try so I filled the pipe once more and inhaled and held the smoke for as long as I could and then I coughed and as I laid down I kept coughing, or so I though because I think that I was only dreaming that I was coughing, and coughing and then I started to hear voices and felt how cold the room was and it was then that the experience became terrifying. I was looking at some strange honeybee nest patterns that extended from the wall all the way close to my eyes. I kept coughing and then I realized that I was holding the lighter and slowly leaning down. I felt very empty. I felt that I was in hell because I couldn\'t feel my body. I felt dead.    I was heartbroken with the experience since I didn\'t go to a wonderful world. I was expecting to explore my dreams with full consciousness but it didn\'t happen. Instead I was simply terrified and very uneasy and since I felt empty and dead I just wanted to eat or do something that would make me feel alive. Shortly afterwards I joined my sister and her friend while they were smoking weed and tell them about the experience and how it sucked and how I missed the ganja and the pleasant feeling of joy and happiness that I just didn\'t have then. This is when the Woodrose seeds come in: Since I was disappointed with the salvia trip and seriously thought it was a bad idea to keep smoking salvia I decided I should try these seeds I just got and had never tried. So I start eating them while we are talking and eating MORE SUGAR, that is, chocolate cake. I gave them three seeds but I ate seven! I didn\'t clean them or anything I just chewed them.    20 minutes later I felt very drugged, but not trippy drugged rather I felt sedated and very nauseous so I just laid down and moaned. They just stared at me and went outside to smoke some more weed. I kept moaning and told them kidding that I felt that I was going to die. My sister scolded me for trying to trip just after the bad trip I had with salvia. I was so uneasy and felt so dirty so I took a bath and while I was taking the bath I remembered I was still high with salvia and started to puke. I felt very good afterwards. I join them once again and after they woke up from their naps at around 11:30 am we talk about how the seeds are kicking in and how we all feel extremely high and even drunk. We had a great time and it was then that I joined them and smoked marijuana.    I felt a rush. I had not smoked in more than two months and I felt so high. In fact, I don\'t remember even feeling this type of high. The trip had fractal visuals included. We stared at the clouds for about 6 hours that day and concrete was our comfortable bed on three different locations. Its all blurry but I remember we just changed location once in a while and ended up laying on the floor while looking either at the floor itself, snails that we caught, or the clouds and their movements. The trip was so intense that right now I have hyperopia and can barely type and its 7:33 am.    One can only imagine the feelings of emptiness that these drugs made me feel and it is only now that I feel that I am coming down from the trip. I felt highly tempted to try salvia once more but rejected the idea and instead logged on to the internet to read more experiences.    Summary of the HBWS + weed after salvia with some caffeine and lots of sugar:    Lots of energy yet no muscle strength to use it.  Body doesn\'t feel pain yet strong feelings of nausea.  Strong visuals but no enlightenment associated with them.  Visuals can be controlled to a certain extent yet not the mood or thought itself, as was possible with mushrooms.  Feelings of a nightmarish world with salvia.  Almost impossible to talk to friends who were not themselves drugged with the seeds.  No spirals as with LSD.  No colors as with LSD.  Music had a stronger emotional effect but no visuals associated with it.  Dried mucosa and no saliva. (it was very, very, very hard to eat)  Steppenwolf type of introspection confusion feelings. (Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse)    It is important to mention that even while parts of this trip were very scary because of the thoughts of conflict that attacked me from within they were not as near horrifying as a ganja overdose. I highly recommend the woodrose seeds because they have extreme potential for visuals. I do not recommend salvia. At least not 20x. Specially if you are hoping for a joyful happy experience. Salvia just brought out the worse in me as opposed to LSD which brought intense happiness and pleasure."
26849,Was I Delusional?,Artiststranger,"Jun 17, 2008",H. B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Not too long ago me my GF and 3 other people journeyed out to the woods of a nearby park to expirience the effects of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.  For me it was my second expirience with this substance, so it was for my GF, however other 3 people expirienced it for a first time.     This time I decided to ingest 2 seeds more than last time.  So for me it was 14, my GF was 12, and other 3 people all ingested 11 seeds. From the first expirience I knew that I get sick for about an hour and a half and then smoking a little cannabis cures the problem fairly well. This was a different batch of seeds from a different supplier and the difference in effects was so tremendous that first and second times could be hardly compared.    We ingested the seeds at about 7:30-8pm on our walk to the park. It was getting dark and was a little cloudy. When we got to the park I could feel little uneasy feeling in my stomach and could say that my perception of reality was slowly changing. About an hour later we figured it was a good time to smoke a J. of cannabis prerolled a little before. It went around a couple of times and when it was done I started feeling the effects of HBW come on.    When we just started smoking that J, we saw a big moon come up over the lake so we decided to walk closer to the water that seemed really still. We stood by the water for a little bit and saw a glow bugs that seemed to be on the ground by water. They were not the flying kind but the bug kind that crawls. I picked up a leaf with one of them and it was very cool looking bug that kept shining just a little bit every few seconds.  After a couple of minutes of looking at it we decided to leave it alone and walk back to the original place we were sitting at. The walk back that was about 1 minute long, seemed much longer, it almost seemed that were were walking on one of those trademills that rotate under your feet, and you could step all you want but will not get anywhere.    We were back. I lit the candle that I found on the way to the park, one of the people lit the incence and the place we were occupying got filled with a nice aroma. The effects were coming in stronger and stronger. It was getting kind of hard to see around you since everything kind of blended in one mix of fractal patterns. At some point I noted that the last batch of seeds were not nearly so visual. And we didn\'t even get really sick this time. I had a feeling that I just wanted to lay on the ground and watch the sky. It was euphoric, pleasant, but at times scarily overtaking. I felt as I wanted to plunge into my self, into deep realms of my psyche and perhaps the psyche of all, but I couldn\'t let go of reality enough to do that.     At one point I layed on the ground and looked into the sky directly above me.  All over sudden I noticed that the outline of the trees around the patch of skies was making a shape of a almost perfect heart and the sky with a few stars in the middle of it looked beautiful. I called my GF over and told her that I had something for her. I told her to lay down and follow my hand, as I outlined the heart shaped line of the woods. She exclaimed, \'Holy Shit\' and started laughing. At the time I was feeling this love and peace which I wanted to share with other people of the group. I told one of the guys to check it out, but when I layed on the grass in the different spot I realized that the vantage point was so different that it didn\'t look anything like a heart, I tried doing the outline, and the kid answered \'Uhuh, Looks like ameoba.\'     That gave me weird uneasy feeling for a second and felt kind of stupid, I realized that it was pointless to try share something like that. And I felt awkward. I got up and moved back by my GF, and then got up and sat on the picnic table. One of my friends broke out a bunch of little glow sticks and threw a bunch of them into the air, they flew like fireworks leaving behind them amazing trails and landed on the ground. Looking at one of them from the distance of about five feet there was an aura of color around them I would say 1/2-1/1 feet wide.     I layed down on the picnic table and tried to go inside of my conciousness. About later 2 minutes in I heard a car driving by (or so it seemed) which immediately sent me into panic, considering the park is supposed to be closed at night. I jumped up and said that we have to move from the spot. I realized that the car was not really there, but the sudden call on my part was so strong that after all we decided to change locations at least for a little bit.     We decided to walk by the torn down old stone house that was not too far away. As we started walking down the trail I realized that visual distortions were worse than I thought. People were carrying glowsticks, that was making it almost impossible to adjust to the darkness and see around me or under my feet. We realized that the glowsticks were making it so hard to see we put them away and walked toward the house.    At this point I could say that this was probably most psychedelic and altered state that I have ever expirienced. I felt euphoric, but at the same time there was some kind of anxiety among/about the people I was with. I felt somewhat lost, feeling some kind of strange negative vibe that I could not quite figure out. We sat inside of the house for a while, and it was a strange expirience at least for me. I felt somewhat worried about some members of the party and kept catching a weird negative feelings that were floating around. I could exactly tell who they were coming from and why.     Soon we decided to leave the house and walk back to the grass, because we were feeling incapacitated and the old spot was much better for lying down since there was nice patch of grass. We started walking back to picnic table and on the way on of the people threw up an orange that he ate  just a little bit before. My GF stopped and was worried, but I knew that he was going to be fine. After he was done he stated that it was rather interesting expirience and it made him feel better. I thought it would.     At this point I kept getting confused and catching the pieces of verbal thought that were traveling in the air. Two of the people kept talking, and I kept getting that they were talking in a negative way about me. I couldn\'t judge how true it was so I chose to ignore everything and play stupid. I don\'t know if it was wise decision but since communicating was so difficult, there is not much I could do. I kept hearing their encoded sentences that seemed to make out things like this:    \'I can\'t understand if he is stupid or he plays a role and pretends to be one kind of like hamlet\'    \'But there is something else behind him.\'    \'Yeah, but there are different circumstances... he is different... his history...his past...\'    I felt misinterpreted and misunderstood, inadequate and somewhat upset. I felt as if I was treated with disrespect. I saw it as people that I was trying to count and see as my brothers were treating me as inferior or inadequate person. At the same time I couldn\'t judge if it was real or just. Perhaps it was and I deserved what I got. Despite the negative feelings I decided to ignore them as inexistent and confusion. But I still had tension in my chest. Everybody decided to walk back, I started getting anxiety because I don\'t like to be in civilization while so fucked up. However my friend calmed me down even not in the nicest way, and I felt better. And later my GF reinforced my feeling.    I always knew that I could rely on her. She knows what to say to make me feel better and I sometimes feel like we are two sides of the same coin. As we walked out toward civilization I felt better little by little. We walked across college campus and ended up in these peoples appt. I sat down and finally relaxed. I still had that weird negative vibe feeling, as I was judged and almost looked down or laughed at and that made me feel uncomfortable, even though the setting was comfortable. Somehow I kept getting the feeling that my presense was unwanted and I was expected to leave, and at the same time there was a feeling that this was a test. I just went with the flow and even though I felt awkward I sat on the couch, and the layed on the floor.     People put in a episode of simpsons and I was getting this delusional feeling that this Simpsons episode was supposed to carry some kind of strange sublime meaning that I just couldn\'t get. It happened to me before that I got delusional like that and it usually gives me feeling anxiety and paranoya. I wanted to leave this appt. so soon me and my GF did. I said peace to everybody and we left. We went back to my GF\'s place which was empty, I rolled a jay and we smoked and relaxed. I felt all shaken up on the inside as I always do when I feel delusional.    Overall I had a great expirience, of tremendous intesity that I am still trying to understand. Along with unwanted and overwhelming feelings there were revelations, and feelings of beauty euphoria and sometimes total understanding of being. But in the next few moments while mixing with reality and attempting to communicate it would get transformed to confusion. Was I really delusional or not I do not know. Perhaps I will ask the people that I was with if any of what I felt and thought was real. However I do not know if there is any chance that I could uncover the truth or weather anybody would want to reveal it.      It was very powerful educating expirience. And never the less that those people at times acted as jerks I am very thankful to them, because in the end they pulled me out of something that had a potential of taking my roof off. In this expirience I surrendered my rights as host or a leader and let my self be led by something else, which I am still trying to figure out."
40566,The Wonders of the Dinner Table,ZachM,"May 21, 2008",H. B. Woodrose,"After months of careful research, I decided that HBWR seeds were worth a shot. The only hallucinogens I had ever tried before these powerful seeds were mushrooms, of which I had previously only taken a gram or so. A few years later, I have now eaten many 8ths of mushrooms, and many HBWR seeds, and I have to say that the seeds definately stack up to good shrooms. This report, however, is going to detail my very first experience with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds.    At 3:30 p.m. I was about to leave my mom\'s house, after visiting with my brother Josh, when he pulled out a small bag of something. He said that they were HBWR and that he had gotten them off a dude at work, and that he had tripped off of them the previous day. I immediately told him to give me a few, and he gave me the rest of the bag, 11 seeds. I then proceeded to chew them up well, and then I left, telling Josh that I would call him when they started to kick in.    It was a half hour drive back to my dad\'s house, and the only noticeable affect of the seeds was slight nausea, which passed almost by the time I got home. I decided to watch some tv and let some time pass to allow the seeds to kick in.    A few hours went by, and at 6:00 p.m. I was still not really feeling anything but a slight sense of fatigue. I was actually kind of pissed because I thought the seeds were duds. At 6:30, my dad walked into the room and began talking to me. I believe he said something along the lines of \'Dinner\'s gonna be ready in an hour or so, why don\'t you go mow the lawn?\'. I looked away from him, towards the floor, and all of a sudden, something didn\'t feel right. I tried to say something to him, but all that would come out was a slurred \'...ok...\' He left the room, and my heart started racing as a I noticed that the grey and black speckles on the burbur carpeting began to jump around a little. They just wouldn\'t hold still. Then, my dad threw one of my little brother\'s toys into the room, and where it hit the carpet, a ripple effect began. It was as if the carpet had become the calm surface of a pond, only to be disturbed by a thrown stone, and \'waves\' of carpeting began to cascade out in all directions. I became so excited just knowing that my trip had started.    My dad was being persistent about the lawn so I managed to walk out to the garage to get the mower. On the way out, all I could do was stare in awe at the beauty of the clouds floating through the blue sea of the sky. They seemed to be zipping right across the sky at 100 miles an hour. This sense of awe never left from that moment, up until the end of the trip. I knew that my dad was going to start bitching if I didn\'t get on the lawn so I proceeded to start the mowing. I couldn\'t concentrate on what I was doing, and found myself actually stumbling and going in zig-zags. The whole time I was mowing thoughts began to rush through my mind, faster and faster. The thoughts were mainly of a benign and pleasant manner, and I began to feel most satisfied with my present outlook on life. I felt so happy with my understanding of the world that it seemed as if I would burst. This sense of ultra-understanding and supreme happiness and tranquility would come to characterize my future experiences with HBWR seeds.    After finishing about half of the lawn, my friend Ashley stopped by, and we had a nice little chat about school. I was grateful that I could take a break from the mindless labor of lawn-mowing, and soon my dad appeared on the porch and said that dinner was ready. Ashley and I said our good-byes and I was back in the house.    The first thing I noticed was a green, crocodilian monster lying on the dining room floor, that gazed up at me with huge eyes and a gaping smile of teeth. I started a little upon noticing this threatening looking beast lying on the floor, but soon realized that it was just one of my little brother\'s toys. That damned thing still gave me the creeps, so I maintained distance from it for the rest of my trip.    I sat down to dinner with my dad, my step-mom, and my two little half-brothers around 7:30 p.m. The normal topics of dinner table discussion seemed to hold a whole new level of meaning and entertainment. My dad\'s work-place tales of mis-guided maintenance men seemed to be remarkably funny, and the antics of my two little brothers, (1 and 3 years old at the time), simply made my inner-being laugh and smile. I noticed that the chicken in italian marinade tasted like the best food I had ever eaten, however, it was also the most time consuming meal I have ever eaten. Even as I savored the delicious taste and texture of the meat, I struggled to swallow every mouthful. I don\'t know if it was an actual physical phenomenon, or just my mind playing games, but it took forever to eat that one chicken breast.    After dinner, around 8:15, I went to my room to chill and listen to some music. For the remainder of the evening I was delighted by the pleasant mindset brought on by the LSA, as well as the little visuals I was getting. Shadows on the wall would constantly move and nothing wanted to hold still. The carpet still seemed more like a body of water than a body of fabric, ripples flowing through it occasionally. I fell asleep around 11 p.m., still feeling good and still slightly tripping.    In retrospect, that was a wonderful first experience with lysergic acid based hallucinogens. However, after taking them several more times, I realized that HBWR seeds could either give me a wonderful experience if I did them right, or an evening of  sickness and vomiting. As a final thought, I\'d like to add that my favorite part of the experience, besides the pleasant mental aspect, was the feeling that my consciousness had overflowed my physical body, and had spilled out to fill the entirety of whatever room I was in. That is about the only way I can describe how it feels."
44883,Worst Trip Ever,Ancient Savage,"May 15, 2008",H.B. Woodrose Seeds & Syrian Rue,"This was by far the worst experience ever.  There are a few conditions I probably shouldnt be tripping under (like living at my dads girlfriends house with him and her, after having a life threatening drug problem when living with him once before; and using drugs while on the medications I\'m on) but I have been doing so anyways.  For this, I have been punished.    SO I thought I knew everything about tripping, and i went ahead and used something (harmala) that I didnt know everything about, how stupidly arrogant.  For this I was very severely punishished.    I took 25 HBWS at 9:00, and then at a little after 11:00 when they were starting to kick in, I took 6 grams of syrian rue.  They must have had some sort of reaction with each other and probably the medications that I\'m on (Wellbutren and Lamictal) because one single bad thing happened to me and then it sent my brain into this loop of bad thoughts, really really bad thoughts, and not just the kind where your like oh I\'m a little sad because something bad happened, the kind where the walls are caving in, and your suffocating and the whole world is crashing down on you.      In this loop my thoughts exposed only the bad things in everything that crossed my mind, and these bad things exploded in my mind--explosions so big that they had physical symptoms i could see, hear and feel, and it went with almost every thought.  I took some Trazadone, which is an antidepressant with a powerful sedative agent, cause i thought it would put me to sleep.  well i was wrong, it ended up going right in with the explosions and making them ten times worse, only adding new symptoms such as dizziness and simple/boring yet weird/intrusive visual hallucinations of bright light.      I laid down on my bed to try to go to sleep but couldnt, and I ended up throwing up all over myself and my bed, the explosions made me so fucked up that i could not even walk or move right, so i just laid in my horrible smelling puke, luckily my door was shut and there was a sign on it saying \'do not disturb, meditation in process\', so even if someone got up to use the bathroom they would not look in and see me, or smell the awful smell.  so i laid in my puke all night, got a little sleep (which was a miracle) probably only cause my mind got so freaked out that it just shut itself down.      I could not be in the dark because of the terrifying hallucinations so i slept with the light on like a little baby.  after 3 hours of sleep i woke up at 6 in the morning, and the trip had lightened up a little from the overwhealming intensity, but i was still in that mental loop, still not functioning right, and now the puke smell was very very overpowering, and my dads girlfriend was awake and getting ready for work, so I had to sit by my window and wait for her to leave.  Meanwhile trying to think of good things was futile because like i said my mind could only think of the bad things, an undending chain of exploding badness in everything.  I also smashed my head on the ground just trying to move, because of how disoreinted i was.    Well I didnt suffer any horrible physical injury, though i should have because of a few occurrances i did not mention.  I had many strange and dangerous urges i did not succumb to, that would have been devistating if i had, and for these things i am lucky, very lucky.  It has now been almost 40 hours and I am just returning to normal.  I have many times been (mentally) into the depths of hell (hell enough to go to the psychiatric ward a few times for a couple weeks) but this trip made any mental hell i have ever been in look like winning a billion dollars and having sex with all kinds of beautiful women.  This is not anything anyone, no matter how hard they like tripping, or even scary trips like the ones on DMT (which i also enjoy) would ever want.      My Administrative advisor on the use of Entheogens (I will modestly admit that I am a Guru with an official council) tells me that I suffered a \'Psychotic Break\' due perhaps to the medications I am on and the effects of the MAOI--which he says multiplies the effects of any drug, and prevents the brain from oxidizing/metabolizing chemicals (who the fuck would want that anyway, with all the shit that could possibly go horribly wrong by it?)  So I am telling all of you reading this, Never ever combine all of the things (and doses) i took to generate this experience (HBWS, Syrian Rue, Wellbutren, Lamictal, Trazadone), and always know your substances--ALWAYS.  Being a guru I have taken hallucinogens like it was my job (a fraction of it kind of is), and I have up until this arrogant moment, avoided any and all bad trips, or trips too bad to handle, even though i have had scary ones.  Well now because of the iceburg i crashed into, I have to take a break from entheogens, like the titanic took a break from sailing.  Be careful trippers."
68693,Next to Nothing for the Fourth Time,daytripper,"Apr 14, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"I cannot for the life of me understand what I have been doing wrong in any case this is my fourth \'experience\' using the baby woodrose seeds. Each time after trying mostly the same form of extraction or whatever you\'d like to call it I came up with minor threshold effects. Here is the general procedure I followed:     1. Soak the seeds in an alcohol or ethanol   2. Remove the outer coating if needed after dry  3. Grind the seeds up (powder in some cases, small particles in others  4. Soak the seeds again in a filter and water creating a solution of supposed LSA  5. Ingest the liquid, not the seed junk    In each case I felt the effects within five to ten minutes. These included: a slight lethargic feeling, some tingling and minor light effect (brighter than normal). Each time I tried some variation on above mentioned process and each time after 30 minutes any effects went away. I must also state, that I took those on an empty stomach.     I\'m not sure if I need to buy some sort of specialized HWBR to get the higher LSA content in it or what, but I feel that people may have left out pertinent information in the reports I\'ve read. I know there is a way to truly extract the LSA from these seeds, but feel that as a common psychonaut I don\'t have the ability or resources.     My only hint as to why this isn\'t working has to do with the fact that the first time I took them, all I did was swallow the seeds. In this case the effects were much more akin to that of a real trip. There was an onset, a peak and a coming down period. It was also much like some of the other reports I\'ve seen. As far as I know the seeds should be edible as long as they have been properly clearned. Therefore after much trouble I\'d say to obtain any noticable effects I\'d need to eat the actual seed."
68767,Water Extraction Version 1.0.0,Khorbis,"Feb 19, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"Woodrose Extraction Version 1.0.0    1. Grind HBW seeds (for more potency, try the Madagascar variety) to a fine powder based on preferred dosage (~5-12 seeds common, varies per individual) Adding a few addition seeds than your usual dose is recommended since some potency WILL be lost in the process.     *Some have mentioned that scraping the seeds will reduce nausea, but there is absolutely NO scientific evidence to support that conjecture. Do it if you wish, but it is time consuming and, most likely, pointless*     2. Open a tea bag (store bought is fine) CAREFULLY and add ground HBW powder along with 1 gram of fresh grated ginger and/or mint leaves (optional, but medically proven to reduce nausea), re-staple bag, shake to mix, set aside.     3. Obtain a sizable mason jar (or any jar with a tight lid)    4. Fill jar with a quantity of COLD de-ionized (aka distilled or doubled distilled) water (~ 1 oz./5 HWB)      5. Dissolve a small amount of tartaric acid powder (available online, though cream of tartar will work in a pinch, albeit weakly) in the water (~1 mg. of acid / seed)    *Alternatively, in lieu of using distilled water and tartaric acid powder, white wine can be used because it already contains the necessary tartaric acid. In addition, the LSAs in HBW are more soluble in alcohol*      6. Place tea bag(s) in jar, secure lid, and place in a brown paper bag (to reduce exposure to LSA-destroying sunlight and heat). Shake well.     7. Place jar in refrigerator and leave for 12-24 hours (no longer than 24 to avoid mold/bacteria). Shake as often as you can/want, the more the better.     *For those of you who cant be bothered with shaking, I find that placing a cheap, CLEAN waterproof ladys vibrator in the jar works as an extremely effective gyrator*      8. After time has elapsed, remove the teabag (and vibrator if used\x85duh) and squeeze excess juice into jar, discarding teabag afterwards.     9. At this point, your concoction is ready for consumption. If you are still worried about nausea, chew on an additional piece of fresh ginger, some mint leaves, or you could take some OTC Dramamine, Bismuth, Meclizine,  Posphorylated carbohydrate solution, or Promethazine if you can get it (prescription Rx). Taking on an empty (or near empty) stomach is usually helpful also. If you are worried about taste, adding sugar, honey, or other sweeteners will not affect potency.    I suggest 5-12 seeds per person, based on weight, age, tolerance, mindset, etc."
36798,Intense TV,Wylson,"Jan 12, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"It all happened like this. Long ago, before the internet, (1990). A friend of mind ordered some woodrose seeds out of a magazine. She then sold me a dozen or so seeds. Then myself and another girlfriend (actually a friend=girl) were to spend an evening tripping at my place. I have never tripped, she was a BIG acid head.    So we each took 3 or 4 seeds. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. After about 2 hours, she took 4 more, but I declined. We sat around for another hour or so and she finally had had enough. With a quick gesture she was up and out of there. I was now alone. It was about 7 pm.    So I decided to watch some t.v. Back then, we only had about 4 network channels (unless you were rich and had cable or satellite). I was watching NBC. As I watched, I played with a pen in may hand. And played. And played. After about 20 minutes of this, I noticed....I\'m starting to trip! It had been about three hours since swallowing the seeds. So then \'Dear John\' (t.v. sitcom) came on. And I laughed like I have never laughed before. I mean, it was side splitting hysterical, but also controlled laughter at the truly funny parts. I really \'got into\' the comedy.    Then the phone rang. When I went to get to the phone (across the room on the floor) I found myself crawling, not walking to it. It seemed far more \'natural\' to crawl. I think I took too long though because it was dead when I picked it up. So the night went on, and I just got more and more \'stoned trippy\'. Then a crime show came on about 10 pm. It was about organized crime and whatnot. And I was REALLY into it. Not scared or anything, just gripped by the intensity and drama. To me, it was like watching an Academy Award winning film like The Godfather, it was that intense. So then around 12am, I decided to go to bed. I was entering a strange phase of my trip, kind of dark with purple pyramid scapes and a mantra from that day (drug free America phrase) saying \'Don\'t let drugs get in the way of YOUR dreams!\'. Sleep then came down.    The next morning, I was REALLY groggy. Someone was knocking at my door, but I ignored it. Then that person crawled in through my window! Why? It was the girl from the night before. She thought I was DEAD so she broke in to see me. Why did she think I was dead you ask? Because she had a BAD trip the night before. Remember, she took 8 seeds. Then she left. Turns out she went out to dinner later with an uncle. By the time the breadbasket came to the table, she started to see the bread rolls dancing around. She went to the bathroom (to throw up perchance?) but nothing happened I\'m sure. When she came back to the table, she just told her uncle outright \'Dude, I\'m tripping balls. Please take me home\'. Luckily her uncle was a Head too, so he obliged.    Back at home, she spent all night in front of the toilet, throwing up, shaking, tripping and whatnot. A Marilyn Monroe poster on her wall kept trying to grab her. She kept thinking of calling 911, but she never did, thank God. She just tripped, and trembled and puked. What a way to go. By morning light she was okay enough to drive. She had worried all night that I had been the same way, but I was fine! She then went to my place to check on me. When I didn\'t answer my door, she freaked! So she broke in through the window. She described unto me a LIVING HELL and I am SOOOOOO glad that I had had a good trip instead. By the way, I have not done woodrose since!"
36597,Bumpy Ride,Melon,"Jan 9, 2008","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Nitrous Oxide","Well, my good friend and myself decided to do some H.B. Woodrose. This was my first time with the Woodrose, and so wasn\'t sure what to expect. My friend B had some experience, but only in a low dosage, I think around six seeds. He reported a mild \'not quite with it\' feeling, nothing major. He later decided to smoke some cannabis, which apparently massivley enhanced the trip.    So anyway, we started the day by having one spot of cannabis each. This would have been around 11:40. We spent around half and hour peeling the fuzzy stuff off the seeds and consumed them as we peeled. It was 12:10 (midday) by the time we finished eating all 15 seeds. The effect came on alot quicker for myself, then it did for B, I\'d say I could start feeling it within 10 - 15 minutes of consumption.    By 12:20 we were feeling very stoned, and could feel the Woodrose coming on pretty fast. This was accompanyed by slight nausea. I started acting really strange, at least I felt like I was. Like I would act like a kid again, I would speak in a high pitced voice just because it was fun making mock voices (it ammused me anyway), and I was putting on quite an act. But the weird thing is, at the same time it felt like just that, an act. I could act completly sober when I wanted to, it just seemed like my \'normal\' self was all fucked up, to be sober I had to make a conscience effort. There was also a noticable uplifting high, apart from sickness.    At 12:30, we were felling really stoned, and more of the above. I must also note that what started off as an \'uplifting high\' had now turned into more of a bad high. We were both feeling really sick, and really negative. Almost the beginning of a bad trip, but not quite, just felt really bad, physically more than mentally, but defiently both. At this point B decided to smoke some more pot to try and combat the sickness. I\'m, not sure if it worked or not, as I decided not to take any. After another 10 or so minutes the sickness had almost left me, and I was starting to feel pretty good again.     From this point on, I can\'t be specific about time frames, because as we tripped, we wrote everything down on a brown paper bad (seemd a good place to write it at the time). I\'ve been basing the report around those times. But the last entry on the bag begins with an entry around 14:20 and some crazy writing. From there the writing begins to slope and wiggle all over the page and gets totally unreadable. It\'s actually pretty funny looking at the bag and comparing the first few entries, which are totally readable, with the last few, and especially the last one.    So anyway, after we thought we had defeated the sickness, we decided to walk to the beach (I live right beside it). We started walking and my legs/thighs started really hurting, like they had electical currents passing through them, really uncomfortable and sore. It got worse and worse, and I was almost gunna sit down, but I just put up with it.     We got to the beach and I sat down in front of the surf becide a peice of washed up wood, and I started to feel realllly bad, and realllly sick. I knew I was about to spew, and I managed to utter a short warning to clear the area before I embarked on one of the most intense experiences of my life (throwing up). It was such a negative experience, like my whole body was exploding and then been glued together again all at the same time. What lasted only a few short seconds seemed to last for hours. I thought I was traped in an world where all I knew was a gut wrenching vile intensity feeling, like snakes climbing up through my mouth. I compare it to the exact opposite of an orgasim, extremealy intenst, but replace the good feeling with a really bad one.    After I spewed I must have just layed there for five minutes (seemed like five hours) just totally exhausted. But I eventually came right (after about 10 minutes) and the trip took a whole new turn. After what had been on the verge of a bad trip was suddenly boosted to a new level where all the bad things were replaced by good things. It was like I was spewing up shit, like I was been cleansed from all the crap that socicety puts on us, and everything we experience.    From then on it was a really great trip. I experienced miled hallucinations, but the main feature for me was that my mind was way way clearer. Like all these little thoughts were coming to mind without me even thinking about it. As an example, I suddenly realised that \'good\' and \'evil\' do not even exist, they are mearly a different way of perceving the same situtation. They are the two different sides of the same coin, for good to \'exist\' there must be evil, and vice versa (many little gems of wisdom came to me that day). Compared to Psilocybian, it was more of a thought high, rather than a nature/earthly high, if that makes sense.    So yeah I ended up having a really good trip in the end. We came up from the beach and we did a can of NOS each, which was cool, I imagine it to be what heorin feels like, it boosted me up to a level five trip for three seconds. B wasn\'t so lucky however, he continued to have a very bad trip, even after throwing up. He was very quiet, sometimes just lying on the ground moaning. He kept asking for some broccoli, so I cooked up a stirfry with rice (it\'s great fun to cook a meal while tripping). The next day he told me I had saved his life, by listening to him and giving him broccoli. I also forgot to mention I did another spot just before I cooked the dinner, but for some odd reason it didn\'t effect me at all.    All in all, despite the bumpy ride, a great experience. The whole thing must have lasted about 5 hours, but the effects still slightly noticable the next day."
36524,The Good and the Bad,Sekktor,"Jan 8, 2008",H. B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I had been reading about a bunch of different `legal\' highs that I could purchase, and came across `Hawaiian Baby Woodrose\' seeds. Up until now, the only other hallucinogens I\'ve ever tried are shrooms and DXM. I\'m also a frequent cannabis smoker and also smoke cigarettes.    The day started out good, I awoke at 8:00, went to my only class of the day, and came back to my dorm, where a package was waiting for me. It contained a package of 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds (Hawaiian strain). Mindset was great, I sat down and meditated for a while. I hadn\'t eaten anything that day, took my daily vitamins (Multivitamin, Vitamin C (500mg), and Vitamin B). Earlier in the day I chewed on a package of Betel Nut chew.    10:30: I scraped off 7 seeds, put into a coffee grinder, let sit in cold water.    11:26: Drank the mixture. Didn\'t taste bad, although it was a bit gritty.    11:56: A bit of nausea, vision was a little strobey, a body buzz started to come on. At this time, my friend M came over, and I walked over to his dorm to hang out for a little bit. Decided to go back when he finished packing to go home.    12:11: Back in the dorm room, starting to feel something a bit different. Vision wasn\'t much different, although colours were quite a bit brighter.    1:00: My log says `Yep.\', so I\'m guessing this was when I started seeing visuals. During the majority of my trip I was laying down on my bed, back down, looking at the ceiling. My ceiling is heavily textured, and I began to see what looked to be writing. I couldn\'t make out what it said, but it definately looked like some sort of cursive. About this time, I started noticing a bit of fluttering in the walls and celing. I decided to take 4 more seeds to bring me up to 11.     1:52: Full blown visuals, body buzz built up to an amazing jolt of energy. Smoked some weed to get rid of nausea. Thought patterns were extremely racy, I couldn\'t get a hold on a specific thought.    2:11: A maintenance worker came in to check to see if my roommate\'s light had been fixed, I managed to tell him that it was and that they were out of town. I acted like I was sleeping. Looked in the mirror, eyes were extremely dilated, couldn\'t see my iris anymore. Bad move, took 9 more seeds. My thought was `Well, I can only live once\'.    (Lost track of time for a few hours after this)    3:00-5:00: We had 3 fire alarms during this two hour block. I was tripping very heavily, and felt very afraid that everyone knew that I was tripping. This is where the trip turned bad. Every time I would go back to my room, I would keep hearing the fire alarms, and it began to make me very agitated and worried.     6:30: I tried to smoke some weed, but the second the hit came into my lungs, I vomited. And if I thought it couldn\'t get any worse, it did. I began to think `Oh my god. I am not going to come down. I am going to die. I will never do drugs again.\'. This continued for about an hour and a half. I was sweating profusely. Vision was something I had no recollection of. Everything was rocking, spinning. The celing was tilting. My television began to look like it was melting. In a more positive state of mind, I would have enjoyed this thorougly, but due to the circumstances, It disturbed me terribly.    8:00: Still tripping, but more managable. I talked to a friend of mine online, trying to get him to help me make sense of this whole ordeal. I decided to go take a shower. Very good idea. It was extremely enjoyable. Each individual drop looked like it was dancing; The warm water felt very good on my body. I get dressed in my pajamas, and head to the kitchen for a glass of water and a bowl of miso soup. Return to my room and listen to some music (Pinback).    9:30: My roommate comes home. Our dorms are actually apartments, so everyone has a seperate bedroom. My door was locked, but he loves to chatter about random stuff, so he knocked on my door. I acted like I was asleep.    3:30: What happened? I don\'t think I went to sleep (Although I could have, since I was lying under my blankets, pulled over my head so I could have complete darkness. Still having minor visuals, vision started to fade a bit, but then came back, and I saw a fractal pattern covering everything.    4:20 (Ironic): I smoke some weed to calm down, works well, and am able to sleep.    The next day I awoke, actually feeling refreshed, although I have this nasty taste in my mouth; A nasty, eartly flavour, almost like the scent of compost. I tried to make out what happened, and I\'m guessing that after the fire alarms sounded, I got extremely nervous, or that extremely large dosage could\'ve hit during that time, and I wasn\'t ready for it."
58339,Nice Except for Nausea,LHS,"Jan 3, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"First of all I\'d like to give a quick description of myself, I\'m 17, go to college I have no mental/physical problems whatsoever and have only previously taken mushrooms that I pick myself (Psilocybe Semilanceata). I first found out about these seeds on the internet and was immediately intrigued. I had read every review going and made my mind up that I would give these seeds a shot. I ordered 50 of them from a trusted source. They arrived and I prepared them as follows:    1. Peeled off all the outer layer plus the tougher fuzz underneath, this took about 2 hours or more (seriously!). I used a knife to scrape. They can be very fiddly and because they are very small they kept slipping out of my grasp. I also noticed some were darker than others, dark brown to light brown.    2. Once I had finished this tedious task I smashed them up with a hammer, they were in a small sealed bag as I did this. I kept on hammering them until they were into minute chunks.    3. I then opened the bag and tipped its contents into a glass, the smell was quite strong!    4. I then boiled up some water and waited for it to cool, once it was warm I poured a small amount into the glass and left to brew.     5. The following day I woke up and took hold of the glass that had been brewing throughout the night, the water was a olive green and there was seed matter floating on the top.    I looked at the time and saw it was 9:00am. I felt slightly tired but was all the time thinking \x91Just drink it down and then its done with. So I took one massive mouthful and swallowed. It didnt taste all that bad. Only until I drank near to the end it suddenly hit me that this stuff actually was foul, YUK! I drank the remaining seed gunk at the end. \x91Phew, glad that is over with, I thought to myself then pulled the duvet over me and began to rest.    About 20 minutes of laying in my bed my stomach began to feel bloated and slightly uncomfortable, I had to lie in a certain position to feel ok. Another 20 minutes passed and I felt nauseous. I got out of bed and walked to the toilet and sat beside it waiting for the sickness to take effect. I have read so many reports stating sickness so I was prepared for that eventuality. There was a constant need to burp, I sat there burping, each time thinking if there was something going to come up. Until I got so mad that I stuck my fingers down my throat and wretched, I did this twice, still not sick but a whole lot better for doing so. I got up and walked back to bed feeling quite strange. I took a nap, which is very unusual for me, and woke up 10 minutes later with the effects in full swing.     I got out of bed and tried to walk, my legs felt very stiff, quite heavy and my balance was altered, I nearly fell over. My head felt light, definitely a \x91high feeling I walked to the bathroom and looked in the mirror, my pupils were dilated a lot, which gave a good sign to my intoxication. I decided to go for a walk to the shop. When I was walking it felt as though I was floating (its very hard to describe) quite pleasant and when I looked behind me a strange feeling of unfamiliarity swept over me, things seemed different but at the same time I knew exactly what I was seeing was familiar, strange. Euphoria was present, I seemed happy within myself.    I stopped walking and stared down at a lake and watched the ducks thinking how nice nature is. Lots of other things that wouldnt usually interest me did that day. There are not many visual effects of HBWS if not any at all. I had one minor hallucination (if it was one) as I was walking down the road I looked over at a tree and thought I saw someone standing there but quickly realised it was just the tree all along, this was around the peak of the \x91trip. I walked into the shop and grabbed some lunch only to see one of my Dads mates in there. As my thinking was altered, I felt as though my talking was too and it became a battle to appear normal when chatting to him. I made it quick and said \x91Bye.    The walk was long and the effects were slowly wearing off on the way home. I got home and started to eat. Things became tastier and I noticed the flavours were more apparent in what I ate, this was nice. I still felt high and a bit tired. I feel as though the initial sick feeling really spoils this drug, but apart from that I would have to say the effects are nice and last quite long mine from 9:00am-2:00pm theyre good for a day with nothing else to do. I will eat some more but not just yet.    Anyway I hope this experience of mine was useful I have given very accurate facts as to what happened. I would probably suggest to people who dont like feeling or being sick not to have these as they will almost definitely make do that to you. In my opinion these are no comparison to mushrooms but they are different in their own unique way, mushrooms is visual, mind bending and euphoric with no sickness. They are good for someone wanting to come off other drugs Id imagine."
33922,"Intense, Painful, and a Great Experience",Korefuji,"Dec 7, 2007", H.B. Woodrose,"The best experiences seem to be with between 2-8 seeds, though the method in which they\'re ingested varies too. Some crush and make it into a tea. Some chew it. Some use other methods. They all work, dependent on amount and so on. So, in theory, even taking two seeds the wrong way can fuck me up. Taking a lot more, the wrong way can fuck me up for good. I\'m sort of prepared for that, I\'ve sort of done what I need to get to this point. I will only take two seeds to begin. But should I take more and it goes bad, I think I\'m prepared mentally.    The five seeds were in a sealed bag. They don\'t look amazing. Shit, they look like droppings. Or some special exotic nut. You can grab a handful of them and you\'ll have about fifty or so. I wouldn\'t advise eating them all, unless you plan to play \'Poker\' with the devil. And he\'ll be doing all the poking.    My nails had grown longer. I used them to scratch of the brown skin on the seeds. I took a pair of scissors and tried to cut one gently to break it\'s shell. Of course, it didn\'t have a shell. I was holding the fucking seed. I assumed the brown bit was the \'husky shell\'. It didn\'t look husky, but it did look like a shell. How the fuck did I know? I chipped a small bit off, but it wasn\'t significant. I don\'t even know how to take these, I mean, may be it is the shell. Will I end up poisoning myself? Acid rose up my throat.  haven\'t been feeling to great since yesterday with the whole LXD crap. I still have 12 left. I\'ll finish those later. I tried to crush one between my fingers, but it just slipped out and I caught it before it fell. These fuckers are hard as hell.    I read the best way to take them is too constantly chew them and place them under your tongue. To make it easier to chew, place them in a glass of water and microwave. I decided to do this. But before I did, I needed to prepare. Take a piss, turn on the fan, turn off the lights, and stick on a few episodes of Futurama. Perhaps it was fate that made buy the complete set. Perhaps it was fate that made me randomly pick out the DVD in which Bender becomes God. It put a smile on my face as I saw this when I took the shrooms. I wondered whether I would fall asleep or if I could watch it through. They\'re supposed to be strong. I needed colour, quick movement, and jokes. Futurama had this all. The smartest cartoon since The Simpsons, and superior in so many ways. Most Americans didn\'t get it, so it got the can. Shame.    Time to prepare. I went downstairs, picked up transparent glass and dropped the two seeds in. I look at them in the glass and said,    \'Time to rock my babies\'    I poured some of the cheap mineral water my mother buys. I decided against using Evian as I would probably waste it if this was bad. I spun the seeds around with the handle of a spoon, and watched as the seeds danced to the flow of the water, round and round they went, like some synchronized competition. I placed the glass of water with the seeds in the microwave and shut it\'s door. Two minutes? Naw, let\'s go for one first. I tapped start and it began. Pearl Jam\'s \'Betterman\' came into my head. Good song. I decided to go for another minute. It spun again. Pearl Jam\'s \'Whipping\' was playing now. Good song. I touched the glass after I opened the door. HOT. I grabbed the over gloves, and saw murky water with two seeds at the bottom. I was impressed thus far. I grabbed some kitchen towel and wrapped the glass, taking it to my room. I left it to cool and will take it in a moment. Back soon, unless I\'m dead.      The following is after taking the seeds and during the first few hours:    Ok I wasn\'t sure if that went right. I drank the resin water, and tried to chew the seeds. But they broke in my mouth. I tried to keep them under my tongue, but this didn\'t seem to work. I expected it to be chewable but it wasn\'t. I was watching the episode of Futurama where they have the \'What If\' machine, and Fry asks \'What if life was like a video game?\' It\'s brilliant, as I haven\'t seen this episode. It\'s so great! These are all the classics: Asteroids, Battlezone, Space Invaders. I shed a tear and respect the makers. I\'m going to take one more seed, even though I already feel something from the other two. Nothing may happen you know, though I feel lightheaded. HOLY FECK! It\'s Q-Bert!    The left leg feels heavy, my right shoulder is iffy and now my right foot is going. Still, one more seed eh? I\'ll try without the, thing. I can\'t remember what\'s called. The foot? The girl. The foot. The foot. The...chicken. Wow. Colourful episode. One more seed. SEED! Leyla looks kinky in that garb. One eyed girls aren\'t so bad looking.    What I learnt, what I surmised from reading the accounts of others, I did not take on board. Perhaps it was my metabolism, perhaps it was idiocy, I don\'t quite know. I think it was disappointment. Here I was, I had taken two seeds, extracted resin in the water and knocked them back. I had given it at least 35 minutes or so, as indicated in most accounts, and nothing had happened. Futurama was making me laugh, it was great. I was enjoying it, but nothing was happening with the Woodrose.    I took another seed, I scraped the crap off it and stuck it in my mouth. I chewed it, without microwaving it this time, and it was tough. I felt my tooth was going to break. The saliva had softened it enough, and I could feel the jaws pressuring the seed to break. It broke, the saliva mixing with the inside of the seed, creating a potent liquid in my mouth, which I gulped down. I collected the broken seed with my tongue, pulling them back to the front of my mouth, resting them underneath my tongue. I would mix saliva at the bottom of my mouth with the broken seed, and squeeze, extracting more of the chemicals and swallowing them down to be affected. I would sometimes shew the seeds again, and once more place them under my tongue. Eventually it disappeared. Still, another thirty minutes and still no effect.    Annoyed with having waited nearly an hour and a half, watching Futurama, I was getting frustrated and bored. I lost interest and took the remaining two seeds in the same manner as I did with the single seed. I had taken the five seeds, I had consumed them all, when really I shouldn\'t have. Yet, it had been two hours now and no effects. I was pretty pissed off, I mean I felt more light, I had moderate changes, I could feel something, even if I couldn\'t tell what it was.    I watched some TV. Drank from my bottle of Evian. I was so disappointed with the experience, I thought I would end up having to tell my friends, \'You know I was going on about Woodrose and how good they are? Well, they\'re not man. I feel well cheated.\' Of course I could write it up and say I had the most amazing experience ever, but it would have been lies, and I couldn\'t be fucked with lying. If I had a bad experience, why let others do the same? I would consider Morning Glory\'s as they supposedly work well, particularly with visual spells.    My thighs ached a little, particularly when taking a piss while standing, I could feel my bladder squeezing, and it then sending that pressure down the lower part of my legs near or around the pelvis area. It hurt uncomfortably, so I pissed slowly to ease the pain. My eyes were opening and closing a little more rapidly, and my focus was blurring a little. I put this down to tiredness and perhaps a side effect of the seeds. I flushed the toilet, washed my hands, and splashed some water on my face. It was a pretty hot night by now, with the fan on full whack, and the extractor fan running.    I read if I went to sleep, the visuals would be strong, and sure enough, perhaps because I wanted them, my visuals were stronger, more abstract and completely incoherent, as soon as I had shut my eyes. Normally I sleep with music on, but I had turned everything off. I felt lousy and pissed off. I was seeing images at a rapid rate, and almost like tunneling with a fish eye lens through images, people, worlds. It was incredibly abstract and incomprehensible and I tried to get something more focused, more normal than I had experienced. I wasn\'t ready for abstract visuals when I had such a piss poor time with the Woodrose seeds. Work now? Fuck that, I\'ll fight it.    The time showed 1.00am on the clock when I went to bed. I had started early with the seeds, and I had no joy. I decided to hit the sack properly. I shut my eyes, and started to see some seriously odd shit. I went through tunnels, and, I don\'t know, spiritual journey\'s of some description. I felt I was floating, physically while exploring worlds in my head. It was good, and I enjoyed it. I seemed to quickly drift into sleep.    The following is a retrospective account several days after the experience, and was not easily forgettable:    It was rather sudden, but my eyes opened. When they did, the room was spinning around me, warping, glowing. I said to myself \'crap! NOW It hits me!\'. I was annoyed because I didn\'t know how I could cope with it coming out of sleep. When I tried to look at the clock, I felt my body was being held down. Almost nothing was moving. I took a deep breath, and forced myself to my side. I couldn\'t focus on the clock with my eyes open. The world was just way too chaotic. Things seemed to be moving, swaying. Everything seemed bigger, or smaller than it\'s normal size.    To be honest, I was having difficulty keeping my eyes open, so I kept them shut. My bladder hurt, as I needed to take a piss. When I normally wake up from sleep, I kinda feel rough, now I was trying to wake up in a state of disorientation. I couldn\'t tell my left from right immediately. I had to pick up the clock, which had reasonable sized display. I closed both my eyes, staggering backwards into my bed, I opened my right eye a little and saw the time as 1.30am. I was a bit shocked, as I had only slept for 30 minutes, but I was totally screwed up.    I really needed to go to the toilet, and so I tried at first with my eyes open. But I just kept shutting them in the dark. I have a fan with a lamp on my ceiling. I went to grab the light side of the pulling lever to turn the light on. When I tried to grab it, it seemed to be drifting further away from me. By the time I gave up I was still on my bed, I hadn\'t actually moved, even though I felt I had. I had no focus, and things was just warping and moving way to fast for me to cope with. Sounds were louder, but I also felt quite numb physically.    Staggering and feeling my around to my door, it was quite difficult to open it. I couldn\'t figure it out if I pushed it in or out, I felt I had sort of woken up by now. I had been awake for what felt like hours, but looking at the clock it had been 5 minutes. I was exhausted, sweating and in some pain. I eventually made it the toilet, but I just couldn\'t be bothered with the light. I didn\'t have the will. When I realised it was too dark, I just had to turn the light on. Doing so almost blinded me, and I had to shut my eyes again.    Taking a piss was a difficult job. I felt I had to clean everything out of my bladder, and when I did, I felt huge pain round my upper thighs near the pelvic region. I had to urinate slowly to reduce the pain. My legs were in further pain, and I felt incredibly drunk, incoherent, and lost. I was shaking, I felt some panic about what was happening, as I regretted taking all five now, or at least going to sleep. If I was awake I felt I would have been better prepared.    Seeing as I couldn\'t stay awake, as I kept edging off my chair, I decided to throw myself onto my duvet. I lay there, staggered, tired, and beaten. I couldn\'t describe what I was feeling other than both uncomfortable and pleasurable. I was experiencing some mind-bending visuals, the likes of which I hadn\'t experienced even with LSD. At points they seemed more focused, and I felt I was \'with\' people. I felt surrounded by people, it was quite odd. On the other hand, I was experiencing this and not being able to comprehend or to write this down, as I wanted to, was frustrating for me. The purpose of taking this was to document on the fly. I even wanted to record something on camera, but I just couldn\'t do anything. I was almost paralytic, and just sweated profusely.    I gathered enough energy to get to my PC, and thought putting on some Enigma might help. I thought, \'ambient and tribal\' would be suited. It just got annoying as hell, so I turned over to some heavy metal. This proved folly also, which led to everything being turned off. The only sound now remaining was the extractor fan and the ceiling fan. It was calming, but at the same time the physical and mental distress I was going through was not slowing down, but was increasing.    To some extent, I felt I had gotten through the worst of it. I was now going through the \'oh my life sucks so bad, let\'s re-evaluate your existence\' mode, as everything I had done to date was put together like some physical jigsaw puzzle that once put together completed my life as it was now. And then I saw how I could change it, and what it actually meant to be happy and so on. The revelations came and went, and I felt better by the hour mentally.    Physically I was in trouble. I wanted to call out to my mother, and say, \'I\'m fucked\'. I thought about calling the ambulance service, but I had doubts as to how bad it was. Well, it was bad enough that I was hallucinating about scary demons in my room, things shifting places, the room warping and spinning, my walls glowing. Things weren\'t quite right I knew this much, but I thought this could only last for another few hours. I would sit it out.    Of course, I completely messed this up as it didn\'t last a few hours. It lasted until the next morning at 3am on Sunday, having started on Friday night. For most of Saturday I was tripping, with more control in the later day, but still barely able to open my eyes. The sounds of the bids tweeting killed my head, and it felt like having my skull drilled into while I was awake. Tweet they went, die they didn\'t.    I drank lots of water, and juice. I tried to get some energy back over Saturday, and I went to the toilet 20-30 times during the day. As the day went on, and I controlled my visuals more, I became a lot more chilled than I had expected. I was still tripping though. So I couldn\'t open my eyes too much, because the whole world changed when I did. I was slow, my motor functions reduced. Comprehension and understanding were very minimal, I was in a euphoric state of calm mentally. Physically, I was still uncomfortable and going to the toilet a lot. Even after 12-16 hours, urinating was painful.    By Sunday, I was completely relaxed. Even when I was shouting, I felt stoned, so I wasn\'t shouting too much. I found it difficult to get angry or experience hyper tension as I often do. At one point I felt nothing could phase me ever again, and I was pretty damn happy. I hoped I could be that way forever, sadly I remembered I had work the next day. As Sunday continued, I started to wake up again mentally and physically, resetting to my original state. I was able to eat food again, which I found difficult to do during the experience. I felt refreshed and alive, and had a good dinner and a great sleep.    Overall, I think if I was awake, the startling reaction would not have been so intense. I expect the experience would remain as intense, but I would be better prepared for it. I will probably take 2-3 seeds initially, wait for a reaction BEFORE I take anymore. Or I may take five again.    It was a worthwhile experience, and in hindsight I enjoyed every moment of it. Even the bad, because most of it was pretty visually stimulating, and the side effects were a small part of the larger experience, as I was very high for all the time, even with the periods of insanity. I admit, I felt I was going a bit mad. I have mental health issues anyway, so perhaps this added to that, but then who doesn\'t have mental health problems?     I would definitely do it again, but I would recommend others take 3 seeds and move upwards from there if you feel like it if you\'re a first timer. I don\'t know if it\'s my own metabolism which took so long to get the seeds working, but when it happened, it hit me like a freight train. I will be repeating this with a friend, hopefully at least two, and wonder if more people would accentuate the experience further.    A very intense experience lasting two and half days. I look forward to more."
33785,X/Y = 0.999999,KillFrenzy,"Nov 28, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Before I start this report, I should mention that I was living in student accomodation at the time and not eating properly, I had lost a bit of weight so this could have attributed to the effects. I had tried HB woodrose seeds once before, but only in a small dose which just resulted in nausea and back-ache so I was expecting more of the same this time. I removed the fuzzy husks and ground them up roughly then drank them in a cup of milk. My friend M took 5 seeds at the same time but just chewed them up whole, without the husks. It was about 10pm.    It started out okay, a bit mellow for the first hour or so, this time I did not experience any nausea, I think this is because of the milk. My friend however felt extremely sick. I did feel a general discomfort though, I couldn\'t tell you which part of my body was affected, I just felt like whichever position I sat in I wouldn\'t be comfortable or relaxed. I wasn\'t feeling any psychedelic effects but my mind felt a bit fuzzy and confused, I would not say it was a pleasurable feeling.    Me and M started to watch the Japanese film Audition. The first hour and a half of the movie lulled me into a false sense of security by portraying itself as a beautiful love story. The action is so slow paced and gentle that I had started to relax and the effects of the seeds did not seem so unpleasant. Half an hour before the end of the film I decided to smoke a bowl of marijuana in the kitchen during the ad break.  As I finished my pipe then sat down to watch the rest of the film I realised the cannabis had kicked the seeds into life and the trip had turned decidedly more psychedelic.    Suddenly the film I was watching took a nasty turn. What I thought was a romantic love story actually turned out to be one of the most horrific things I\'ve ever seen. I\'m a big horror fan, I have most of the sickest and disurbing films on DVD and not one of them has ever frightened me, but this time the images on the screen were just too much. I felt light headed and sick. I had to turn away from the T.V. but I could still hear it so the images in my imagination were probably worse that the actual film. Terror filled my mind.    Trying to get rid of the sick feeling, I pored myself a cup of coke but after taking a few gulps I realized that I had poured coke into the cup that had contained the milk and woodrose seeds. This worsened the vomit feelings and I couldn\'t take any more, I had to leave the room and get away from the television. I took the litre bottle of coke with me and sat alone in the kitchen. I felt a cold sweat and such overwhelming mental turmoil that I thought I would collapse.    I looked around me and the world was breaking apart at the seams. Every line such as the corner of a table or where the wall met the ceiling was breaking apart. Fragments of reality were falling and swirling around me. I looked at the bottle of coke, which was the only thing in the room without any straight edges that could fall apart, and told myself \'If you can finish this bottle of coke you will be okay, just concentrate on finishing the bottle and get a grip on things.\'    Slowly I drank the coke and as the bottle emptied, my trip did get a lot less unbearable. I think it was because I had something definate to focus on, a single goal that would take my mind off everything else. When the bottle was empty I looked around the room again. The walls and corners were still fragmenting but now I felt like I had the mental control to handle it. Having found new courage and deciding that the trip wasn\'t so bad after all I watched the end last 5 minutes of the film whilst eating noodles.    Then came the next mistake. M, deciding he had poisoned himself, decided to go to bed so I was now left alone in my room at 2am after watching a horror film tripping my arse off. I felt the trip start to go bad again so I put some kind of news program on to take my mind off it but the news reporters voice rapidly changed from a slowed down low sound to a speeded up chipmunk voice. I turned off the TV to stop these auditory hallucinations and was left with the fragmenting reality visuals again. This time I decided to really look at these broken up images in an attempt to decipher what was really going on. For a long while a sat staring at the corner of my desk in an extremely deep train of thought. Then I started writing, I wrote page after page of my thoughts based on these visuals. I had concluded that what I was seeing was the broken up electrical signals of my brain trying to piece together the information coming from my eyes. I realised that everything we see/hear/touch/taste/smell is nothing more than an electrical impulse in our minds and then came to the conclusion that there is no reality and that \'mind\' was the only truth.    This I summed up in one simple equation:  X divided by Y = 0.99999999999 recurring  when X=(Y divided by X)  and Y=(X divided by Y)    Faced with this awakening to the horrible truth I became terribly afraid and depressed and wondered how I could go back to my normal life when I knew it was all a lie. I decided to try to sleep but when I went to bed all I could think about was horrific images from the film followed by long periods of depression because of the reality truth. I did not sleep once that night and they continued into the morning.     The next day I was a mental wreck, I would try to do normal everyday things but every 30 seconds or so I would \'zone out\' and flashback to either the film or the equation.I wouldn\'t even go outside and if I was walking about I asked my friend to stand with me in case I collapsed. By about 7 o\'clock that night the effects finally wore off but for weeks afterwards I refused to read the things I had wrote and every time I saw a Japanese girl in the street I would get a flashback to that movie.    NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN!"
33372,3 Strikes and I\'m Out,Norton,"Nov 18, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"There is a lot about myself that I don\'t know. For a while now, I\'ve had this feeling of there being an untapped resource in my mind. Not much, but maybe something that can help me process my thoughts differently, and make some changes in my life. In an attempt to reach this resource, I used Psiloscybin mushrooms. It was a wonderfully spiritual an emotional experience. Once wasn\'t enough, I felt. I wanted to continue my journey. Unfortunately, I haven\'t been able to procure any more shrooms, so I started looking at other psychoactive substances. My search led me to HBW. Natural, cheap, and legal. Beautiful. I read about varying dosages and preparations. The one about taking the seeds sub-lingually seemed worth a try.  Attempt 1:  I pulverized 10 seeds with pliers, and added them to a mouthful of fruit juice. I held the mixture in my mouth for 20 minutes. There were no effects, so I impulsively swallowed the whole mixture. Within minutes, I was dizzy and nauseous. I crawled into bed, hoping to sleep off the nauseousness. I might have tried to throw up, but I held it in, simply not wanting to leave my bed. For the next 8 hours, I drifted in and out of a fitful sleep. When I opened my eyes, my vision was hazy. When I closed my eyes, my visuals undulated. I felt horribly sick the whole time. The next day, I was dizzy.  Attempt 2:  I ground 20 seeds in a coffee grinder, and put them in a bottle of spring water. I let it steep for 2 days, frequently shaking it. This time, I took 2 Dramamine 30 minutes before consuming the water. I then strained out all the seed mush with a coffee filter, and drank half the water. Over the next hour, I slowly drank the other half of the bottle. This time was better. At first, I felt very floaty. The nausea came slowly, but was quite bearable. I took 2 caffeine pills to combat the sedation. After a few hours, which passed by like minutes, I went to sleep in my bed, anyway.  I slept somewhat well, and awoke without much dizziness. However, alone in my room, I got this awful feeling of impending doom. I was horribly scared. I felt as if I wasn\'t in the right world. As if I had been dropped into an alternate dimension. Everything seemed the same, but there was an eerie, unidentifiable difference. I felt very lonely. A friend invited me over his house, and I went, not wanting to be alone any longer. The 15-minute drive to his house was horrible. [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]   It was dark and raining heavily. My fear grew, and I had to fight the urge to cry. For the rest of the night, I couldn\'t shake that scared feeling.  Attempt 3:  I took 2 Dramamine, pulverized 15 seeds with pliers, and swallowed them with water. Again, I took to my bed and slept fitfully. After a few hours, I went to the bathroom and threw up. As soon as I threw up, my vision got noticeably clearer, and the nausea mostly subsided. I went back to bed for a few hours, waking up to go to work. As I write these words, I\'m at work, feeling like I\'m on a rollercoaster. I\'m dizzy, nauseous, and sleepy. I\'m praying for the end of my shift to come quickly so I can drag myself to my bed again.  I now have 14 seeds left, and I\'m going to just flush them. I\'ve given it 3 shots, and each has unpleasant, to say the least."
45866,Divine Intervention,Atomic_Revolution,"Nov 14, 2007","DXM, H.B. Woodrose, & Amanita pantherina","Holy fuck...where to begin. I guess I should start at the logical conclusion, the moment the shit hit the fan: Saturday. I dreamt I was a sculpture artist, creating a monstrosity of artwork, an abomination of beauty. It was a massive steel tree with cords that could be played like a guitar. Flash to my mother handing me a package. With devious furiosity I tore into it with my teeth, knowing what to expect. Fuck! It was random plants. Where was my dxm? I awoke to my mother standing over me handing me a small light box. Here it was! The moment I\'ve been waiting for. Ten grams of pure ass dextromethorphan.     I could barely wait. I darted to the store and picked up some low budget vitamins and emptied a few capsules. Little did I even step in my house before I began filling capsule after capsule with the sacred snow. Hours later and I discovered what was soon to be the beginning of my most insane psychedelic adventure yet. At roughly nine pm on Saturday, the dex was in full force, bullet to the dome, lock and load. Fresh clip. Down the hatch and whoa what the fuzzy fuck? The world was a mess of colored static and perceptual alterations. This quickly led to a comatose state in which a dreamless sleep dominated.     The next day I awoke to another full cap, roughly 500 mg after the day before\'s estimated 900 or more mg. Still tripping utter sack, I downed the bastard at about 1 pm. not too much later I was setting sail on yet another chemical crusade to eternity. Ringing! Am I hallucinating or is something happening? I took another cap bringing me to about 800 mg or roughly 1200 mg for the day on top of 900 mg the day before. The phone! Yes, of course. Just cuz I was dissociated from reality doesnt mean the rest of the world was. I swiftly picked the motherfucker up. My friends were down on a vision quest. I agreed and packed my bags.    As soon as they arrived I showed them what wonders were in store. My friends were prepared also but not in the way that they shouldve been. They had some Peruvian torch and I had in my bags, a fear and loathing backpack of ethereal madness. there contained three pounds of mescal ridden Peruvian torch cacti, 500 Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, 1 oz high caliber amanita pantherina caps, 1 oz nutmeg extract, and 2 oz amanita muscaria. This is not all however. There also contained 4 oz wormwood dust, seven grams dagga flowers, and a small quantity of schwag herbal. Yes, we were ready to explore. Needless to say, we didnt touch much but the dxm. My friends quickly downed a 500 mg cap of pure dex and I followed suit as well. This made 2200 mg for today.     Before I even left the house my other cap had begun hitting me hard and I was finding it hard to speak and socialize, but it could be carried out with little effort. We spent the next hour smoking shitty buds and making small talk. I tried to sell my homies dad some drugs to which he declined. Pussy. Dude was just drinking tequila, Satans water. He talked shit saying how we were insane and he was going to call the loony bin, so off we went. My buddys girl was left behind and we three cruised up the mountain into the dark woods. Daylight had begun to fade. We ended up taking more like an hour later. 2/3 cap was taken by me as the other two had hit me like a freight train. 2800 mg today. We all sat speechless staring at the fire for what seemed like hours before I went home to pass out in a coma style dreamless slumber.    I stirred from death at 12 pm only to take another cap. Day three and I was still fazed the fuck out from the leftovers of yesterdays. 500 mg for the day. Went to college and strained to pay attention. I noticed that it took much effort to do what was previously simple on amanitas a few days earlier. Much less harmony. I was all in my own head. But somehow I understood. Odd, I thought. My mom picked me up to eat Chinese but first we went to the bank. I packed up another capsule in the bank bathroom at about 3:00 tripping utter sack. It was a little struggle but nada mucho. Downed and chilled. I noticed the swift come on and felt like I was in a psychedelic dream. I was more in control than I ever felt before.    3:15, in the Chinese place bathroom, I retardedly filled yet ANOTHER cap, insisting that more would be better. In my daze I had not thought of my previous experiences and forgot how powerful dexxx really is. The food tasted amazing and I remember social skillz excelling. Visuals and euphoria were blatant and abundant. Conversations were profound and I thought briefly about how much smarter cookies are than me. Laugh to self.    Then it began to take a turn for the worst. I think all the dxm had finally hit me on the ride home. Talking felt like I had a dead tongue and I began to fully dissociate. It was only 4:20 and I was reaching anesthetic levels, nothing short of wondrous sigma. I couldnt think. I sat in dead silence with my mom talking about random shit in the background. everything I was looked like those prismatic glasses you can buy at rave shops that give sober lames a twisted view into the madness a tripper may experience but this was far more fut. Distortions abound and I couldnt think about anything but how I felt like crystal death.    The second I got home I pounded a drink and lay the fuck down on the ground to die. I placed some gems on my solar plexus and had a bizarre lucid experience of which I remember little other than leaving my body and soaring the world. I could feel pulsing from the gems and later (8:00) rose and decided to abolish my chemical abduction with a little natural medicine. 15 hbwr(India strain) seeds were ground and consumed along with 8 amanita pantherina (mad potent) caps, roughly 1 inch to 3 inches each, drier than Egypts sands. Bold move, which would later seal my fate.    I lay down once more and soon began to feel sober but the strange thing is my visual activity began to swirl and pulsate like nothing I had ever felt before. I perceived extreme energy and strength and soon got up. I said whats up to my stepdad and he laughed saying something about how he couldnt understand me. I felt sketched out, grabbed my backpack of drugs, and went back into the other room. I felt ashamed of not being able to handle my trips properly and realized this was self importance and soon my trip regained the euphoria it had earlier.    The trip intensified to magnificent levels and I soon seen visions of vivid neon color, eyes open, quickly intensifying in speed and strangeness until I believed I peaked at midnight. I lay there hearing insane noises and I thought I had lost it. I felt retarded and feared never coming back. The psychedelics were doing whatever they wanted and I had little say. I could intervene but I quickly noticed that doing so dulled the realizations. It was like going psychotic but being a genius at the same time. The trips were battling for control but merging as one spectacular entity in their warfare. I remember being disassembled and then reassembled many times that night. I did all sorts of strange things like talking repetitive words to myself, compulsively moving about and writhing in my bed, and realizing deep things about the world I lived in and myself. I remember voices saying sometimes inane things like spring-gibbledy-boing-ding to is this thing broken to things like full blown songs from grateful dead like I will survive.    At around 3 am the seeds hit harder and the shit turned dreamy and tired. I lay still hallucinating wildly until I was awakened. It was early morning, 6:30 am. I had survived the night. I felt tired but wise beyond my years and did a little yoga and ninja meditation to raise my energy. I ate 2 more pantherinas and took ginseng and ginkgo, three pills each. I felt synched up in harmony with myself and the world and was ready to rock. I got to school with little effort and made it thru class with much distraxion. A French vanilla (yum) cappuccino was slaughtered and here I sit at 11:30 am on a college computer. Weirdest and greatest fucking trip of my life. I wanted guidance and I got it. My horoscope today is this:     CANCER     (Jun 23 - Jul 23)     Think of the waning moon as your friend in a helicopter - surveying the landscape of your life from a lofty height. It can see the road ahead in much greater clarity than you can - even if it isn\'t fully cognizant of all the immediate detail. It knows, though, where you need to go and is letting you know clearly, which way to turn - or not to turn. This is why you feel as if you are being pushed around by circumstance at the moment. You are, to some extent - but even those irritating circumstances are steering you the right way     True as fuck. I may take a little more dxm when I get home but am unsure yet. I think I have direction now and I now am certain what I am: nothing and everything. That is what I was last night and that is what I will always be. Life is meant to be lived and thats what I\'m going to do. Peace and love."
31022,Strange Ladies,Pry3rdeye,"Nov 13, 2007","LSD, H.B. Woodrose, & Gabapentin (Neurontin)","So this last weekend I had the house to myself and I decided to have some friends over for the weekend. My parents were paying me to watch over my dog while they were out of town, so I figured hey why not have a little fun. At school the previous week I had purchased two hits of some so-so blotter called dragons, although I never saw any sort of dragon on the paper so I\'m sort of just thinking they made up the name. I had had an experience with one hit of this stuff prior and had a very mild not so mind blowing trip. I figured two hits would give me a better time. I popped the hits at around six while sitting with my friend Gregg. Whenever I dose I always have doubts about the acids potency or even overall actuality of it being real. But I try to let these thoughts go as not to somehow diminish my trip. After about a half hour I decided to eat five Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. I was curious as to how the ergot compounds played off each other. I sat back and let the drugs take hold.    At about an hour I was noticing the acid a little, it was a very slow come on and by this time I was starting to feel some nausea from the seeds. My friend Jason called around this time and told me he was coming over to buy some adderall. I told him just head over anytime. While waiting for him I started to get very energized and nervous. I just wanted to get the deal over so I could enjoy my trip. I started pacing around my house. Running into everything feeling somewhat intoxicated. My friend Gregg was just sitting there and we were trying to discuss things but my mind was drifting and I knew I wouldnt be able to make any sense. I sat down on the floor and my dog came over and I looked in her eyes and I swear to god I could communicate with her. I felt she knew something was different about me and she obeyed my commands in an uncanny fashion.     After that Jason came over, he wanted twenty addies. I had the hardest time counting them out and had to let Gregg do it for me. After all was figured out I got really ancy because I didnt know what to do with myself and the hallucinogens were really starting to effect my perception. There were faces bubbled outward and morphed I could see fractally patterns seeming to tie their faces together. I started pacing frantically. I couldnt make eye contact with either of them and I just started babbling about everything that was on my mind. I couldnt stop moving. My friend Gregg urged me to just sit down but I couldnt. My friend Jason said he had some downers if I wanted any, but I had never heard of them. He called them neurontins and said hey had done some research on them and that they were legit. Trusting him I took two 300mg caps and just waited.    I felt a little calmer and I decided I wanted to smoke a bowl. We all went out on my porch it was really cold out and I was shivering. I took several hits holding them in for a very long time it seemed, and when I exhaled I felt like my lungs were collapsing. The snow and the shadows of the night were warping and dancing. I felt really alone. That no one knew what I was seeing and thinking. We finished it and Jason took off. I kept thinking I freaked the shit out of him. At this time I had chilled out enough to watch a movie. Or at least try. Bad idea. We started watching Half Baked, but I couldnt follow it. I felt like I couldnt even look directly at the screen because it was too bright and the screen was bulging out and swirling.    I looked away, constantly staring at the ceiling and the walls. They were breathing heavily. My field of vision started to tunnel and my peripheral vision started patterning but if I tried to look at it would disappear. Then things started to get really strange. this sounds totally bizarre and I still cant fully explain it. From the fractally patterns which resembled groups of linking numbers started \'reaching\' into my mind. Vivid pictures started to penetrate my third eye. I started seeing images of middle aged women, very average looking, overweight in some cases. They were moving but standing in front of some kind of white wall. It looked as if they were being videotaped or photographed by someone who I couldnt see. I couldnt figure out what they were doing there.    I started to think they were actually in my house. The images were not scary but the breach from reality and the emergence of the unconcious psyche startled me, where did these people come from? Why was I seeing them? The faces were not familiar at all and it started freaking me out. No one knew what I was seeing and I couldnt describe it accurately. My friend Dan came over and I tried to tell him what was happening but he seemed not to know what to do. I felt completely psychotic. I couldnt erase or evade the images. They were permeating every corner of my conciousness. I started to become terrified. I curled up into a ball on the couch and just tried to relax. They still remained in my mind and I felt like I was floating. Then I felt like I weighed a ton and my head felt extremely heavy. I just wanted to go to sleep.    Later on my friend Sean came and pretty much as soon as he walked in I was fine. I was still seeing visuals but the \'lysergic ladies\' were starting to fade from my visual/mental field. I started babbling to him on and on about what happened. he seemed genuinely interested where as the others did not. we went in my hot tub and I mellowed out and drank some beers. the surface of the bubbling water was extremely psychadelic. We talked and smoked a few bowls of some really good organic pot and I felt so relaxed and open. I felt as if I had penetrated something and then came back to a reasonable level. Its just odd that when he got there I felt so much better.    The rest of the night was awesome. It was mostly a body trip but I was seeing some visuals at times. I\'ve squeeged my self for a while and I dont think Ill be taking seeds for quite some time. Also after researching gabapentin which is what neurontin is I dont know if I really want to take anti seizure meds. I dont have seizures. Ill do acid again. I mean I\'ve done it alot and I love it, but the seeds can turn on you I think. That and they make me nauseaus."
36685,Herbal High Experience,Druid\'s Fantasy,"Nov 10, 2007","Commerical Herbal Mix (Morning Glory, H.B. Woodrose, Calamus & Kava) & Cannabis","Setting: Quiet night in  These capsules claim to produce an effect similar to that of magic mushrooms.    10.00pm  Took one capsule on an empty stomach. Very heavily under the influence of cannabis.    10.30pm  Took two more capsules.    11.00pm  Nothing had yet happened. Cannabis consumption continued.    12.00am  Still no effects.    12.30am  Still no effects. Ceased smoking cannabis.    01.15am  Ever so slight trailing(*) of lights.    01.30am  Sleepiness set in. Think this was due to the cannabis rather than the capsules    (*)Trailing, as I mean it, is in the same sense as if someone waves a glowstick past your face when you\'re on MDMA. Only this was nowhere near as pronounced as it is on MDMA.    Since that night I tried again with a full dose. I had not been smoking cannabis. They had no effect whatsoever. I do not have sufficient knowledge to propose whether or not there was an interaction between the capsules and the cannabis the first time, or whether cannabis consumption increases/decreases the effects.    I wouldn\'t bother buying them again, I can get a fresh portion of shrooms for the same price anyway!"
35590,Tripping on my Reflection,Hash Burns,"Nov 7, 2007",H. B. Woodrose & Alcohol,"Had my first experience with H.B. Woodrose last night.  It is a pretty intense trip, not so full on as acid, but still wicked fun (and much easier to get also!)      On an empty stomach (3 hours since I last ate) and completely sober I ate half a metoclopramide tablet, a very effective anti-nausea drug 30mins before eating the crushed up seeds.  It was about 8 when I ate the crushed seeds, washed down with a bit of water.  They tasted pretty good to me, just like cracked pepper.  They took along time to take effect, and come on slowly as they do.  I sat around watching a rugby game on T.V. with some other guys. I just wasn\'t interested, and the yelling and the noise of the commentary was really irritating. I wanted to do something more mellow.    Fortunately I went off to a party with a good friend who was not on woodrose and the walk there calmed me down a bit.  There was a little bit of nasuea for the first hour but by the time we walking my appetite had come back.  My mood picked up on the 30 minute walk and when we arrived (about 9:30) the trip came on strong, as soon as Soph opened the door.  The visuals initially weren\'t that strong but I felt a bit strange and euphoric.  Socializing was a bit of struggle, cause I was the only one at the party drugged up so I had retrain myself from talking too much weird shit.  At times, it felt a bit like ecstasy, because touching my head and neck felt really good, and talking one-on-one with people is a good experience, and I could really \'see\' the emotion in people.      The best parts of my trip was when I went to the bathroom, where I would stare at my own reflection and trip out, letting my mind run free and turning my features into a wolf or asian face.  But I always felt that sense of control, so I knew if things were getting to out of hand I could pull myself back to reality.  I spent alot of time in there I think, and only left cause I felt guilty about hogging it from needy bladders.    I didn\'t drink much over the night, a few beers, some punch, and wine, but only maybe 6 or 7 drinks in total which really had no effect at all, except I was very dehydrated today.  Should of had some water somewhere along the way.  When the vibe at the party got a bit bitchy toward me, I went for a walk down the lane on my own.  It was cool and tripping can be fun on my own because I don\'t have to concentrate on a conversation or other people, and am free to let my mind free and think.  Overall, I was in a cheery mood, and got on well with most people I met (I knew hardly no-one at this party) but I think it could be more fun to do with a few friends around to watch out for each other, and laugh at interesting patterns.      The party started winding down about 1pm.  And me and my friend left with a few others to go out at about 2pm.  I ordered a red bull which was good to bring me back up to tripping and sat there on a couch watching the lights above the dance floor till me and Chris left about 3pm.  Quick walk home and we sat up watching TV (infomercials) till about 4:30, would of slept well, but very cold.      Today I felt good in spite of only having slept 5 hours.  It was a beautiful day, and I\'ve been on walks, played some soccer, and have been very contemplative, and I can still a feel a bit of the trip factor in my system.  Noooo comedown at all (real bitch with just about everything else...)    MORE FACTS....  Like LSD, it is a looooonnnnggg trip.  So I was very glad I took it at 8.  Cause it lasted for about 7 hours.  I made the mistake of taking acid at 11pm once, big mistake! But sleeping isn\'t as difficult on H.Woodrose, because I feel more mellow most of the time, it is a bit like being stoned when I am talking to people and playing it straight."
29108,Underrated,Phlawed,"Nov 1, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Herbal Cigarettes,"I have done LSD and MDMA more times than I can remember and have never had a bad experience with either. Oh, and my mind is still here. I\'m a junior in medical technology and was a meteorologist for four years. I am a naturally happy guy, so thats how my trips, rolls, and trollings go. I will injest 7 (lucky 7 for the first time) HBWR seeds partially crushed soaked in CoolAid for app. 30 min.    5:30 p.m. Ate four hours ago at Mickey D\'s. Will use smokes and herbs for possible nausea or other problems. 1 min till injestion and I\'m off. That 70\'s show is starting so I should have some good laughs prior to impact of anything. Always a good thing. I also have a dog. Pets are the best when tripping. Always make me happy. All seven are down. Chewed them up good and washed down with more coolaid. Getting glass pipe and bowl ready with legal herbs. Going with Vision Quest herbal smoke. 3/4 pack of cigs, all set.    6:00 p.m. Nothing much yet. Still way too soon. Most things take around 1 hr to fully start kicking in for me so I\'m good. No nausea or any problems like that yet. Feels like something is coming on, but still not for sure. Would also like to say its been over two years since I have done XTC or acid. So don\'t remember some of the feelings. But, an upset stomach usually meant some good stuff. Still not upset much at all. Think I\'m starting to feel some effects. A little faster than expected. May just be excitement of trying the first time still.     6:30 p.m. Definitely feeling the body high. No signs of puking or wanting to. Just the average stomach saying get ready for this. May skip a few hours or something if I get caught up with something else. But, generally a very good comfortable feeling right now. Similar to coming up on XTC. This stuff seems to be really good. No sickness or anything. Great body high right now. Gonna start some incents and will check back soon. I\'m gonna grow some of these. They seem great. I\'m walking really slow, so I know this is some good stuff.     7:10 p.m. Wow, this stuff is good. All body right now. Almost identical to XTC. Decided to watch Dazed and Confused for the music and stuff. Great choice with my surround sound. Not once did I feel like throwing up or anything like that. Starting to feel somewhat incitefull like if on acid. But, not going to say anything like that yet. We will see where it leads. Mind is starting to work faster than fingers. That\'s always a good thing. Wow, body feels like jello. Walking is just a blast. Very slow, drawn out walks are the best feeling. Got my Pink Floyd Cd\'s lade out and ready once movie ends. If I can wait that long:)    7:30 p.m. Having to type slow here. Walking around the house is awsome. Still no visuals. Looked in mirror and pupals dialated. Believe me, if I had visuals, I would still be at the mirror. That was the coolest thing with acid. But, this is awsome for legal. Very awsome. Going to try some herb and see if that helps anything. This is great stuff alone. Damn. Damn. What can I say but, Damn! Everything I pick up feels weightless. But, throwing is chore let me tell ya. Dog wanted to play fetch and tug of war, didn\'t happen LOL. Smoking some Vision Quest herb was great. Great taste and aroma, much better than cigs. Although all drugs require cigs to get the good effects in my opinion. Wow, what I would do for a full body message. That would be ecstacy! Music is great at this point. This is becoming a long report. Maybe I should just right a book on this. Just joking LOL.    8:11 p.m. This will be the last update for awhile. I\'m just going to truly enjoy this great feeling. Queen is a great choice of music right now. Music is very enhanced. I know its louder than I think right now. But the vibes are great. A truly wonderful natural high. This is almost like trolling (mixing LSD and MDMA). Still no amazing visuals. But, I feel this is only the beginning of something great.     9:15 p.m. This stuff is great. Pretty good trailers, and visuals seem to be really starting to increase. Overall the body high almost identical to acid. Music and sounds are truly enhanced. Even more amazing, my dog seems to be feeding off my high. Has an unusual amount of energy for this late at night. Very enhanced taste and smell much like acid. I\'m not getting that dehydration feel most get. If anything, I feel I don\'t want anything to drink. Got some gatorade and drank some of it just to give me a little something. Don\'t want to dehydrate. That would be bad. WOW. this stuff is amazing for being legal. Maybe its just been awhile since I felt this good or something. I\'m not for sure. But, WOW!    Time seems to be standing still. That is so great. Visuals really starting to kick in good. Why does it seem you only post the bad trips. This stuff is great. Now the feeling is almost identical to LSD. Wow, it\'s been awhile! this is great. I\'m so happy I tried this. There is one odd thing. Stomach seems to want food, but I don\'t. Wierd.    12:15 Still having a great trip. Installing Tony Hawk 2 to play. We use to play that for hours on the PS1. So this should be fun. This stuff is truly an amazing substance. No hard peek or anything and seem to feel a little drained but still have very much in state of tripping. Very enjoyable and fulfilled with this product. This has to be the closest thing to the real LSD I have ever heard of. During all my days with X and LSD, I don\'t ever recall hearing about HBWR. Just ran across a few things on the internet looking up MJ substitutes. I feel this is a very underated product. I was not expecting to be tripping this hard this steady at such a great state of mind. Have seen very good visuals. Looked into a light outside while walking the dog and the light stayed with me for about 5 minutes and I could see a green face in the middle of the light that was following me. Very wierd but very very cool. Had a hot pocket to eat and feel very satisfied and no problems what so ever.    1:30 Starting to come down. Very smooth comedown. May just go lay down. I feel it will be very good to just relax a bit. Probably wont go to sleep right off. But, still feel great so thats fine with me.    2:00 Went to sleep fine with no problems. Laid down and just relaxed for about 30-45 minutes and then I was out like a light. I have been very impressed with this. Comedown was much smother than X and close to that of LSD but much slower. Very, very impressive product."
26620,Mood Assignment,Paranoid Android,"Oct 17, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"Mind altering substances have always fascinated me.  While I can\'t call myself an experienced tripper, I have dabbled in things like mushrooms, dxm, and of course cannabis.  Of those, my first shroom trip proved to be one of the greatest nights of my life, save for the stomach pains and strange physical sensations.  I\'d familiarized myself with the effects of LSA a long while ago and have always been curious to try it, but until recently had lived at home and was too paranoid about ordering any.  However, I moved into my own place about a month ago and in my boredom last weekend decided to order some HWBR seeds.    They arrived on Thursday after work and it was my intention to use them to provide a different Friday night experience than usual (i.e. not drinking). My first impression was that they were a lot smaller than I had imagined.  \'I only have to eat 5-10 of these?  That\'s not so bad,\' I thought. So I packed them away in a safe little space in my closet and went about my typical post-work activities.  But I was intrigued and wanted to just try a little, maybe one or two seeds figuring it would be mild and would at least give me a taste of what to expect.  I decided, after reading the subligual report, that three seeds crushed and held in my mouth with some water would provide just a nice sample of LSA\'s effects.  So I did just that.    I held the three seeds under my tongue for a good half an hour and then spit them out.  About an 15 minutes later I felt a slight stoned-type feeling, nothing profoud, but perceptions were definitely altered and I was intrigued.  \'What\'s the harm in taking taking two more, sublingually?\' I reasoned with myself.  With a shrug, I prepared two more seeds in the same manner as before and held them in my mouth for about half an hour.  But then the urge came over me to just swallow and with a gulp, the tiny seed pieces were in my stomach.  This is when things got interesting.    A few minutes later I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded, music sounded good, and I noticed a slight upward swing in my mood.  This feeling strengthened in intensity for a little while but wasn\'t too intense.  \'Eh, what\'s one more going to do?\' my already slightly tripping mind questioned.  So I ate one more and soon after was feeling slight nausea and disorientation.  I knew at that moment that the impending trip was about to be a lot more intense than I had originally bargained for.      To fight the nausea and mild stomach discomfort I ate a couple of antacids and layed down.  At one point I felt the urge to throw up without really having the urge to (let\'s just say it wasn\'t overwhelming but if I so chose to, I could have hurled) and headed to the bathroom just to be safe.  About twenty minutes later I knew I was tripping.  Colors were brighter, almost like a mild mushroom trip.  My thoughts were racing and I felt delirious. Best of all, my nausea was gone and only very mild stomach discomfort remained.    The rest of the night was spent enjoying the trip, the feelings, the thoughts, the sensations.  A few things I really enjoyed:  First, I felt euphoric, joyous, probably the best I\'d ever felt.  There was also a physical sensation almost akin the pleasant anxiety and ache I feel when on speed.  Music was great and different.  I heard things in songs I\'d never heard before.  Sexual response was greatly impaired but despite this, without going into gory detail, I had some of the most intense sexual experiences of my life.  Though I couldn\'t cum to save my life, I was having multiple orgasms that were extremely intense.  And perhaps one of the best things about the trip was that I could assign a mood to anything.  For example, if I thought back on a good event in the past I would instantly feel like I did back then. Any situation I was in would be transformed, mood-wise, into a pleasant visit to the past.     All in all, I really underestimated the potency of these little seeds.  The trip was positive and very enjoyable for almost the whole duration.  However, I found it extremely hard to sleep (it lasted around 6-7 hours or so) and ended up staying up all night watching movies.  Somehow I feel changed, but I know I\'m still the same.  I feel like I went on a week-long vacation and am now left to reminisce and decipher what happened while I was gone. I feel refreshed."
26533,Recognizing Raindrops,Jens,"Oct 17, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"I am 16 yrs. old, 190cm tall weighing about 55 kg. I\'ve been meditating since I was nine. This was my first experience with hallucinogens. Alcohol just fucks up my balance, and hemp has no effect on me worth mentioning. I ate six seeds shortly after dinner. I took a piece of ginger first, to avoid nausea. That trick might have worked since I experienced no nausea whatsoever, but I usually don\'t get nausea anyway.    After about half an hour, I decided to go to the city: There was a giant street party with more than twenty bands performing on several stages. One of my friend was there and I wanted someone to sit by just in case. There was still no profound effect as I sat in the bus. I noticed the colors seemed more beautiful, and my fantasy slowly started playing with all the shadows and reflections. As I arrived and tried to contact my friend, my cell phone went dead. I didn\'t really care anymore since I was getting preoccupied with the lights, sounds and the sparks from the giant bonfire.     The following couple of hours I spent enjoying the scenery, walking around between people as the amount of real hallucinations increased. After a while, it was getting more and more difficult to see things from far away. People turned to siluets, voices, beats, rythms and other fragments from the music blended together and entered my vision, making patterns and surfaces I could almost feel in my body. I lost my sense of near and far. For a while, I lost awareness of everything else altogether, a stream of pictures, shapes, colors flowing before my eyes. And finally all I could see was a green ring broken in four places.    At this point I managed to get a grip on myself; I thrusted my umbrella into the ground, and sat down on the spot. I must\'ve looked really funny. At this point I was seriously afraid of going crazy, dying or worse. Somehow I managed to walk over and sit down on something, leaning my head onto a white surface. As I looked onto the surface, I realized it was sprinkled with raindrops. I don\'t think I\'ve ever been as happy in my entire life, than when I recognized (consider that word) those raindrops.    Then I slowly started putting things back together. I repeated for myself, that the sun would rise again, and I would somehow manage. It seemed to work. Soon I knew that I was sitting on some sort of trailer. And after a while I recognized the restaurant I was sitting in front of. As I started to walk homeward, I felt in love with everyone and everything in the entire world. I was sooo happy to be alive. I managed to control my hallucinations from that point, but my sense of time was still extremely distorted. I thought I had waited for the for an hour but when I checked my watch, only three minutes had gone by.    My attitude towards life has changed, and I have learned a thing or two about reality. Although it was a very frightening experience, I do not regret it. I might even try it again under different circumstances. I\'ve planted one of the seeds in my room; I don\'t know if I\'ll ever use it for anything, but its a nice way to commemorate something I\'ll never forget."
24874,Happiness and Panic,Bullsquid,"Oct 12, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Me and some friends were home at my place and we had decided to try HBW. I am 18 years old and this was the first time I\'ve done any psychadelic drug. Me and another guy took the seeds and put in our mouth raw, started chewing. The taste wasn\'t so bad that I had been told. It kinda reminded of nuts. I ate 9 seeds and the other guy 5. Then we sat and waited for the effects to start.    The other guy started to feel sickness and when we went outside he started to puke. I didn\'t feel any sickness at all just feeling kinda weird in a way that I can\'t really explain. We want back to my place again and started to watch a movie. I then began to feel very sleepy so I sat in the bed and almost fell asleep. This was about 2 and a half hour after I had eaten the seeds.    Suddenly I woke up at once with a rush trough my whole body and mind. The world had suddenly changed and I remember touching every surface including my friends shirt cause I felt everything was so beautiful and so very different to touch. I felt I just had to go outside to explore it further. The other guy that were feeling sick before now went home so it was just me and 2 other friends and we went to the store in a nearby gas station.    When I went inside the lights and different smells gave me a complete rush of happiness and everything just seemed beautiful. We then went home to one of my friends and I remember lying in his bed and feeling so extremely happy. I tried to tell them how wonderful it felt but I couldn\'t make out any words.    After around 40-50 mins we decided to go back to my place. This is where I began to trip real intense. In the elevator my friend\'s bodys seemed warped and their faces were all messed up. I didn\'t feel good so I laid down in the bed. Then I began hallucinate real hard. My body felt like liquid and I had very unpleasant hallucinations of my eyes feeling wet all the time and when I tried to dry them with my fingers it just dissapeared and then came back. I told the other friends to leave me and only one of them who had tried HBW before should stay and try to calm me down cause now I was tripping so hard I could barely tell what was real.    I was really loosing it. At this stage I was yelling \'Help! I don\'t know what\'s real anymore!\' At this point my mom who had been home the whole time heard me and come in and wondered what was going on. She realised I had taken some kind of drugs and was yelling at me. I finally made her leave the room and my friend tried again to calm me down, which surely wasn\'t easy.    I wasn\'t sure of where I was and who I was and I couldn\'t keep my eyes open. My friend told me this was only temporarily and would wear off in a couple of hours. But I could not focus on the aspect of time anymore. How long was a minute or a hour? I couldn\'t tell. I wasn\'t sure if I was talking or only thinking. It seemed like I had been there in the bed for days. Bad waves of fear and paranoia was filling my poor mind. What I experienced felt like it would go on forever and I could not take it anymore, I just wanted to be normal again.    After what seemed endless I was finally beginning to come down. I was back in reality more or less. Later on I could feel it wearing off and just layed in the bed talking to my friend. Eventually I felt like I was going to sleep but I was still hallucinating some. After maybe 10-20 min I felt sick and went to the bathroom to puke. After that I felt much better and could finally go to sleep.    I would not try these seeds again, they were too much for me. Next time I will just eat a small dose mushrooms for a milder trip. I didn\'t want anything so intense. The worst part was that I felt extreme horror and panic which seemed endless."
29064,What Happened?,DK Nera,"Oct 3, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"I was so excited upon receiving my mail order HBW seeds.  I waited to finish my classes that day to begin ingesting them. I figured that since the trip supposedly lasts from 6-8 hours, I would have enough time to come down and go to sleep and wake up for class the next day. My room was dim and quiet. I decided to start with 6 seeds. I scraped and flamed off the hairs on the coat as best I could. I began chewing them and held them in my mouth for about 10 minutes, then swallowed.    I didn\'t feel anything, not even the popularly-claimed nausea. After an hour, I was somewhat disappointed. Since I had read reports of peple taking up to 14 seeds, I came to the conclusion that I simply hadn\'t eaten enough. So, I ate 4 more seeds. Still nothing; no nausea or hints of a trip coming. About a half an hour later, I was convinced that I still hadn\'t ingested enough, so I ate 4 more seeds.  Still, nothing. So, another fifteen minutes later, I ate 5 more seeds.    Well, that\'s a total of 19 seeds. I didn\'t feel a thing. I\'m really disappointed. Maybe it\'s just the company I ordered from. But, I believe the trips are definitely possible! Just maybe I did something wrong, or I have a bad source. Good Luck!"
22999,"A Mellow, Easy Buzz",T-Moe,"Oct 3, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I just tried HBW for the first time and had a positive experience, so I hope the things I learned can be of value to others. I\'m in my mid-twenties, with pretty broad experience in most drugs, though my tastes run almost exclusively to MJ and booze, with occasional (i.e. once or twice a year) psychedelic voyages facilitated by entheogens like psilocybin mushrooms or LSD. Wanting to try something new, I researched HBW and decided to give it a try, buying seeds online.     First I chose a good time to dose- it was a beautiful Sunday morning in the spring, I had no pressing responsibilities to attend to and I had the whole day to myself. Furthermore, I was in good mental/physical/spiritual health and ready for a new experience, so I prepared a drink from nine HBW seeds. Here\'s what I did:    1. Scrape the seeds with knife, removing as much of the brown, woolly matter as possible, so the seed looks white. This fuzz is the stuff that will irritate your stomach.    2. Fill a jar with warm water, soak seeds for two hours    3. Remove seeds, try to scrape away any lingering brown fuzz (it\'s easier after they\'ve been soaking), then crush seeds to a pulp with mortar and pestle. Needlenose pliers or a hammer will work, too.     4. Take pulp, put in jar with water, shake vigorously a few times. The water will turn brown-green. Drink the whole thing and relax.     DOSAGE NOTE: I\'m a lean 6\'3 and 190 lbs., I work out regularly, have a quick metabolism and a sensitive stomach. I took the nine seeds on an empty stomach and found it was a good dose for me, especially for my first time.     The mixture didn\'t taste that bad, but it didn\'t taste that great, either. So I sat back, put on some tunes and took a couple bong rips, for both pleasure and to help with the nausea. After about 30-45 minutes my stomach rumbled. I felt nauseated enough to think that at any minute I\'d be running for the bathroom to hurl my guts out, but I closed my eyes, relaxed and pulled it together. After a few minutes, the nausea got better, so I drank some water took a soothing bong rip and my stomach returned to calm.  The nausea passes and never comes back. The effects came slowly. After an hour or two, I noticed a definite change, though nothing major: a mellow, full-body tingle and altered perceptions, especially where time and space were concerned. I tried watching a basketball game on TV but found it too hard to follow, even though I\'m a fan of the game. Relaxing, listening to music and sitting outside on the porch by the trees was the best thing to do.     At three hours the effects plateaued and I thought that was it, the experiment failed. I\'m glad I was wrong. Suddenly at the fourth hour, the stuff really kicked in: I had a wonderful mind trip very similar to a mild dose of good LSD, but with a surprising burst of energy I hadn\'t experienced with any other psychedelics. I felt calm, serene and full of vigor all at once, stoned and full of piss and vinegar.  After a while, I walked in the park  through the grass and trees, enjoying the beautiful spring day. The effects tapered off after a couple more hours, so the total trip time was about eight hours, though I felt a few lingering effects into the ninth, tenth and even eleventh hours.     SUMMARY: This was an excellent experience- a mellow, easy buzz, similar to a mild dose of good LSD. It lasted about eight hours, with an onset of about one hour and the peak hitting after 4 hours. There was some initial nausea, but it\'s not that bad and it passes. Cannabis goes very well with HBW, it kicks off the trip and calms the stomach."
49737,"Evil Horror, but I\'ll Do Them Again",Chucky,"Sep 29, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Having experienced much of what shrooms, salvia, nitrous, and other less pleasant psychedelics (Peganum Harmala -Uggeh) have to offer, I bought some of these seeds as a cheaper, legal substitute for LSD. I should have known it was a bad idea at the specific time, a friday night, after a pretty emotional day as my much beloved cat was showing signs of deterioration; it was clear he was soon to die. Especially bad for a first timer, I suppose. I took 15 seeds around 7.00 in the evening, having microwaved them in a small cup of water for around 30 seconds, then chewing them up and downing. Not at all a bad taste compared to some of the shit I\'ve ingested. Basically I thought \'Well I hope they don\'t work\'. I\'d had dud seeds before.    The nausea I\'d expected came in maybe 40mins-1hr from ingestion. I was sitting cradling my cat, comforting him in his suffering. He had a bad infection/rot in the head/eye. I suppose the nausea was slightly trippy in itself, it lasted for around 2 and a half hours, and my emotional anxiety grew with the physical hurt, the two eventually seeming to meld. It took increasing effort to sit and tend to my cat, with breaks of lying flat on my bed, feeling horrible physically and emotionally. I felt moronic and selfish to have taken these when my cat needed me, on top of the nausea.     Well after this, which truly was bad enough, the nausea gradually faded, to be replaced by a hugely intense trip of agony. I experienced a feeling that had been growing through the nausea, that I was feeling my cat\'s real pain. Almost physical empathy. This grew to titanic proportions as the trip came on, like my personal hurt mixed with received agony of my cat next to me. I just burned. Then at a crest of one such wave, my cat walked out of my room and I was sure as hell he\'d gone off to die. The next 4-5 hours were some of the worst I\'ve ever been through. I\'d guess it was around 11.30 when he left. I had the lights off and wanted to sleep. ha.    I, at that point with my shroom \'evolution\', had the concept of there being love at the heart, the centre of everything. That love is beneath even the darkest sorrow, the worst hate etc., and the thing is to reach it. Well I think the reason the seed trip fucked me so badly is that, while experiencing this extremely intense horror, I searched and searched, probing deeper it seemed into existence itself, trying to reach the source, where I would find, I thought, the love that binds everything. And I just couldn\'t find it. This vein of darkness went on forever, and the sense of hopelessness at this destroyed me.     On the physical level, I was constantly grimacing and grinding my teeth hard, while it felt like my eyelids had turned up on themselves. My eyes were fixed at the \'third eye\' position, rolled up. I writhed in pure agony that went from my lower back, up through my body to my upper chest. It was absolutely unbearable. This was as real physical pain as anything. It occurred to me through this hell that this was like cold turkey, though I have no personal experience of that. I moaned softly throughout. Regarding hallucinations, at one point when I rarely had my eyes \'down\', my hands seemed to have strands of flesh between them like goo, they stretched as a parted my hands. Wierd.      So I continued through this tunnel of hell trying to find the end of love, and never doing so. the deeper I went the worse it was. And for hours it was the same, the thought of the imminent death of my cat repeatedly sending me into spasms of, well, hell. I must have slept around 4-5ish, and woke around half 11, still not down. Lying still I could bear this state. I was crying silently at what I had witnessed in the night, but getting up and moving, as I needed to do to help my parents administer ointment to my cat, who hadn\'t died that night, but soon would. It was nauseous torture. I couldn\'t see or walk, a bit like whitying on weed, and it took a burning will and love for my cat to get myself down stairs and hold my cat. I just wanted the whole thing to go away. I felt a level of apathy to the entire world. I felt the horror revealed to me in the night was universal. Hope was an alien concept. I guess I was fully down by 12.30 so round 16-17 hours for the entire experience.    Now, some 7 months later, I\'ll try them again because I see it was the set and setting that had me trip sooo badly. And, in a twisted way it was a valuable experience. Also I\'ll do half the dosage, I think 15 was too many."
18806,Like Nintendo-MTV,ChrisOfTheDark,"Aug 29, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"The other evening I took HBWR for the first time. I have taken MGs three times before, but only in low doses and never had an experience like this. The best experience with MGs was slight visual distortion. Aside from that, I have taken MDMA twice (enjoyed it immensely both times) and smoked weed lots in the last 2 years (every day for a year, although I\'m smokin\' less now). I decided to take HBWR as I am interested in psycadelic drugs, both as a novel experience and to understand myself and others better - enlightenment and wisdom.    I took them at home, with my g/f as a sitter, on a weekday evening. I was feeling happy, relaxed, and contented with life. At 5pm I crushed 5 seeds with pliers, after first removing the fuzzy coating. I put these on bread and ate it. At 6pm, I sat down and attempted to eat. No alteration of consciousness. A feeling of nausea had been building for the last hour. I had a few bites and found I could not eat due to feeling nausea. It did not feel too bad, I just felt full, altough I wasn\'t. I had had a portion of chips for lunch, and no food since then.    By seven o\'clock the nausea was reaching it\'s peak. I never had to go to the bathroom, but if I\'d have tried I could\'ve vomited. I do not like being sick, and avoid it if I can. I went and sat in the bedroom by myself. Start feeling an altered consciousness coming on. Pupils start to get big. At 7.50 I have a gravity bong. I do this with the intent of bringing on the effects, and subsiding the nausea. Within ten minutes both effects have been acheaved. I felt profoundly altered, but I couldn\'t decribe how. The only thing I have to compare it to is MDMA, to which it felt similar, but with no euphoria and no energy rush. I feel happy \'cos I already felt happy.    I listen to some music - Aereogramme, Scottish indie rock. It sounds fantastic. I notice a slight increase in the vividness of colours. I listen to Boards Of Canada (warp-electronica). Sounds incredible! The artwork looks amazing too. I speak to my girlfriend, and tell her I feel great. We kiss, and I am surprised and delighted that I get an amazing vision with my eyes closed. While kissing her, first I see a still image of us, in two tones of grey, as if it was embossed in stone. Then it starts moving for a few seconds, and I am watching me and my g/f kiss from a 3rd person perspective! The wierdness of it makes me open my eyes. Then, when she stroked my arm, I see vivid blue elecricity, a moving zigzag line, 6-8 inches long, travel down her arm into my body. I interpret this as love.    G/f leaves to watch TV in the other room. I lay on the bed and close my eyes, and I can see amazing CEV\'s. I wrote some notes at this point, and I described it as \'like Nintendo-MTV\'. I could see lots of little Yoshis dancing to the music! After five minutes of lying like this, I notice I can feel my breath on my chin. It feels like cold water is running across my chin when I breath out. I could still feel it when I started writing it down. My pupils are absolutely huge, approx 1mm of iris is visible.    After this the experience becomes more profound. This is the first time I have tripped like this. I close my eyes and listen to the music, and I see myself wake up in different places. The only way I can describe this is dreaming, but while being awake. Very different from daydreams. I can hear and see, but I can also feel things like the temperature etc. They only last for a few seconds at a time, and then I force myself to wake up, and I don\'t want to sleep or get stuck in an alternative dimension. I think I must be having a fear of ego-loss, so I let go of my fears, but I still can only remain in these places for very short times, long enough to only have a quick glimpse. The places I can remember best were on top of a mountain (very cold, white snow, beautiful blue sky) and being in some kind of tunnel. The tunnel is brown, with tentacles growing from the walls, and round doors lining it. It sounds a bit scary, but wasn\'t in the slightest.    Next, I open my eyes. Some slight visual distortions when I look at things, extremely vivid colours. When I look at the ceiling, I can see the posters on our wall in the periphery of my vision. We have the Kandinsky poster with 12 coloured circles that look like sweets. The colours start chnging very rapidly, and it looks like a light show - very inpressive! At the same time I can see the poster we have of a flower. The top of the flower grows toes and they start wiggling! This is very amusing! I see images from the past too, memories come back to me with ease. I also feel an intense love for my girlfriend.    I go into the lounge to speak to my g/f. By now it is nearly ten. The lounge is boring, TV is very disinteresting, even though it was a documentary about a subject I would normally enjoy. I warm up the food I couldn\'t eat earlier, but although I find it deliciious and am experiencing no nausea, I find it difficult to eat as I still feel full. Eat a spoonful of Ben & Jerry\'s icecream, which is very nice indeed, but that was all we had. I would\'ve liked more of that. I have a very sweet tooth!    I go to bed with g/f as I become extremely tired. However I find it dificult to sleep, and I have to go for a wee 3 times in the next two hours. When I go upstairs, in the bathroom I notice that if I stare at the walls they start distorting - slowly moving/ melting. This is funny! The next day I feel fine, a bit spaced when I first get up, but later on no different from how I usually feel, maybe just a bit tired. No trouble going about my day to day life.    My experience was great fun, I enjoyed the visual fun and games, and felt very happy. My experience felt at times very profound, and I think I learnt things about myself I had not fully realised before. I am glad I did it. I plan to repeat this experiment after a suitable time has passed, at least one month."
14311,An Amazing New Discovery in High-Def Vision,Omeron,"Aug 9, 2007",HB Woodrose & GHB,"Like other discoveries related to lysergides it seems, happened without planning. Originally an idea occurred to soak the seeds in water first to take off the husks easily, which worked fine. Then after cutting them into fourths with a \'utility\' (a.k.a. fuckin\' sharp) knife and letting them soak in the water some, the new discovery happened. The soaking allowed the actual shells of the seeds to sort of strip away, one could remove them easily by just squeezing them off, leaving the actual soft kernel. Rad! Then after throwing out the shells and allowing the soft kernel to soak produced a tea with distinctly less of that abdomen-churning pastey-floral smell. High hopes.    Unfortunately some miscommunication with another friend occurred so we didn\'t end up tripping at the same time and plans changed anyways, so the tea finally became ingested at 10:00 AM. The tea had thirteen seeds. Less LSA must have gone into the water also, maybe crushing the kernels would help. It came on very strangely. The first few hours had the good news of virtually no nausea at all and only a slight body load, maybe a tiny bit of stomach discomfort, but the effects didn\'t seem like much. Getting up things seemed a little weird.    Finally at 12:36 PM a decision had to get made, G often goes weirdly and unpredictably with LSA since LSA contains a relaxant, so one must take extreme care but hey not that much had happened yet, admittedly though it did have some typical heart-felt personal advice about a few matters, so already even if nothing much more would have happened it didn\'t seem like a loss, besides a big big trip didn\'t seem that desirable, so it as usual seemed just perfect, exactly needed at the time. Anyways at 12:36 just enough G became ingested to feel it and BOOOOOOOooOOoOoOoOoOm!    Don\'t ask why but that picked it up a notch. Sometimes G seems to dull the effects of LSA, to the point where they return when the G wears off, but sometimes the exact opposite happens and this time it happened. Not the soaring swooping mental vortices of a full thirteen-seed trip but certainly a big improvement. Just lying around, enjoying the ambient music, listening to some Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy, the radio drama, and turning on Star Trek TNG at 2:00. The G also added a little hilarity which felt quite welcome. The Creator always provides what you need in any given situation and this varies from time to time to place to a space re-placed. After a while around 4:00 or so it sort of had the feel wishing to return to a bit more \'normal\' of a state and fortunately an hour\'s sleep helped, then some food and vitamins and things rounded things off.    When standing up to do things, things did feel a little more fevered as far as vision and not wanting to remain standing for long, but the absence of nausea made it tolerable, just get up to do what needs doing then lie back down in comfort. The stomach feels a little off though that could happen from only getting one meal today thus far. Not sure what Else to say, no big cosmic revelations [yet] though things do seem more open, processing some spiritual projects and projecting some spiritual processes sort of left on the back burner for a while.    LSA doesn\'t seem like a thing to do a lot but one might argue the plant has that in its design. Every flower has its hour. Oh one interesting thing though, during and even now to a degree a knowing exists maybe half a second ahead of \'now\', at first it seemed like telepathy or knowing what someone would say but it happened when watching Star Trek, and when talking to a friend later, like doing pattern matching on the words and filling in what they would say or something, cool. The sub-conscious has re-opened to a pattern UV in-fourmation. Omeron - Effortless Union with the Divine. Think globally, act nonlocally."
28670,Something but Not Enough,Hatchling,"Jul 28, 2007",H.B Woodrose,"First off I will start by stating that I have had no previous experiences with psychadelics of any kind (unless u consider ecstacy one but thats up to you) and therefor I did not know what to expect, if anything. I say this because I would never expect these little seeds to actually work. My reasons for actually wanting to trip were sort of spiritual and just out of sheer curiosity.     [Setting] In my room by myself. My bed was all prepared to wrap myself in for a comfortable situation. The television was turned on and I spent most of my night chatting online with friends.      [10:00p.m.] I have 6 seeds all shaved of their outer coating ready for consumption. I was debating on how to consume them but then just decided to grind them with a mortar into a fine powdery substance. I then dropped the powder into a small glass of water and let it sit for about 1 hour.     [11:00] I wasnt sure what would be the most effective means for a water extraction but by this time I had grown impatient and decided to just drink the concotion and the remaining residue.     [11:20] I started to feel off baseline, it was nothing significantly different from the consumption of 1 glass of beer, but definitely not feeling normal. I proceeded to chat with a friend online who was very experienced with psychadelics. Although he was not familiar with H.B Woodrose in which case he could not provide much information on the possible effects he did tell me that once I started to trip I would know it.     [11:45] I started to loose my attention span a bit. I noticed I was drifting my attention from chatting to just focussing on one particular place on the computer screen. If I stared at something it would very subtly start to warp. I was skeptical on whether or not I was actually doing that on my own (subconciously knowing I had swallowed the seeds) or the seeds were actually working.    [12:00a.m.] It was around this time that I started to elevate in my sensations. I took a small break from the computer and sat on my bed to watch television. I spent most of the time watching late night talk shows, mostly leno then conan. I realised that I was becoming very intrigued by what was being shown. Although I knew then that had I been sober it would not have been so appealing I knew that I was somewhat intoxicated. It is a very hard feeling to describe. For the next forty five minutes or so I got mild waves of euphoria (although nothing anywhere near the realm of ecstacy which I had tried once.    [12:50-1:45] Through this time period nothing really got any more intense then just my elevated amusement with the television shows and the occasional mild euphoric waves. I eventually got pretty tired and convinced that the experience was not going to advance past this stage.     [2:00] I grew too tired to even attempt to stay up and wait out a possible change in my state so I decided to turn the lights off and try to sleep. This is where it ended.     All in all I dont know what to really make out of the entire experience. I know I definitely felt different but nothing near my expectations. I dont know if these seeds were just weak or maybe I needed a higher dosage of them. The mild experience I did have was very very pleasant and for that I am grateful. I still have plenty of seeds left and will attempt them on a higher dosage some time in the near future. I know they at least work somewhat because of my weak change in perception but I am not in any way going to declare that they can not produce a mind blowing experience because I didnt reach that point or at least really attempt to. I have a feeling that with the right dosage I will reach the point I am after but as for this experience it was very rewarding and defintely something to try if you are curious.     P.S. I did not in any way experience any nausea and I believe that prior to consuming the seeds I had eaten about 4 hours earlier. Good luck and be safe :)"
11553,The Other Side,MTBtripper,"Jul 27, 2007",H. B. Woodrose & Nitrous Oxide,"[Erowid Note: 48 inhalations of nitrous oxide is considered an extremely high dose]    I got home from lifting weights and decided today would be a good day to take some HBWS.  It was a rainy Sunday afternoon and it and I had nothing to do.  On the way home I stopped by the local headshop to pick up some more nitrous, those guys must think I\'m a nitrous freak by now.  I\'ve often used nitrous/marijuana as a combo of choice to explore my mind/existence, I\'ve had some good results as long as I didn\'t try to do it too much!  On the previous Wednesday I for the first time smoked some Salvia with the nitrous, and it was the most intense thing I\'ve ever felt!  I was listening to some Medeski Martin and Wood, and I\'ve never felt music like that before!    So about 5 hours after taking the seeds, I was feeling them but it wasn\'t very intense.  I just downloaded some live Bob Marley so I lit up some candles, turned on my heat dish (highly recommended for nitrous trippers!)and cracked a few charges into my balloon.  After I inhaled the nitrous I completely lost myself in time/space.  The last thing I remember was my exgirlfriend\'s mom from 10 years ago say \'now you\'re going to meet your makers.\'  This made me laugh, and I had thoughts of strange chemist/gods who create us for their own amusement.    As a mountain bike addict, I had visions of my makers as stoner mountain bikers, and this was the funniest thing in the world at the time.  Along with this nitrous flash came a wave of INTENSE pleasure.  When I became aware of who/where I was I starting cracking more nitrous and continued until they were gone.  Well, the term \'chasing the dragon\' comes to mind, I wanted to return to the place I was just at, not only for the mind expansion but for the INTENSE pleasure.    Soon the experience went from good to bad.  I felt like a complete junkie, sucking away at this balloon all alone in my room.  I then went on one of those introspective life trips:  What am I doing with my life?  Are these drugs I take for spiritual purposes and not just an excuse to get high?  Suddenly, my feelings of oneness with the universe reversed, and I felt complete isolation.  I still had like 30 nitrous hits left, and for some reason I could not stop doing them, even though the trip was getting very negative.  I examined things like my inability to commit to a woman, my rebellious nature, everything.  Suddenly my whole existence was a sham, society wasn\'t wrong like I have always thought but it\'s my inability to follow the leader that\'s the problem.  And yet I continued to crack these goddamn nitrous hits into the balloon of death, or so it suddenly seemed.    Finally I finished the nitrous, I think I may have been crying as my makers pounded me with the reality I have been hiding from all these years.  The concept of having a family, which has always seemed to be an unneccesary burden to me, suddenly seemed to be what I was so lacking to make my life complete.  I felt as though I may die soon, and I better reproduce before it happens.  All of this was swimming through my head when I made my way to the toilet to puke.  As I was puking, I felt as though I may have been dying, and that death would be the only way end this bad trip.    Then I heard my 3 year old niece say \'Don\'t go Uncle Jim, I need you!\'  This made me think of all my loved ones, and how much I mean to them.  How much people look to me for strength, which I have a lot of.  The only problem now was that I felt brain damaged.  Usually, when I stop breathing the nitrous it goes away, but with the seeds in me it seemed to just continue.  I felt like I knew what it was like to be other people, and I understood things from other people\'s perspectives (another of my serious flaws), and I understood how the world doesn\'t operate by my rules of logic that I so rely on and preach about to everyone.      The only way to end this was to go to sleep.  I got into bed and closed my eyes, but things were still twisted.  Everything looked small and far off.  I was hearing strange voices and I thought \'This is what it must be like to be schizophrenic.\'  Unfortunately, I couldn\'t sleep.  I could just lay there and examine my shortcomings:  my constant joking around was suddenly not my goodnatured personality but my lack of maturity, my rebellious nature and admiration of people like Che Guevara was suddenly not due to my ability to see the world as it truly is but my inability to mesh with other people.  I have never felt more alone or isolated in my entire life.    The first 5 hits of nitrous were like seeing heaven, but I think I had to pay the price and see Hell as well.  I think it\'ll be awhile before I journey off into the void again.  EVERYTHING has it\'s dark side, and if you are intent on seeing the world as it truly is, beware that the dark side is in us all.  Now I understand the judeo-christian tradition of seperating good from evil, it\'s alot easier to believe that the evil is in other things, but not oneself.  I think I did learn something though, and it\'s that I\'m not getting any younger (27) and that part of life is making new life, which scares the shit outta me but I think it\'s time for me to move on to a new phase and stop tripping so much: it\'s time for action."
47299,Vomit and Deep Thought,RaSman,"Jul 10, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Date: 10/22/05  Preparation: ~3 weeks prior; 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds (5 for me, 5 for a friend) are scraped of most furry coating, sanded, rinsed with water with a lil bit of dish detergent, and rinsed with distilled water. The seeds were placed in airtight container with enough distilled water to cover them, and a drop or two of vodka was added to keep them from germinating (Ive had them germinate overnite without the alcohol).  Initial Setting: My friend\'s basement  Timelime:  T +0:00 (around 2:00PM): My friend and I shake up the seeds and liquid and evenly split both up between us. Half the liquid, half the seeds. The liquid has like no taste, but the seeds are still crunchy and bitter-tasting. Perhaps the alcohol preserved the seeds\' hardness.  T +0:45: Effects are setting in slowly. Heavy, relaxed feeling with some nausea, but mostly mental, I thought.  T +1:00: Minor visual trails, some CEVs, deep thought, some minor color distortion. Things periodically looked purple and/or green for a second.  T +2:30: Trails, CEVs, etc. have ceased, but body nows feels light and wired. I decide to leave my friends house and go home. I figured the seeds had spoiled from being stored.   [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    T +2:40: Stop @ 7/11 and my body feels extremely light and bouncy. Driving is not impared at all. No problems with concentration or reactions.  T +2:50: Arrive at home; shortly thereafter I get first feeling of sickness and vommit the pizza from my friend\'s house I knew I should have not eaten (DAMMIT).  T +3:30 to T +7:30 (6:30PM to 9:30PM): Vommited about 2-3 times early-on and kept trying to fall asleep. Then I felt wonderful. Drunk and high and numb. Some OEV in the dark. Deep, deep thought. Kept having to urinate every 5 minutes.  T +7:30: Around when I finally fell asleep.  T +8:00: I woke up feeling the sickest I\'d felt, but not intoxicated. I rushed to the bathroom. A small amount of projectile vomit. My parents arrive home, thankfully. I came close to blacking out. Drank some gatorade and ate some crackers. Felt somewhat better. I went back to sleep.  T +13:00 (3:00AM): Woke up feeling 100% better.  T Next Morning: No hangover or other side-effects.  Notes: My friend kept having people call because he felt like a million bucks and wanted more. He had no negative effects. We had the same dose and were both first timers, so I really don\'t understand this, but I suppose everyone is different. This friend is also more experienced and a heavy user of other drugs, compared to me who does things like twice and moves on. Overall the experience could have been better, but I\'m sure it could have been worse. Perhaps the seeds were sitting for too long or the lil bit of coating left made me sick."
39173,Rebirth,Shouhei,"Jul 10, 2007","Syrian Rue, Mushrooms - P. Cubensis, H.B. Woodrose Seeds & Cannabis","[Erowid Note:  Combining MAOIs with other psychoactive drugs carries serious medical risks and can result in extremely unpleasant side effects, overheating, nausea, confusion, heart problems, and even death. Please see <a href=\'/chemicals/maois/maois.shtml\'>Erowid\'s MAOI Vault]    I took 2 capsules of syrian rue around 11:45, at 12:00 I ate 25g of Mushrooms, and also drank a solution containing 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds that I had made the night before. I noticed stomach irritation as I was drinking the solution, and retched when I got to the bottom, where all the bits of seeds had sunk.    For around an hour after this everything was fine, a normal trip, great OEVs, no noticable CEVs. By around 12:45 I decided to have a little smoke of some cannabis, to soothe my stomach, as I was feeling very groggy by then. The cannabis helped slightly, but at approximately 13:00 I vomited violently, which put me into major shock. The trip was coming on very very strong, and the shock of being sick made me want to go to sleep. This was very traumatic, I thought I was going to die, my breath was short, and I was shaking.    I proceeded to go to the bathroom at the other end of the house, with the intention of having a shower. Once I got there I couldn\'t walk properly, and managed to sit on the side of the bath, before I half-collapsed on the floor, unable to stand. This is where I stayed for the most part of the trip. I was sure I had died, by around 13:45 my trip sitter was very worried, and offered to call an ambulance, but I told him not to knowing that this would cause unnecessary stress on me, and my other friend who was also tripping on just mushrooms.     My trip sitter had to leave at 14:00, so I was alone in the bathroom. I have never experienced a trip of this magnitude, for the most part I had my eyes shut, in a sort of half sleep state. I felt like I was in another world, I was experiencing major auditory hallucinations, as well as OEVs and CEVs. I was convinced that I was going to be born again, as I had died. I felt like I was back in the womb, I could imagine anywhere and feel as if I was there.    The trip got stronger as I peaked, it must have been around 15:00 - 16:00 and I was still stuck in this catatonic state, singing and laughing to myself on the bathroom floor. By this time I think the shock had worn off, but I didn\'t try and get up. I felt like there was a warm blanket around me, protecting me. I can\'t explain in detail what was going through my mind at the time, as I can\'t fully remember. When I stretched I felt like I was a million miles long, I could perceive anything I wanted to by this stage.     By around 17:00 I had started to come down, my parents returned. I started to reawaken and by about 18:00 I emerged from my sanctuary. I still felt as if I had died, and I thought I may have gone to heaven, or been given a second chance. I couldn\'t understand what had happened. I was still seeing things in the wrong colours at around 19:00 and I think the effects only really wore off around 21:00.     This trip was possibly the most emotional experience of my life, I can\'t explain how mind blowing it was. I urge anyone who tries this combination to have a good trip sitter around, and to be prepared to vomit. I really wasn\'t expecting the vomit, and I think that is what sent this trip on a downward spiral. I would consider myself an experienced tripper, and I\'ve experienced all these substances before, but this trip was much much much more intense than anything I have ever experienced before."
36281,Intensity Far Beyond Morning Glories,Yogi Wannabe,"Jun 10, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"First off, let\'s get into my mindset here. I don\'t take any medication or herbs regularly, just vitamin pills, and occasional caffeine and alcohol. Although I have experimented with marijuana, mushrooms, morning glory seeds, and DXM. I have suffered from depression and anxiety disorder in the past and am fascinated by psychedelics and their help in therapy in experiments conducted by psychologists in the 60s. Also I had recently read about how some Ancient cultures wouldn\'t consider someone an adult until they had had a full blown psychedelic experience. I have experimented with Morning Glory seeds before and decided that HBW seeds give more bang for the buck.    So I purchased Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and rinsed them off. I then peeled off the shells and fuzzy brown coating mostly with my finger nails because I kept cutting myself with the knife when I tried to use. I then ground them in a coffee grinder and poured the powder into 16oz. of grapefruit juice. It was hard as hell to keep the drink down, possibly due to previous experiences with morning glory seeds, which have given me pretty bad nausea in the past, although it didn\'t really taste too bad. In retrospect, I got most but not all of the fuzzy coating off.     The first effects were slight fatigue and nausea which gradually increased. About two hours after dosing the fatigue grew so intense that all I wanted to do was lay on the bed. My joints ached and I felt very nauseous and had the decision to make of whether to lay by the toilet or on my bed. I slumped by the toilet and had so little energy that I had to hold my head up with my hands. As much as I wanted the stuff out of me at this point, I didn\'t have the energy to vomit so I knew that I had to deal with these effects. Thoughts swam around my head that I had poisoned myself with these seeds and I had to keep reassuring myself that I would be all right due to the reasonable dose. I collapsed on my bed and listened to some music but it didn\'t sound as good as it has on other drugs although it was enhanced. It had more of a 3-D effect and I could feel the emotions a little more than usual. The pain in my joints, nausea, and the fatigue were so bad it took all my strength just to stand up. I decided once and for all it wasn\'t worth the hell I was going through for any positive effects.    After seven hours had passed, I had to pretend I was taking a nap so my mom couldn\'t tell I was tripping. I laid down in bed and I started panicking and wondering if I would ever come down. What if I had to go to work the next day with my pupils dilated? In some of my more relaxed moments, I started thinking about everyone I know and that I had lost touch with and what they were doing right at that second. I thought about how much I miss my grandmother. I eventually had to pee so I decided I\'d have to pretend to wake up. I peed and watched some t.v. Luckily my mom couldn\'t tell I was tripping. Thankfully she did not look into my eyes much at all, which was a good thing because the visual stage had just begun! A full 8 HOURS after ingesting the seeds!!! I don\'t know if grapefruit juice or the strange dosage curve has anything to do with the length of time it took. The visuals were pretty much nonmoving patterns that resemble ancient art designs. The body load started to lighten up by this time as I physically felt more agile and that I could keep food down. Although I was worried that the real trip seemed to be just beginning, I felt comfortable that I wasn\'t hiding in my room and was prepared for any consequences that may result.    Anyway, maybe the decision to stop pretending I was asleep opened up my mind. I suddenly felt this intense love towards my mom and all of humanity. I thought about how we all just want to be loved deep down and we are all in search of it. I wanted to tell her that moment that I loved her but she would have known something was going on with me. We only say that when going away for a while so it was best if I kept my mouth shut or she\'d know I was on something. If she had known I was tripping there would have been hell to pay.    It seems that it took down some walls that had been built up. I\'m a big dude but it was o.k. to miss my grandmother. I thought of stuff I never would have thought about. How we should all be real and stop faking so much. So much of what people do is to build up some facade so that other people will think a certain way about them. It seemed that I was sleepwalking through life and I have to wake up and get active.    To sum up, I received some amazing insights from eight little seeds. But I would not wish the eight hours of hell that I went through on anyone. Please be careful, those eight seeds are tiny but knocked a 230 pound guy on his ass for a good eight hours. I personally won\'t ever try them again in spite of the revelations. The effects lasted THIRTEEN HOURS IN ALL!!!!!"
62429,Red Face,Kingkong,"Jun 2, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"Recently, I ordered some seeds from the net, and never being allergic to anything else, had no fear of an allergic reaction. I\'m 26, tripped a couple times on shrooms, once on lsd, all were enjoyable. Mindset and setting were good, alone in barracks room (I\'m military, therefore the \'legal\' highs). Scraped off coating w/ fingernail file (found this a good method) and crushed up 10 seeds, soaked in 10 oz. bottled water before ingesting. Had eaten about 5 hours earlier.    30 min. later, got nauseous and puked exorcist style into the bathroom sink. not too bad, mostly water, not much burn. About 30-45 min. after puking, wasn\'t feeling much, decided to use the sublingual method reported on this site for 6 seeds, crushed up, put in 1 oz. bottled water for about 5 min., held in mouth for about 20 min, spit out. 20-30 min. later, no effects, except for face turning red,(warmth in face). I Repeated the same dose/method done again, only the coating was not scraped off as well in the interest of time.    About 10-20 min. later, I started noticing extreme redness in the face/neck, and very many red spots all over arms and back and chest. Had never had an allergic reaction to any substance before, but I knew this was what it must be. Would\'ve went to the hospital, but, as I said, I\'m military, so going to the hospital and saying \'I just took 22 H.B. Woodrose seeds so I could trip\' would be a bad idea. Felt a little mind trip, like a little lsd, but not a whole lot. Thought I might die. Not the \'oh no! I\'m tripping!\' gonna die, but the \'oh no\' - \'my throat and sinuses are closing so I can\'t breathe\' kind of die.    Was getting cold, so I lay down on the bed and covered up. Started shaking violently, and the little mind trip didn\'t help, but I\'m a pretty calm person, so I talked myself down, stopped shaking, and went to sleep/waking dream state for a couple hours. Woke up, threw up again, as on the second subligual trial, I had ingested about half the solution (about 3 seeds worth) felt much better, still some redness, but no convulsions, no throat closing, etc. Slept for about 10 hrs, woke up the next day and felt normal. Think I may try the 2-step extraction using ethanol and naptha lighter fluid next time, as I seem to be allergic to these seeds. If you are thinking this is a good way to trip, apparently it works for some, but I would suggest taking a very small dose (2-3 seeds), then waiting for a couple of hours to see if you are allergic first.    Happy tripping!"
45975,The Flu,FoxieRedd,"Jun 2, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"In my ongoing search for the perfect legal psychoactive substance I decided to try HBW. I have had mostly good experiences with similar trips in the past so was hoping for an interesting night. Being a bit of a hardhead I took 10 seeds and broke them up in a mortar and pestle, removing some of the outer skin but finding most to be impossible to separate from the flesh. I packed the powder into 2 200mg capsules and swallowed them with orange juice. I had deliberately eaten lightly that day and had avoided food for 4 hours prior to injestion. My partner decided he wanted a pizza so we jumped in the car and popped down to the local takeout. On return as I was getting out of the car I had my usual alert, my nose started to run but instead of fading out as usual my sinuses completely closed off and I was only able to breathe through my mouth. My partner ate most of the pizza but by then I was getting hungry so I had one small slice. This was about 30 minutes after the capsules.     At T+60 minutes I was aware of changes in perception and a decidedly uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. I felt extremely stoned and noticed my eyes flickering. Pupils were dilated and muscle wringing was happening. This continued at a similar level for 3 hours with a gradual ramp up to slight visual disturbance, the carpet was shimmering, and my thoughts were getting increasingly focused on my stomach and the other body discomfort. Getting a bit bored I gave up on the night and decided to go to bed.    Sleep was impossible! The muscle wringing caused constant movement and I was peeing every 45 minutes, I was very dehydrated and had frequent sips of water. Eventually I gave up and at T+8 hours, 3 in the morning, my best friend who was staying with us, decided to sit with me and watch some TV. We never made the living room. I stopped at the bathroom on the way and promptly purged violently from both ends. Its a good thing my friend is very close and has a sense of humour and that the sink is so close to the bowl. Of course the pizza was completely undigested, Lovely!    The purging obviously released some of the trapped crushed seeds because my eyes rapidly dilated almost fully and the visual effects increased, unfortunately so did the body load so we made our careful way to the TV room with a bowl just in case.    At T+11 hours with no loss of level I finally fell asleep on the couch only to be awakened 2 hours later by the postman. I was still wildly tripping but at a slightly reduced level. I must have been a scary sight as I answered the door. By T+18 hours I was back to baseline but totally trashed. Its now T+26 hours and I feel like I have had a dose of flu. The blocked sinuses were clear by the time I was back at baseline.    Never again! These seeds are going into the garden. The insight was negligable and the visuals unimpressive for the level of body load, I\'ll stick to good old Salvia from now on."
26354,The Double Trip,Sir. Fallen Angel,"May 26, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"This report is typed by me about 3 days after the event, and I can tell you its an event I will never forget.    We were supposed to take LSD on a thursday night in a Squatted place in \'Diemen\', a little town close to Amsterdam in Holland. We were trying to get LSD but there was no one that could supply us with the \'king of drugs\'. I arrived there on thursday at about 16:00 and since we did not get LSD we decided to get some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, since I had some good previous experience with them and the others wanted to try them too.     So we whent to a smartshop and got the seeds, whent back home, smoked some joints and took the seeds at about 20:00. There were 3 people taking the seeds, me and two female friends of mine. On of them took tripdrugs lots of times before but never saw anything weird, and when she did not see anything about an hour after taking the seeds she started complaining about the fact that she never saw anything when taking tripdrugs. She also started to get into a light \'bad\' trip, it was clear by her voice. Later on she left. From that moment on I did not feel too good, being afraid she would end up in a bad trip. The other girl was fine, enjoying perfect visual effect. We were lying on a balcony looking at the stars by the way.     From that moment onwards (it must have been something like 22:15) things started going bad for me. Visualizations stopped and fear started to kick in. Fear of the well known \'bad trip\'. I was feeling that fear because I did not feel 100% ok after the complaining of the girl and the idea she was going to have a bad trip. Because of the fear of a bad trip my hartbeat started to increase, I was panicking. At this point all visual effects stopped completely. I was freaking out and my hartbeat was reaching high levels. In the room next to the balcony there were about 12 people playing guitar and having fun. I had them sent away since they were also pulling me more and more towards a bad experience. They all left except for the girl that was enjoying the trip. This for the first time ever was a bad thing, because of the fact she was enjoying it I started to get kind of jelous of her, and started feeling more bad, wishing that I could also have fun. Then, whilst my hartbeat was (in my perception) extremely high (I have this little \'hartproblem\' so all hartbeat increases in my perception were a total threat of me being killed) and I was really thinking I would die at that very moment. Then the most intense fear ever started taking over, however I did not want to tal about it since I did not want the girl next to me to end up in a bad trip as well. I was just lying there, shivering, shaking, totally scared, wishing it would end..    During that period I took a look at my mobile phone and I saw that it was only 23:00 and experience tought me that a trip would last up to 10 hours. That would mean I still had 7 horribly bad hours to go. I was starting to get afraid of the fact that I might get caught in this bad trip forever since, as we all know, mental hospitals are full of that sorts of people, all these thoughts were crossing my mind and making me more and more afraid. At this point I had reached the feeling of total terror. I was more afraid as I had ever been or ever will be. I was completely utterly terified. In a clear moment then I realized I needed someone I could trust, someone who was capable of pulling me out of this hell. I grabbed my mobile phone and called \'maartje\', the person with who I had my first LSA trip and since it was the best trip ever I thought hearing her voice would make me remember the good times and pull me out of it. Luckily she answered but she was not really in an opertunity to talk. We talked for a little while (15 minutes or so) and I calmed down a bit. We hung up and I tried to enjoy my trip again. After 10 minutes again I was pulled down, this time because of the fact I was totally alone and I realized there was no-one that could help me here.     Now total panick came since I could not find my phone, which at that moment was the only link to people I completely trusted. I knew there was a phone in the house but I could not remember any phonenumbers. Eventually I found my phone and called \'Achiel\', a friend of mine who I totally trust and who at that moment was the only one who could get me out of it. Luckily he also answered the phone and was alone, in the middle of a boring movie, so he had all the time in the world. We talked on the phone for about 3 or 4 hours, and slowly, really slowly I was getting back to myself and losing my had trip. We hung up a couple of times in between since some people that also did drugs required some attention and rest, this since they were also feeling the beginning of a bad trip. In the end when we hung up for the last time I was finally in a good mood again, able to be alone without sliding away. From that moment onwards the trip again became what it should have been. Everything was breathing and vibrating, looking 1000x more alive and beatiful as ever before. The euphoric feeling that I had the two previous times with LSA returned and I lay alone in the living room enjoying my further trip for the next 3 hours or so. Then the stuff started to stop working and I whent into a peacefull beautiful sleep.     In the end my conclusion is that I should have had more respect for the drug. Since I had done LSA a couple of times before I thought I could just take it anywhere, anytime. This very very clearly was not the case. For that same reason I decided to never take drugs again without having someone there who I can trust, or who I love, and I am going to take them in an envoirement that I choose. The feeling during a bad trip can only be described as primal fear, there is no way to describe this if you have\'nt been there once. This story is told by me to inform and warn other people, since I don\'t even wish my worst enemy this kind of experience.     Overall it has been a good epxerience, it has tought me a lot and I still had 3 or 4 hours of good trippin, in the end I never would have wanted to miss this, it has been very educating."
24552,\x91No Puke\x92 Fuel & Water Extraction,Lurid Burn,"May 22, 2007",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Want to dose Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds without puking?  Read on.    Personally, I have read or skimmed every single HBW seed report.  Holy cow, folks, we are creating a legacy of barf.  One after the other, puke-a-rama.  And yet, there is information available regarding the extraction of LSA.  Why arent more of us doing it?  Well, below I describe a cheap and very effective extraction method.  Next time you ponder these seeds, do yourself a favor and consider this preparation.    Briefly, about me: Ive done over 250 LSD trips, about 20 MDMA trips, 7 DXM excursions, and a couple significant Salvia experiences.  Cannabis and alcohol has flowed throughout it all.  Now, drug experiences are rare, but still enjoyable.    Before my successful LSA extraction, I did have one prior HBW seed experience.  One week earlier, I ingested 8 (crushed, dark brown coatings removed) seeds in blended water and ginger.  I tripped on what felt like 1 1/2 hits of LSD and felt quite drunk.  But, 3 hours after I dosed, the incessant stomach cramps overtook me and I puked big time.  Felt like poison was crawling through my veins.  At dose plus 5 hours, merely walking down my hallway, I lost consciousness, collapsed, and then puked again.  That being said, I still had some fun with the seeds.    So now I am determined to make an effort and separate the bad from the good.  Exactly one week after my first HBW trip, I dosed again, with proper prep.  And, despite a slightly sloppy execution, the method worked flawlessly.  (\x95\x95\x95However, my trip ended up a little on the light end.  Perhaps it was tolerance from the week before, maybe it was I didnt totally crush up my seeds, or maybe 8 seeds, when using this method is a diminished dose.\x95\x95\x95)    PREPARATION:    \x95 8 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds  \x95 Coleman Fuel (AKA white gas) (available at camping supply and hardware stores)  \x95 8 oz. Distilled water (available at grocery stores)  \x95 Two jars with lids  \x95 Two coffee filters  \x95 Cookie sheet or comparable flat surface    This will take about 3 hours preparation and an additional 28 hours of non-involvement waiting.  (You must invest this time.  No shortcuts.)    Scrape off all dark brown coating on HBW seeds.  Perhaps if an extraction really does only extract the LSA, this step is irrelevant, but, for me, with the stomach churning memories of a non-extraction trip fresh in my mind, I scraped anyway.  I used a strong Xacto knife.  It took about an hour.  Eventually I had 8 seeds that now were of a very light coffee color.    Crush / smash seeds.  Ideally you want all seed matter to be reduced to powder form.  Use a coffee grinder, or a mortar and pestle.  I just crushed them with pliers, then dropped them in a Ziploc bag and hammered them.  This left me with a portion of powder, a majority of granules, and a few stray larger chunks.    Add seed matter to jar.  Pour in fuel, enough to cover seed matter, plus some.  Ive read you cant add too much, but you can do too little, so go ahead and use the fuel.  Leave enough room in the jar to shake it later.  I used Colemans fuel, which comes in a 1 gallon can and is readily available in camping & hardware stores.    Seal jar and shake it up.    Let this sit for 60 minutes, shaking occasionally.  Sometimes a seed chunk would hug the jar above the fuel line.  I made sure to swish the liquid around so that all seed matter was in the fuel bath before walking away from it.    With a coffee filter over another jar, pour the seed mush and fuel through it.  Takes a little time.  Eventually you will have fuel in the 2nd jar and seed pulp in the coffee filter.  Apparently you can re-use this fuel, but having bought a gallon, I opted to set the opened jar outside and let it evaporate.    Spread the seed mush out on a cookie sheet.  Smell it.  Smells bad?  It should.  But take note of that fuel smell as you will want to let the seed mush sit here for a few hours until YOU DO NOT SMELL THE FUEL ANYMORE!  Also, keep it out of the sun, and open a window.  Just let it sit and evaporate.  For me, it took about 3 hours until I could no longer smell the gas.  What was left was a familiar nutty scent attributed to the HBW seed.    Add dried, fuel-scent free seed matter to a clean jar.  Pour in 8 ozs. of DISTILLED water.  Ive read that tap water, containing chemicals, isnt good enough.  And that 190 proof Vodka is the best.  But the extractions using alcohol call for 3 days waiting which I did not have.  I bought a jug of distilled water at the grocery store instead.  Whatever amount of water you add at this point you will end up drinking the next day for the dose.  I chose 8 ozs., but I suppose less would be just as good.    Seal lid.  Shake it up.  Let sit for 24 hours.  The liquid will go from light yellow, to gold, then light brown, and finally, one day later, dark dark brown.  I shook it up occasionally.    Now, with a coffee filter over a water glass, carefully pour water & seed mush through filter.  This is a much slower process than the first filtration, so be patient.  It took about an hour.  And I ended up accidentally spilling some over the side.  When all water and seed mush is strained, discard the filter and mush.    In your water glass you now have 8 ozs. of water containing the LSA of 8 HBW seeds.  Congratulations.  I drank mine slowly, over the course of 30 minutes.  I held each gulp in my mouth for a few minutes, seeing if I could get the LSA going sublingually quicker than the normal slow LSA onset.  I also took large gulps of clean water in between.  I felt light effects 20 minutes after starting the drink.  Within 2 hours I started my peak.    I had dinner at 8pm.  And confidently dosed at 10pm.  I had a 4 hour peak LSA trip that can be described as somewhat psychedelic and very drunk.  Some visual distortions, and some fun emotional journeys.  I had absolutely no problems in my stomach.  I probably could have even eaten if I had felt like it.  Although, since I spilled some water at the end of the extraction (I ended up with 6 ozs. in the glass) and I didnt entirely smash up my seeds, Id speculate I did not get as much LSA from 8 seeds as possible.    You could always use a larger amount of seeds and then check yourself as you gradually dose.  Also, there is a lot of talk of Everclear or 190 proof Vodka, or even 80 proof alcohol instead of the distilled water.  Ive read that water, no matter what kind, will not totally eliminate the nausea-causing elements of these seeds.  But this was not my experience.    At any rate, be careful.  I hope this helps.  Enjoy.    _Lurid Burn"

Although it\'s always pleasant to have a good laugh, these substances are natures tools to help awaken us and should not be abused or taken lightly.     I have found an excellent psychotropic mix that works wonders for meditation, self enjoyment, and connecting with nature and the cosmos. Through trial and error I found that the following works best to aid in my rituals... Chew 9 to 18 Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds for 5-10 minutes, sucking on the juices. Spit out or swallow the seeds. (may feel mild nausea, motion sickness pills will help) Then swallow 3 to 6 grams of chewed chopped or powdered Acorus Calamus.     The full effects could take up to three hours before noticed. So be careful and be patient. This combo mix\'s effects should be easily equally intense to a good shroom trip or can be compared to a hit of good paper.(LSD) Calamus by itself can create a speedy but relaxing MDMA like feeling and can be hallucenogenic in larger doses. It often creates feelings of hapiness and great energy. HBWR seeds create hallucenogenic effects similar to LSD, but not as potent and have a tendancy to be more of a downer by themselves. Mixing these two together is not dangerous. They will greatly intensify the effects of each other. The experience is mind opening colorful and psychadelic to say the least. My experience with it has been nothing but positive. The trip has an energy of its own and can last up to 12 hours. The experience really shouldn,t be compared to alot of recreational drug use or other Psychoactive use. A nice long walk through the woods is recommended. So this is what I call my spirit mix.  Good luck to all thats interested and have a good trip...See you on the other side...."
37435,Lost on the Beach,johnphenyl,"Feb 18, 2007",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose,"A friend (M) and I had the chance to take several days off from college and travel. While preparing to hike one of the most remote and beautiful sections of ocean coast in the 48 U.S. states (part of a national park), we decided to take some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds to enhance what should already be a very special experience. I am fairly inexperienced with  psychoactives, having tried 2C-E, 2C-I, morning glory, salvia, DXM, and nitrous in the past but only one or two trials of each substance. M has tried all these drugs in addition to LSD and mushrooms. Also, we had each tried very low doses of HBWR (2 seeds) which in the past had produced positive threshold effects. My strongest psychedelic experience so far would have to be the 20mg dose of 2C-E, which was a very strong trip. This trip consisted far less of lounging around listening to music than our typical excursions and far more physical activity.    Anyway, around 1:00pm I ingest five HBWR seeds (Hawaiian strain) simply by chewing and swallowing. M eats six, though he holds the seed grit in his mouth for 30 minutes or so before swallowing. I\'d had almost nothing to eat that day. Neither of us experienced any real nausea, cramps, or other body effects--surprising considering HBWR\'s reputation and the unpleasant nausea we\'d both experienced with morning glory. We didn\'t shave the seeds of bark or fuzzy coating. About half an hour after taking the seeds, we begin a nine-mile loop hike through dense forest and pristine wilderness beach. I didn\'t bring anything to measure time with, and there\'s really no point in guessing after this point because the time dilation was so strong. Effects slowly build up. M comments that the trail description didn\'t mention that the hike becomes more magical as you go along. The trail is wooden boardwalk for three miles leading through temperate rainforest and seems absolutely surreal, as if out of a storybook. Green overwhelms my vision and seems especially lush and vibrant.    As we approach the ocean, anticipation builds up and finally reaching the beach after the three miles was quite euphoric. It was truly one of the most pictureque scenes you could find in the United States, on psychedelics or not. This first part of the trail ends at a clearing with a view of the coast--ocean meeting steep forested hillsides--plus jutting rocks and gorgeous tiny islands in the distance. Some young deer roam freely around the area and seem entirely unfazed by our presence. There is a sense of connection with the simplicity and beauty of these creature\'s lives in the forest by the beach.    We continue hiking along the beach and come to a small hill jutting out from the mainland. We christen this place the \'Top of the World\'. I was thinking about how this was the most beautiful place I had ever seen and wanted to take a picture, but whenever I tried to it seemed like I was missing an essential part of the scene. I told M, \'How can I capture all of reality in one shot?\' I was near the peak around this time, though the time curve for HWBR means that peak effects lasted for quite a while longer. Mental effects were most prominent, though there were some visuals in the form of all the scenery generally moving around slightly and some patterning. There was little time to lie down and introspect or gaze at CEVs. Colors were definitely enhanced, too. My balance was somewhat messed up, but it felt good.    We continued hiking along the beach, and then the trip temporarily took a turn for the worse.. far worse. I started to get worried about the tide coming in and trapping us against the steep hills and cliffs. This was a real danger, but not for hours later and in reality the coming darkness was more worthy of my fear. We had been hiking for what seemed like way too long--we needed to find the trail back to the beginning (this was a loop hike). Obviously having good reason not to trust our sense of time passage, we continued further down the beach, and eventually M started to get worried too. We soon began getting extremely anxious about our situation... there simply wasn\'t time to get back to the first part of the trail before night and the tide trapped us. We seriously thought we might die out there, or have to spend the night freezing in strange and dangerous wilderness forest.     I continually thought I saw trailheads in the distance, which turned out to be nothing. At the peak of our fear--certainly intensified by the LSA--we came upon some backpackers, though from a distance I refused to believe it could really be people. This was extremely unlikely at the location; we\'re very lucky. We were very, very worried and must have seemed crazy to these guys. They told us we had hiked way too far and how to find the return trail. It was dark by the time we found it and were forced to hike three miles by flashlight. Visuals really intensified here in the pitch blackness. After finding the backpackers, our moods increased greatly and we were simply happy to be alive.     We made it back safely around 9pm. I had seriously overexerted myself, hiking 15 miles at a brisk pace after eating nearly nothing that day. I could hardly stay awake, started feeling tingling in my hands and feet, and then puked everywhere. This was probably due to the physical stress rather than any effects of the HWBR. Even by this time, lingering mental effects made sleep difficult despite our exhaustion.    Overall, this was definitely an experience! Other than that horrible period of well-deserved anxiety, the trip was positive, insightful, and really made me appreciate the value of life. We were somewhat surprised by the intensity of this average dose of HWBR and were glad we hadn\'t taken a higher dose, as we had considered. We probably would\'ve freaked out even more and not known what to do. There\'s nothing like putting yourself in actual physical danger while on psychedelics."
31655,A Bad Idea,DevilDoc</A,"Jan 12, 2007","H.B. Woodrose, Syrian Rue & 5-MeO-DPT","I promised myself I would never submit a post-post-trip report (one long after the trip itself), but after reading the post Admenuem about an experience with Syrian Rue, Mushrooms & 5-MeO-DMT, I had to submit this.    About two years ago I had in my possession Syrian Rue, HBWR seeds & 5-MeO-DPT. I had tried 5g Syrian Rue and 25mg 5-meo-dpt on a prior occasion with little to no effects, and also the HBWR with no appreciable effects at all. So on one lonesome Saturday night, at about 9pm, I decided (for no reason at all) to try all three together. I ground up 10g Serian Rue and 8 HBWR seeds. I divided both into 2 equal parts, and put them into capsules. I also put 25mg 5-meo-dpt into its own cap. I downed the equivalent of 5g Syrian Rue and 4 HBWR seeds on an empty stomach, and the rest (another 5g Syrian Rue, 4 HBWR seeds, and 25mg 5-meo-dpt) 30 minutes later. I waited and about 15 minutes after the second ingestion I started to feel \'something\'.    It came on in subtle waves at first, but within 30 min of starting to feel the effects (1 1/4 hours after swallowing the first capsule) I knew something was horribly wrong. Now I have had my share of experiences before - everything ranging from weed, alcohol, DXM and Nitrous to mushrooms, tryptamines, phens and the mother of all entheogens... Salvia. And yes, I do consider Salvia to be, in my opinion, the most extreme drug, regardless of its legal availability here in the states. This, while not as extreme as Salvia, was the most profound experience of my life... if only I could remember it.    MY salvia experiences were the most important of my life, but this experience was the most profound. If only I had retained memory of it, it probably would have been infinitely important. What I do remember is weird and enticing, but the physical and post-trip consequences sucked!     I came to, who knows when, lying on my bed making \'WHAAA, WHAAA, WHAAA, WHAAA\' sounds, with my head spinning out of control, and I remember making those sounds for at least a minute (who knows how long I made them while out of it), and then it hit me - almost literally. I felt as though I got hit in the head as I made, what seemed then, as the most important realization of all time... the meaning of life. I won\'t go into the thought, as it was subjective and most probably not a valid conclusion (not to mention that I don\'t remember it at all, such a shame). But I can still feel how important the realization felt to me.     Next thing I know it\'s the next morning, and I\'m still in bed. My room is in shambles - almost like there was a wild animal set loose on it while I was asleep. Just about all my furniture is turned over, and anything else out in the open was broken or strewn about. Oh, and I guess at some point my body decided to purge the poisons, and to this day there is a HUGE dark brown stain that remains (that glows in the dark under blacklite).    This was an entirely unpleasant experience, which would have all been worth while, had I retained memories of what was going through my head. I would not recommend anyone try this combination without a trip sitter, and probably with lower dosages of the drugs involved.     Take care and have fun!"
22448,A Night from Hell,H.,"May 28, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"Last night I ingested seven HBWR seeds, my first experience with a drug of such powerful psychoactive components. I tried to grind off the poisonous outer fuzz and stuff with a nail file, but it was too difficult and I was impatient to start tripping, so I just threw them in a cup of hot water for about twenty minutes and then chewed them up and swallowed them. (I had smoked quite a bit of MJ about five hours before, so my judgement probably wasn\'t the absolute best.) This was at 11:00 PM.    For awhile I tried to watch a movie, but by midnight I was so tired I couldn\'t keep my eyes open anymore. I fell asleep and woke up into a nightmare.    My boyfriend, who knew I had ingested the seeds, called me at 1:06 AM. I will always remember the time because I remember sitting on the edge of my bed staring at the clock and realizing that I had a phone in my hand and not remembering picking it up and answering it, and hearing my own voice speaking in a complete and scary monotone that I had never heard out of my own mouth before. When I got up and walked around, I couldn\'t feel my body, very similar to DXM. I experienced complete ego-death. When I looked in the mirror, the horror I felt at seeing my own reflection is indescribable, simply because I no longer looked like myself. I had no control whatsoever over my face, and it was completely blank and stoned, except for my eyes, which had the hugest pupils I have ever seen and looked absolutely terrified. I couldn\'t control what I was saying into the phone, but my voice was saying in a flat, dead-sounding monotone, \'I\'m so scared. I\'m so scared. I shouldn\'t be this deep. I don\'t belong here.\'    At about 4:30 in the morning, I still wasn\'t coming down. I knew I had to get ready for school, but the nausea that I had been feeling ever since swallowing the seeds wasn\'t only not going away, it was getting worse. My body was revolting against the intrusion, and if I hadn\'t been numb I suppose I would have been in a lot of pain. Finally, when I took a sip of water, the dam broke. I immediately began vomiting, so quickly I couldn\'t even make it to the trash can, and threw up all over the floor and my backpack and even my dresser a couple of feet away. Over and over again, I threw up, until finally I was vomiting so forcefully that it was forced out the other end as well. I somehow made it to the bathroom after that. For about an hour and a half solid my body threw these seeds out of itself in any and all ways possible. When I could finally move without intense, crippling nausea and intestinal pain, I staggered around cleaning up and finally dropped into bed at about 6:00 AM. I skipped school today, of course, using a cold I\'ve had for a few days as an excuse.    More than twenty-four hours later, I am still incredibly weak. I\'m also dehydrated, slow, and uncoordinated, and my body feels about three times heavier than it should be. I would give almost anything to have not taken these seeds, not just for the absolutely horrifying physical side effects, but for the terror of the bad trip."
12949,"A Mild, yet Very Interesting Trip",Bat Country,"May 4, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"My friends and I have started using HBWR seeds.  They have turned out to have many different (and quite pleasent) effects, with only one major and one minor side effect(s).     I like to take light doses of just about anything, especially when starting with something new. I have a faily light tolerence, which is offset slightly by my weight.  So 5 seeds for me.  Forgive me as I don\'t remember the exact times of the night... We took our doses at about 8:30 - 9:00 pm.  For the first hour or so there is mostly a slight stomach discomfort, with a bit of giddiness. The next stage there is a feeling of being real lazy, yet content.  This lasts anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour.  During this time, I realized that if I wanted to, I could \'snap out\' of it and become very active.      That is the overall feeling of the seeds, this up and down gentle roller coaster effect,  a moment of sluggishness, followed by a period of mental racing.     After the physical effects, there is usually a period of empathy/general agreement between others.  Conversations tend to start out as two different things, only to be mended into one concept about halfway through.  (We call this tree branch effect. Two trees start out as saplings planted apart. But as they grow, their branches intertwince and meet, forming a single outline/shape.) This makes these for me a substance I do as a group.  Sort of a mental X. My mind races for the rest of the night, well on into morning, around 5:00 am or so.  I only sleep 2 hours after these things, so burnout is a major problem.  The next day all I can do is sit around and nap.       I never become so screwed up that I can\'t recall all the neat ideas from the night before.  This is the major up for these. I\'ve never had a bad experience yet."
24986,Let Your Night Light Curl and Caper,ignatius mouse,"Apr 3, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"Some time ago, on a perfect summer evening, I dropped by my old roommate\'s flat.  He\'s a bit of a self-declared shaman, and soon enough he was showing off his latest acquisitions: bags of this and that \'ritualistic incense\' derived from ancient Mesoamerican ritual preparations.  Or at least that\'s what the labels claim.  He also had a sizeable quantity of H. B. Woodrose seeds; earlier that day he\'d removed their shells and torched off the fuzz.  My curiosity piqued, I decided I\'d try them.      I followed his instructions and used sandpaper to strip the seeds, also employing a Swiss Army knife\'s file to handle the awkward bits.  He dug out a kitchen igniting tool to burn the seeds\' fur.  The clock was striking 17:30 when we swallowed our seeds; he had eight and I had seven.  Within forty minutes I was experiencing faint nausea pangs.  A bite of sugared ginger made them go away, either because the spice is inherently medicinal or I was so busy figuring out its odd taste that I couldn\'t pay attention to my stomach anymore.  My current roommate, a woman a few years older than I, had a sudden craving for a cold lemonade, the kind they serve to tourists, all slushy with lemon bits floating in it. We left the apartment and tried to find the nearest tourist trap.      We found a truck on the park\'s edge which sold the sort of goodies we sought.  I had a vanilla ice-cream cone, choosing that flavor over chocolate because I didn\'t want a flavor I really enjoy being ruined coming back up.  As it turns out, the nausea didn\'t return, and my GI tract handled the dessert fine.  I first noticed myself distinctly removed from baseline (other than nausea) when I stood up to throw my paper napkin away.  My legs felt buzzy when I put weight on them, not quite the muscle tension I get from 2C-phenethylamines but similar. Soon the same feeling entered my back and traveled up my spine.  A bit like the enkephalin thrill from really good music, more or less.  The park\'s celebrated pond was reflecting postcard-perfect streetlamps.  My roommate and I were trying to articulate the odd appearance the reflections were assuming when a Hare Krishna walked by.  Our sober friend reassured us that he wasn\'t a white-robed hallucination.      By T + 1:30, the sun was down and all three of us were lounging in the grass.  \'Every ten minutes I feel the world\'s heartbeat,\' my old roomie said.  Myself, I felt a sensation not quite like anything since my first LSD trip: the happiness I can get anytime from good company in a quiet park settled upon me and grew into an inescapable euphoria.  Tree leaves overhead hung like specimens in an exotic crystal garden, as if an eyedropper had squeezed thousands of droplets which solidified into fractal fronds as they fell.  The sodium-vapor lamps shining through the trees would\'ve been pleasant any night, but with LSA it was inescapable.  I felt inseperable from all the beautiful things I saw.  I was supremely confident.  My new roommate recited a play she once wrote about starfish beached during a storm.  We applauded with enthusiasm.  From the park we three walked to another friend\'s place, taking a route through a Victorian-esque district.  Time seemed improbably dilated, stretched out like each block was a kilometre long and we were floating on helium-filled legs.  Every once in a while I would catch my friend\'s tripping eye, and we would share a look:  \'Is this happening to you, too?  Oh, yes.  Oh, wow.\'      I find I can describe 2C-phenethylamine visuals fairly easily, but LSA/LSD gives me more trouble.  A good part of the visuals involved not being able to take in an entire field of view at once.  Most of what I saw seemed fairly stable, but the information pouring in was so rich that I couldn\'t process more than a segment at a time.  At our destination, our mutual friend was sitting at her computer, watching \'Young Frankenstein\' while draped across a young man\'s lap.  I couldn\'t handle much of the movie; by the time Frahnk-en-steen meets Eye-gor in Transylvania, my sensory data was once again too rich for me and I decided to find someplace quiet.  I made a mistake here.  I found a computer and used the Internet\'s magic to pull up an artistic project I\'ve been hacking away upon for several months, and I looked over the work I\'d done.  For a while all was fine.  And then, at T + 3:00, I lost my confidence.  I suppose anybody who puts heart and soul into a project can feel rotten when it doesn\'t work out right.  On seven seeds\' worth of LSA, when I lost confidence I hit the floor with a bone-splintering thud. Just as in the park I had been unified with everything wonderful, at that keyboard I shriveled to a cipher.  It was not enjoyable.  For perhaps half an hour, I jittered and trembled in the midst of the worst trip I\'ve had in my psychoactive career.  A subjective measure, I know.      During this time I noticed the strongest visuals, when I was staring at a tile floor.  The squares went dark and light in twitching, seasick patterns, and I had the distinct impression I would soon go mad, exactly like Nabokov\'s chessplayer Luzhin in his novel \'The Defense\'.  I pulled myself together in the most un-Zen way.  \'I\'m going to flip out like Luzhin,\' I said to myself.  \'But wait, I only know about that because I read a book, because I took in those words.  Words mean that much to me.  I can verbalize.  I can do it well.\'  I started rambling to my old roommate.  \'I\'m going to feel confident again.  Dammit, I am!\'  When I seemed a little more solid, I kept talking, affirming and re-affirming my ability to put words together and communicate.  I felt better still as time passed, either because the LSA was wearing off or because my jabbering did my mind good.  I chose to believe both.      By T + 4:00, I felt almost back to where I\'d been in the park, two hours earlier.  Visuals were more noticeable: footprint scuffmarks on carpet spread out and moved themselves around.  Those forty or fifty minutes of self-annihilated abyss still hung around me, never quite out of touch.  I\'m grateful I had a sympathetic pair of ears nearby to receive the jabbering which kept me stable until I was baseline enough to trust myself to go to bed.  I won\'t joke about this:  I was terrified that without some external input I could center myself upon, I would lose it again.  If I ever wanted to filibuster the Senate, I might try this drug again.  I would certainly be able to spout volumes, giving my best histrionics to anything in sight.  At T + 2:00, I wanted to bring these seeds to all my fraternity friends.  Now I\'m not so sure."
16146,Blue Aura,Greyshadow,"Jul 21, 2005",H. B. Woodrose & Salvia divinorum,"Setting: My apartment    Date/Time: Sunday March 18, 2001 5:45 pm    Preparation: Salvia in hand rolled cigarette, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seed coats were nicked with a razor and left to soak in water for 12 to 16 hours. Seed coats were then removed with tweezers.    5:45 pm: Ate 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.    6:30 pm: Ate another five HBW seeds for a total of ten (10). No major effects felt yet.    7:45 pm: Very strong sexual feelings felt.    8:45 pm: Hand rolled approximately 60 milligrams Salvia Divinorum 5x extract into a cigarette. Have decided to smoke this while watching \'Who Wants to be A Millionaire\' show on TV.    9:30 pm: Smoking Salvia 5X extract - Words will fail to convey what took place after smoking Salvia. It can best be compared to what happens during a DXM experience (dextromethorphan). Reaching the second or third plateau of DXM is a powerful experience. Yet this shift of consciousness takes two or three hours to occur. Smoking Salvia is in many ways similar to the third stage of DXM yet a shift of consciousness takes place in only a few seconds.    There were two distinct \'shifts\' of perception. First my eyesight (of physical objects) blurred and doubled. Strange images (energy?) were visible with my eyes open. So I began to distrust my physical eyesight. It was then a good idea to sit down.   While going into a light hypnologic reverie I looked down at my body. I saw two distinct layers of energy. I believe these layers to be my inner and outer auras. More noticeable was a dark blue \'rippling\' pattern. Beneath that was a lighter, smoky blue energy. I could feel energy pulsate. This deep, otherworldly state lasted twenty minutes.    It took another thirty minutes to come down from a serene transcendental state. I began to think again about my physical surroundings. Time slowed down dramatically. It seemed to be 1:30 am yet was only 11:00 pm.    11:00 pm: Went into a deep meditative state that felt very good. I felt a strong power to be very close.    11:30 pm: Ate two spoonfuls of nutmeg and focused on physical health."
14952,More Intuitive?,Ninni,"Apr 12, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"I recently tried H.B.W. for the first time. And after reading many other people\'s written experiences, my expectations were low.  I was expecting it to be a very mild 8-hour mild LSD-like trip. Boy, I was in for a pleasant surprise!!! I took 10 seeds and crushed them to a powder and added to a cup of warm water in a bottle, and shook and shook and let sit for 2 hours. Then I drank it and swallowed the pulp that remained at the bottom of the bottle.  Then it was time for me to go to work.        I work at a home for the severely mentally handicapped. I know this sounds \'Bad\'... going to a job in which I care for the mentally-retarded while under the influence of an intoxicating plant.  But I can tell you that my \'intoxication\' of HBW did not interfere with my responsibility of properly caring for the mentally retarded residents.  In fact... I found that I could care for them better... I could better understand... I was more intuitive to their needs.    I started to feel the first effects of the HBW after only 15 minutes after ingesting. (I had an empty stomach) I first noticed a \'dreamy and sedated\' feeling.    What seemed odd to me is how the \'mentally retarded\' residents responded towards me. It\'s as if they knew that I was somehow different. They were more loving towards me.  They laughed more than I have ever seen them laugh.  And somehow I felt that we were mysteriously communicating better telepathically. (none of the residents I work with are capable of communicating verbally)    They were all more \'energized\' when I was with them. And they were more happy than what they normally are.  I know this was not my mind playing tricks on me.  Other employees also noticed that all the mentally retarded residents were being more loud and hyper and happy this day. SO I know it was not just all in my mind.        Well, I had a hard time trying to keep a straight face.  It was hard to keep a permanent smile from my face.  I was afraid other employees would notice that I was smiling too much.    I have done LSD and mushrooms before on numerous occasions. And I personally think that HBW is most similar to shrooms.  I had that same feeling in my heart and solar-plexus, that warm fluttering feeling. And the trees outside seemed more alive and the earth seemed to be more alive and everything was beautiful and perfect.  I noticed every detail in everything I saw.     Walking home from work was very magical, with the shadows on the road of the branches of the trees dancing gracefully in the light of the full-moon.  And the moon-light was pulsating like a strobe-light.    I saw a fairee light here and there that would fly up into a great old tree. I can best describe these \'fariee\'s\' as being blue sparks that fly around. I used to see them regularly before I reached puberty. And now for the first time since my childhood... I could finally see them again.        My trip lasted a good 12 hours.  And though it was mellow... it was quite intense.  And the peak that I got from HBR lasted longer than any LSD I done.  Though the visuals were not as intense as LSD... the spiritual and mental effects from HBR exceeded the effects of any LSD I have done."
19946,A Really Strong Buzz,Raoul,"Dec 7, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"14:15 - 4 Seeds crushed with pliers and placed in about 100 mL of water in plastic container    14:23 - Ugly water suspension put in mouth with dregs remaining in plastic container.    14:26 - Ugly water suspension swallowed. Rest of the dregs discarded.    14:30 - Very hard head buzz. Is this real or is it just my mind playing games with me? I can\'t tell. It feels very strong. I don\'t think that my mind could make me feel like this.    14:59 - Okay. My head is really buzzing hard. I feel very spaced out. Nothing spacially, visually, aurally, none of that. But my head is really starting to fuzz.    15:31 - Still fuzzing, only a little harder. Slight discomfort in the abdomen. Vision starting to get a little blurred. Colour enhancements? I can\'t tell. I want to say yes, but again, this whole thing could be in my head. Or is it? I feel like I want to eat some yogurt.    16:20 - Abdominal discomfort is mostly gone. Feel very antsy, like I want to go out and do something. Vision is more blurred, and I keep on thinking that this is the beginning of something, but I think this is it. I didn\'t put the seeds in water for that long. I think I would have vomited if this had been a real dose. I want to stretch and smile really big. I\'m going to read a book for a while.    16:44 - I really want to go do something. I\'m contemplating smoking a cigarette. (This would, of course, entail leaving and getting some at the gas station.) I\'m eating a little yogurt now that I feel comfortable enough putting something else in my stomach. I think I\'m going to head out soon.    16:51 - Bad case of diarrhea. Very uncomfortable.    17:15 - Back on the road to destination.    17:48 - Stop at a park to smoke a cigarette while listening to Disc 2 of \'The Wall.\' There are very slight distortions in spacial perception, and maybe some colour changes and shifts, but in general, this whole thing has just been a mild head trip. I feel very tired.    18:30 - I go to the house to have dinner, and it tastes very good. I can\'t eat as much as I usually do, but it\'s very good. My head stopped fuzzing after supper. By this point, I taste the metallic-LSD-taste on my tongue. Very weird.    19:30 - Listening to the Beach Boys - their later stuff. Man, they were so talented. As I listen with my eyes closed, little patterns of light enter my vision screen and dance with the music. Very subtle, though. It\'s almost as if they just sneaked their way into my psyche and then when I noticed them, they would go away. Music sounds very nice, but then again, I\'ve always loved the Beach Boys.    21:00 - Back to baseline and goig to bed. Fun, except for the bout in the bathroom. Will try again soon, with a higher dose, and will try not to swallow the stuff, but rather let it sit in my mouth for as long as I can hold it and then spit it out. I will probably grind the seeds better too.    Retrospective: Overall, it was too small a dose to really enjoy. The discomfort would have been worth it if I had had a more intense trip. I didn\'t really want to trip hard anyway; I really wanted to test out the waters, and I think I did okay. The next time, it will be more seeds, more finely ground, no swallowing, and I\'ll be starting the whole process early in the morning. Looking forward to it."
21450,"Great, Cheap, Legal Time",curious george,"Nov 16, 2004",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue,"To begin with, i\'ll give my drug history: I am 22, and have been taking LSD, mushrooms, smoking pot, and drinking since I was 17. I have dabbled in other drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy, and mescaline, but that\'s unimportant. I\'ve taken hallucinogens with some regularity, especially in high school and early college, when I tripped at least once a month, with a few gaps of three or four months, but lately I\'ve found good hallucinogens hard to get. So I got some HBWR seeds and syrian rue.     I ground up the rue and swallowed it, and followed that with 11 seeds. I was surprised that about 15 minutes after ingestion the room began to glow and pulsate and shimmer, just like 15 minutes after dropping acid. I felt lethargic, heavy, like I\'d just eaten a huge undercooked burger, but I felt the wierd psychedelic stupor-weight that comes with mushrooms early on. In retrospect I believe this was all harmaline working on me, judging from what I\'ve read of its onset time and effects. The first two hours were spent watching a clock, telling myself \'I\'ll puke in 5 minutes, I just have to keep it down for 5 minutes.\' After I realized that it had been in me for 2.5 hours and that I was tripping \'balls\' as they say, I excused myself and went into the bathroom. I puked immediately and intensely, more intensely than I have ever puked in my life. My blood pressure skyrocketed and my whole body burnt with a cold sting. I could taste the tiny bits of rue in my mouth, which made me puke more. My vision spiraled into a nightmare kaleidoscope, than I thought \'hey, you just puked. You\'re not freaking out, it\'s not the drug, you never feel good when you\'re puking\'.     I laid down on the floor and breathed for a few minutes. The moment I began this activity I felt a million times better. I felt as light as the ether, no more raw beef to hold me to this mortal coil. I jumped up and brushed my teeth and burst back into my living room, ranting to my friend about being purged of all evil and sin and whatnot, and from there on out it was a fun informative trip. We walked around outside in the snow, and my yard looked like the frozen world of Endor miles below me. The bushes and trees in my garden looked like exploding fireworks frozen in the moment of climax. Later on we watched a clockwork orange with Wish You Were Here, Dark Side of the Moon, and Animals (in that order) for a soundtrack. It was amazing...PRT Deltoid (alex\'s truant officer) appears with the sleazy Have a Cigar and pulls alex\'s hair back, cruelly muttering \'and did we tell you the name of the game, boy?\' in his ear. The thematic relations worked amazingly, and I realized many things about the movie that had gone unnoticed for years.    I tried this same combination a month later, but the results were scarier, due almost solely to the fact that, for purely circumstantial reasons, I felt distant from my girlfriend, emotionally...anyway, I was watching Nosferatu with the Delgado\'s new album as a soundtrack, and the brilliant cinematography of the film combined with the despair-laden lyrics like \'hate is all you need\' made me feel like all of the seething emotions of the world were all around me, engulfing me. I had to turn the music and movie off because I felt as if I was drowning in this mess, especially when, for a split second, I truly and honestly believe that I mentally and emotionally transformed into my girlfriend, and directly experienced her pain. It freaked me out. After that I chilled out, smoked some dope, and went for a walk in my back yard. Then, a youthful enthusiasm siezed me, I grabbed my coveralls and a sled. I went sledding, then lay on my back on a frozen pond (terrified it would crack but knowing home was a minute away). The park looked like a japanese painting, all white, just a slight whisp of a brush stroke to indicate a leaveless winter tree.     So those are what I feel to be the important facts of my HBWR-huasca experiences so far. I have tried HBWR alone, a week after my first combo trip, but I fear I didn\'t space the two far enough apart...I got a weak trip, so I got drunk and high on top of it. It was great fun, but I don\'t think I need to go into that.     This is dirt cheap (about $1.50 per trip by my records) and legal, so I say fuck breaking my back looking for street hallucinogens that may or may not be real, I\'ve had great luck with HBWR and San Pedro cactii."
35231,Enjoying Nature At It\'s Best,Nature Gal,"Jul 18, 2004",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose,"My boyfriend and I decided to try these seeds, not knowing what to expect really. After some trial and error, this last experience was fabulous. To prepare them, I crushed them and soaked them in 1/2 C. hot water for 1 hour. The liquid was green, had some small chunks, and kind of tasted like dirt. Before drinking the liquid, we each took 3 TUMS on an empty stomach. Also smoked some Kind right before, and immediately after. Also smoked throughout the night. Neither of us had any naseau or cramping. We each took 11 seeds at 5:30pm. The effect didn\'t take long to start, about 30-45 min went by and my energy level increased and mood was very happy, and free. My boyfriend on the other hand got sleepy and groggy. After an hour of this, he too felt the same as I. We stayed home during the entire experience, listening to music, had incredible sex, and enjoyed the outdoors. We live in the country, so it was peaceful and calm, but our energy was amazing. Colors were brighter, food tasted better, it was everything like an LSD trip. Exactly like that. It was an incredible feeling for several hours. We noticed normality again around 1am. Slept very well that night and felt great in the morning. Definately a worthwhile seed! Enjoy!"
31746,More Intense Than I Expected,Gandalf,"Mar 11, 2004","H.B. Woodrose Seeds, Cannabis & Oxycodone","At about noon I took seven of the small seeds and scraped off the outside, then chewed them up one at a time and swallowed them with water. I hadn\'t eaten anything yet that day, but after about 15 minutes I started feeling very nauseous so I drank some ginger ale and smoked a small bowl of weed. I laid down on my bed to try to get rid of the nausea.    Now before I get into the actual trip I want to say that before doing these I was expecting a mild trip with only like a body high and maybe some CEVs. I\'ve done mushrooms before and wasn\'t expecting these to be anything like them.  I was wrong.    After about 30 minutes of laying down the nausea went away, and I could start to distinguish the LSA from the weed. I closed my eyes and just let my mind wander...I had incredibly vivid CEVs that were just randomly popping into my head. They weren\'t strange images, just normal things like houses and trees, but the sharpness, for lack of a better word, of them was what made them cool.    After about an hour of this I decided to open my eyes and see what was going on. At this point I was VERY messed up and had no idea what was going on. I was still laying on my bed, and I was just staring at the one side of my room. I started to do this cool thing where I would focus on a point and pull it towards me. For example, I was focus at the spot where my wall and ceiling met and pull with with my mind. I went about doing this to the whole side of my room until it was completely 2 dimensional.    I got bored of that and decided to go on the computer.     I was just browsing PM and stuff, don\'t really remember. I played some games, but pretty much I was just enjoying how nice my body felt. My legs started hurting so I got up and walked downstairs to get a drink. I had zero motor skills and almost fell down the steps. I stumbled into the kitchen and tried to pour myself some OJ. I spilled it everywhere and nailed my teeth and lip when I tried to take a drink. I crawled back upstairs and went to the bathroom (I ended up pissing like 9 times throughout the trip for some reason). After all this moving around my legs were burning horribly and were so cramped up so I laid down again and played with my dog.     At this point I seemed to shrink and everything got very large. My dog seemed like a huge beast even though he\'s a 20 lb Jack Russel Terrier. I noticed that my vision was real weird. Everything was glowing, and I had some major tracers. One of my favorite parts of the trip was this thing that happened where my vision became \'low-resolution\'. Imagine turning down the resolution on your comp to like 300 x 400. Thats what everything looked like...big and grainy. My vision stayed like this for the rest of the day.    I kept hearing a car pull into my driveway but everytime I got up to look there was nothing there. I looked across the street at my neighbors white garage which was like a huge white blur. There were shadows on it that looked like people, but I couldn\'t find out where the shadows were coming from.    At this point I had to talk to my mom on the phone. Wow did that suck. I had no idea what was going on and was slurring my words. I told her that I had been sleeping and just woke up and she bought it.    I went in the bathroom and looked at my pupils. Holy **** they were massive. I kept turning off the lights then turning them back on and watched my pupils expand and contract. After that I went in my room and snorted about 5mgs of oxycodone. This produced these awesome waves of warmth and pleasure on my body and made me so relaxed.    About 4 hours had gone by, and the most intense part of the trip was over. For the next 4 hours though I was still having weird vision, CEVs, and audio hallucinations. My dad came over for like 15 minutes and I just got into bed and made sure he didn\'t look at my eyes and tired to concentrate on talking right.     For the rest of the night I had low-dosage DXM-like effects. For some reason I couldn\'t get comfortable and my arms and legs were cramping real bad. I did some more oc and listened to music and went to bed. I had a good sleep and when I woke up I had the usual post-trip haziness. I felt very satisfied with my life and everything.     For some reason I got a horrible headache that didn\'t go away until about an hour ago. Overall the trip was very fun, but with some real bad side effects (cramping and nausea). I easily matched some of my shroom trips in intensity which I wasn\'t expecting at all.    LSA is a cool drug, but I\'d rather do mushrooms or acid as soon as I get some. Worth trying once, but I probably won\'t do it again just because of the headache I had the next day.    SUMMARY: Trip was fun, vivid CEVs and aural hallucinations, cool vision alterations. Bad side effects such as cramping and nausea."
26410,These Precious Seeds - Informative Experiment,Josh,"Dec 30, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"Me and my wife have chewed and swallowed seven of these seeds each on two different occasions. The first time we did not scrape off the fuzzy coating, the second time we did, as we had heard that this may make a difference to the level of toxicity. Having conducted this relatively controlled research we can say that scraping off the coating did not appear to make a significant difference.     On both occasions we began to feel a sense of anxiety and nausea shortly after taking the seeds - in short a sense of being poisoned. Though it would have been possible for us to hold them down we chose instead to purge (vomit in an exorcist-like fashion) within the first couple of hours of ingesting the seeds.    Subsequently we enjoyed the effects of the LSA without any further complications from the cyanogenic glycosides (?) in the seeds. I would say that LSA is very similiar to LSD, though possibly gentler and more unreservedly pleasant. It lasts a good ten hours on this kind of dose and seems to pass more naturally into sleep than acid.    I have found that doses as low as one seed can produce noticeable results, including both the nausea and the pleasant effects. I have never vomited on doses of one to four seeds, but without purging there is definite yet subtle background sense of being poisoned even on these low doses.    NB: Treat with caution. Have tried sub-lingual method mentioned elsewhere  with three or four seeds - still felt somewhat poisoned, though is an improvement. Proper extraction definitely worth a go as this is a very sacred substance."
25702,Easy Preparation,Gnostikoi,"Dec 23, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'ve been reading some of the HBWR reports, and I saw a lot of complicated ways of preparing them.  I really couldn\'t say whether it increases the potency of them to perform all kinds of extractions, etc., on them, but I\'ve used them a few times in a really simple way that\'s been perfectly adequate.    When I use them I take five seeds, stick them in a teacup with about a cup of water, and microwave them for 45 seconds.  Then I fish the seeds out, chew them up thoroughly, and wash them down with the water.  That\'s it.  After the brief microwaving they\'re soft enough to chew without any problem, and although they\'re slightly bitter the taste is really not all that unpleasant - they sort of remind me of peanuts.    Two things I should point out are:    1.  The source that I buy my seeds from guarantees that they are not treated with pesticides or other chemicals.  That\'s why I don\'t bother with scraping the outer skin off.  If you\'re unsure about this, you may want to take the time to do that step.    2.  Every time that I\'ve taken them I\'ve experienced some nausea.  Typically I will throw up once or twice.  This doesn\'t bother me - it\'s not violent projectile vomiting like what I\'ve experienced with ayahuasca and AMT, and it doesn\'t go on for very long.  I consider it a minor cost of the trip.  If you really hate throwing up, you might want to try one of the more complicated preparations, although it seems to me like many people go through a whole lot of steps and end up throwing up anyway.  Up to you.    As far as the experience, I really enjoy LSA.  It\'s something that I like to do alone - the first time I tried it was with other people, and I ended up retreating to a bedroom upstairs by myself.  I like to find a comfortable place to lay down and just watch the ceiling tiles move around.  It\'s much less intense than LSD, at least at this dosage, but I find it actually more pleasant in many ways - something about it seems somehow warmer, softer, and gentler.  For me, it\'s an extremely sensual drug; not particularly in a sexual sense, but in the sense that I\'ll end up slowly writhing around on the bed just because it feels GOOD to move.  Fun stuff."
17370,These Were a Lot of Fun,Gnostikoi,"Dec 23, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first time trying HBWR seeds.  I\'ve had them around the house for quite a few months, but I hadn\'t got around to trying them.  I\'ve taken LSD many, many times, although not in the past few years, so I was curious about LSA.      I put my seeds in a cup of water and microwaved them on high for three and a half minutes.  Then I ate the seeds (which didn\'t taste too bad, actually) and washed them down with the water.  I felt the effects coming on within 10 minutes.  Within 30 minutes I was vomiting, which lasted for probably 15 or 20 minutes.  It was unpleasant, of course, but not unbearable.      By the time I was done vomiting, I was noticeably tripping.  My eyes were extremely dilated and I found it very difficult to move.  At first, the sensation was exactly like LSD, but as the experience progressed I decided that it actually reminded me more of MDMA.  I had the same little rushes of pleasure, and a sort of warm, \'everything is OK\' glow.  I got only a very few slight visual distortions, but the other aspects of the experience were very enjoyable and I didn\'t mind the lack of OEVs.  I am planning on trying a higher dose to see if I can get some OEVs with these, but I will not be all that disappointed if it doesn\'t work because they are a lot of fun even without visuals.    One other thing that reminded me of MDMA is that I had a highly sexual response to LSA, whereas with LSD I was usually unable to perform (I know that this is not true for everyone, but it was for me).  When the kids went to sleep my mate and I spent two and a half hours joined at the hips, so to speak, and it was an intense and wonderful experience for both of us (my girlfriend was sober, but said that the intensity I displayed made the experience special for her, too).      The very best part to me, though, was that with LSA I was able to fall asleep after about five hours.  The main drawback of LSD for me was always that I couldn\'t fall asleep for 15-20 hours afterwards.  I slept about 10 hours and felt a little out of it the next day, with a sore throat (probably from the vomiting) and sore muscles, but NOTHING near as bad as with LSD.  Nice...    So I will definitely be trying these again, and I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys LSD, provided that they don\'t mind a little bit of purging at the beginning of the trip."
27165,Some Powerful Seeds,Mark,"Dec 21, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"I have had one previous experience with HBWS, where I ground up 5 seeds, soaked in water, then held the mixture in my mouth for 20 minutes (as I heard it can be taken sublingually).  I swallowed half the mixture, spat the rest out, than chewed up one more seed directly for a total of 6.  This entry dose gave me a warm euphoria that was particularly brought out with bong hits, lasting for the better part of a day (8-10 hrs). It also allowed me to review myself from a heightened perspective, and my mindset on everything was boosted with added insight.  Only minor distortion in visuals to speak of, and only slight nausea at the onset (first 2 hrs, went away with cannabis). Overall it was quite pleasant, and I looked forward to trying them again.    My next venture with HBWS would prove to be far more intense.  Me and 2 others ate 7 seeds, chewing them.  A fourth person also ate 5 seeds along with us.  Everyone felt a heavy feeling in their stomach for the first hour or two, and one 7-seed kid felt terrible and tried to force himself to throw up, with minor success.  I was worried that he would have a terrible experience, as his onset seemed to be much harsher than mine.    Luckily, things improved soon, as I hoped they would.  The heavy stomach and odd body high gradually (and I do mean very gradually) gave way to a strong euphoria and general well-being.  2 bowls of potent cannabis later, and we had completely forgotten about any nausea.  The feeling I experienced was like an intense drunken state without any of the negative effects of alcohol like blurred vision, slurring speech, discoordination or that sort of thing, altho i was kind of disoriented.  The weed boosted its psychological impact, and my mind felt somewhat detached from the body, and speech came without me even thinking about it.  I stumbled along with my friends without any cares whatsoever, social inhibitions dying fast.  One 7-seed friend reported seeing trails and extended light exposure stuff, while the other 7-seed guy (the one who was originally sick) became lost in a sea of gabbering bliss, and said that he could take my face and place it onto a nearby statue and have it talk.  I was jealous, as I was experiencing no visuals.      My 5-seed friend, who was elsewhere, was reportedly on top of the world emotionally, and was going up to ppl being extra-friendly, almost like an MDMA high.  He also reported touching the same statue my friend looked at, and the hand of the statue became warm and touched his hand like a fellow human, according to him.  This lasted from about hour 2.5 to hour 4 after ingestion.      This is where the trip took a sharp turn for me.  About 4 hours after ingestion, I suddenly felt violently ill with a terrible sinking feeling.  I proceeded to run to the bathroom and puke several times, but seconds after I started, my mind quickly traveled away from my puking body and I hardly became aware of it.  I began to grow concerned, as my mental state abruptly began to shift, to what I wasn\'t sure yet.  The next 30 minutes were intensely different than everything before it.  Time in my mind went into overdrive, and real-time slowed to a crawl.  Random thoughts would rush in my head, from imagining pipes rapidly blowing steam, to intense insights about myself and the world around me.  Images would come in as stills, separeted from one another awkwardly like alternating pictures.  My mind kept journeying to other places, traveling infinite directions for what seemed like days.  I never \'saw\' any visuals, but was able to imagine rapid thoughts so quickly and so vividly, it was as if i saw them almost in a different dimension of thought.  I felt a strong shift in reality, and felt as if I was walking around in my dream, traversing the hallways of my inner-consciousness.  After 30 mins I managed to leave the bathroom, feeling a bit better.    I collapsed on my bed (now 4.5 hrs after ingestion) and could barely look at the TV without getting overwhelmed.  My eyes drifted to my poster of \'Dogs Playing Poker\', and in the dim light, all of the dogs started idly moving, shifting their cards around in their paws, pipe smoke drifting upwards, adjusting their chairs right in front of my eyes.      I tried to sleep, but my brain was still racing, and so I just lay there.  I was able to take any abstract concept, like a personal relationship, or God, and manipulate it unlike ever before.  I searched within my past for answers, and was able to come up with new opinions and perspectives for different things I still have now.  These seeds opened my mind up in a different way than any other drug, with slight ego-death properties along with a stream of uncontrollable things, events and locations.  They are fun and quite intense, certainly not just a \'replacement\' for other hallucinogens, but be prepared to get a little sick at higher doses.  I am not doing these again for awhile, but I am glad I did."
27279,A Surprisingly Emotionally Sensitive State,neon green snake,"Dec 3, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"I\'ve experimented with LSA a few times past and I noticed the effects are almost completely different each time. Every time having the same quality to it, but basically, the state of mind produced is circumstantial like with any other psychedelic. I had 20 seeds left and my friend wanted to try them so I agreed to support his curiosity. I arrived at his house at about 3pm and ground up the seeds with a coffee grinder. The house was empty and our plan was to dose and then take his dog for a walk down at the beach in mukilteo. We divided the substance and mopped the powder up with chunks of a pear to decrease the nasty taste. I suggested trying to smoke a small amount on some pot to see what the effects were. By the time we got the bowl loaded though, we were starting to come on to the dose we had already taken so when we smoked it, the pot increased what was already starting to get us high so we were unable to decipher whether or not smoking them did much.     I decided to be a goofball and stuck my nose in the empty baggie and snorted as hard as I could, my desired result be that some of the residue insufflated out of the bag enhanced my trip. That I couldn\'t tell for sure either, though we kept comaparing our state of mind and I was obviously higher than he was the entire time. We were gone for about an hour and a half. 45 minutes into the trip down to the beach clarity had begun to comfort me and time began to slow down to a crawl, like every song on the car stereo seemed like an entire album. The sun was shining and it was beautiful...touching...sceneric...vivid and emotionally potent. I stared at the sunny sky and the vastness of the body of water the entire time. I was in a state of silent bliss. We were walking extremely slow at the park and we quickly got back into the car after we arrived, our excuse being he didn\'t bring any trash bags for the poo. But I know the real reason was that driving and allowing the music to take control of our emotions and inner peace was far more comforting than walking around a bunch of people.    We got back to the house an hour and a half after dosing. My stomach had slowly over the previous 15 minutes become upset and I knew I was going to puke and the amount of willpower and energy and just simply holding the shit down was unbelievable but I managed not to puke in his car but as soon as we got to the house, I stumbled like a drunken idiot to the back yard where no one would see me, bent over and just let it all go. It felt so good, I would have chosen that experience over getting laid at that point in time. Also, as soon as I rid myself of stomach content, my psychedelic state of mind was, literally, enhanced 3 to 5-fold. We settled in, exchanging looks of hysteria, almost telepathically confirming we were both getting high as a kite. He was going to put in BEYOND THE MINDS EYE, but then he found out that I hadn\'t seen HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CORPSES and he immediately changed his mind.     That movie was so fucking weird, and the assumptions and suspense and the overwhelming number of failed premonitions due to the fact that the movie was meant to mislead you at every given chance, was mind blowing and put me in a state of potent grin, and also put me on the edge of uncontrollable laughter, though I kept it down with strength I never knew existed. He kept looking at me with a weird expression every time I made a comment, like I had lost my mind and eventually he said, \'maybe I was supposed to puke, I\'m pretty damn high, but I don\'t fell nearly as high as you LOOK!\' and I predicted truth and sense in his assumption/idea and thought that maybe puking after the substance sat in your stomach for about an hour and a half really DID enhance the remainder of the trip. You know, sorta like \'the more you give, the more you gain.\' well, he mentioned, 1/2 way through the movie, that he wanted to lay down in his bed to get some shut-eye but he never moved from his spot on the couch. I looked over at him like 20 minutes later and he had acquired his \'shut-eye\' right there on the couch just slumped over on his side as if he just snorted 80mg of oxycontin. I finished the movie in silence and mental exhilaration, and he never woke up so I left when the movie was over. I went to my house and grabbed my discman, craving horribly some music I could choose from MY collection and informed my room mate casually that I was in a state of mind equivalent to an acid trip and that if I act weird, ignore me and that I\'m going for a walk to explore the depths of my expanded mentality. I walked around singing like an E-tard, and decided to sit on this majestic looking patch of grass. I sat and I looked around at the sky and the houses and the passerbys and the children running around and the birds and I was thrust into a state that was inundatingly emotionally unstable. I cried. My mind focused on every aspect of the simple factors of life...families just innocently working and getting by, raising children, trying to obtain the the closest to bliss they can manage. The sky was an angel simply there to let me know that everything, no matter how I looked at it, would be OK always. The pros would ALWAYS weigh out the cons.     I looked at myself with pride. I knew that I was completely different than the rest of the human race, which the majority is in fact, dishonest, selfish, etc. I had a mind that was wide open and I acknowledged the fact that I\'m honest and considerate to all people, no matter how fucked up the majority of them were, that everyone was unique in their own way and that life is simply figuring out how to deal with anything and everything thrown at you, that karma has reason/purpose and that I will prevail in the end. I cried out of realization of greatness. I saw the meaning of life right before my eyes as if it were a stone on the side of the road. It was so obvious. I was dumbfounded by the fact that I never realized what I realized at that exact moment. The music only added to emotions. I smiled with such clarity, as tears flowed down my face with grace. I sat there spiraling and swimming around in this epiphany for hours.     The remainder of the night was simply treating everyone with as much respect as I could conjure. \'Eating seeds is a past-time activity\' my perspective is enhanced due to that experience and I definitely recomend that any educated psychonaut explore the depths of the woodrose. Be safe and enjoy life. It\'s too short to be pissed off. Much peace and love.    Sincerely,   Just another flaming soul singing the frays in the fabric of reality with grace"
25524,Loss of Body,artfool,"Jul 24, 2003",H.B. Woodrose,"Throughout my life I have been always held much interest in Mind expanding substances. I have tried LSD and shrooms before and had wonderful experiences. Due to lack of these \'treats\' in the  local market I began exploring different substances that might be more accessible. After researching and finding surprisingly many options I decided that I would give Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. I read as much as possible and finally me and a few friends ordered a pack of seeds.     After anxiously awaiting our package it finally arrived on a Friday (couldnt have been more perfect). We all gathered up at our usually hang out place and I told everyone what they might expect form these seeds and told them as much as I knew. After giving them a stern warning about possible side effects we began to scrape the brown husks off of the seeds. This took quite awhile for some of us. I was the first to finish. I looked at the small pile of seeds in my hand and after a final thought of reassurance I threw them into my mouth. I began to chew. My first thought was \'Oh my god these things are rock hard!\'. After awhile I was able to grind them up in my mouth. I kept the not too-bad tasting stuff in my mouth for a good ten minutes. I finally swallowed the stuff and slammed it down with some sprite. I looked at all my friends who were watching me to see how I was reacting. I kept a cool face through out the process and I think they all got some confidence after watching me do it.     After my friends consumed there amount of seeds we sat around playing video games and listened to some Ben Harper and Pink Floyd. After fifteen minutes of consuming the seeds one of my friends proceeded to puke quite violently. Then one after another every one started to puke. I did not. I hate puking and have sworn it off. I have a tough stomache I guess. After this great \'purge\' from everyone we resumed playing video games. After an Hour and a half or so I began to notice a slight Buzz similar to a light marijuana buzz. I asked my company if they too were experiencing this and they all said they were feeling something. Then we all decided to run to the store and get some supplies. Upon standing up we all felt like we hit a brick wall. I felt drunk! Not so much physically but I was so giddy. I was having a good time. Everyone else appeared to be having just as much fun as I was. I also noted that all were grinning ear to ear. We went to the store and came back with out incident.     When we came back it was about three hours since we ingested the seeds. I was sure we should be feeling more than what we were by this time. After we all sat down and began to mellow out I knew I was definitely feeling something. I have never been so happy in my life! Whimsical thoughts danced in and out of my brain. Then without warning everyone almost simultaniously burst into a fit of laughter. I looked at my friend sitting next to me and his eyes were pure black. I couldnt even tell the color of his eyes. A good sign. Then we all mellowed out again and Soon we were all in the grips of quite a pleasant trip. Not so much visualy was going on but It was a trip. The only way I can describe it is that it was a body trip. It was merely an experience beyond words. In dark places I kept seeing patterning on multiple planes just waving around. We all just kept in our own little world, interaction wasnt really going on.     As the night went on we all tried to sleep once it was getting pretty late. No one could sleep. It was as if I had totally forgotten how. My mind was racing out of control. So much information was flowing into my head. I just couldnt keep up or stop it. After tossing and turning I closed my eyes and then once I opened them it was One o\'clock in the afternoon the next day. I was amazed. I ccouldnt remember any dreams. It simply felt like I had closed my eyes for a mere second. I looked up and all of my friends were sleeping. After everyone woke up we all tried to interpret our trips. No one could explain theres. It was so much of an experience that it just couldnt be explained with words. The only thing I have heard from my friends is that it was life changing. I feel the same way. I walked away from that evening with a new respect for life, family and friends. I also felt closer to my group of friends then i ever had before; a feeling that is absolutly incredible.     Just do your homework and prepare yourself for anything. I dont think any of my friends had anywhere near the same experience. Set and setting are very important factor to this substance. I have used these seeds many times after this experience. I find them to be most therapeutic. In the end. I think I have found what I was looking for and I still dont even know what it is but I know i found it. See you on the Darkside of the Moon. Peace."
24723,Higher Plain Of Spiritual Being,generichumanoidunit,"Jun 23, 2003",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"And the trip begins\x85    Ok so I had order 50 (thought the package I got actually had 60 in it) Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds as well as a 30 bag of weed. The plan was that me and my friend whom I shall call B were going to go over to his house (he lives with his parents) and trip while the rest of his family were up at their cottage. Well because it had been raining all weekend they didnt go. We got the go a head from his mom to chill there and do what ever any ways. So at 9:30 B came over to my house where I had the seeds crushed and ready to be put in some water and drink. We placed our doses into our cups. I told him I was only taking 15 (though I later revealed the truth... I had taken 19), I had crushed up 10 for him. So we drink the water making sure to get all the crushed seeds as well, I made sure to chew mine up real good before swallowing.     We head out and decide to stop to a gas station to pick up a Philly so we could roll a blunt. The gas station that we patron is about 15 min away from my house. Well after about 10 min on the road I could feel my stomach tightening up and nausea setting in. I tried my best to think of something else but all I could think of was not puking, which only made the pain worse. We arrive at the gas station, I asked B to go in because if I stood up I knew I would hurl. It felt like forever that he was in the store; every second I could feel the pain growing. He finally arrived back to the car and we started to head over to his house. The roads seemed so bumpy; every bump we hit made me feel worse. As soon as we get half way back to his house B asked if I was feeling any thing because he was starting to feel his stomach tighten up as well. I just nodded. We arrive at his house and his mom was in the drive way. He got out and walked over to her. They talked for a moment. This got me mildly paranoid. B walked into the house to get something and she just walked past the car and said hello. This made me feel better. Not sure why but it made me feel like I was going to be safe here.     B arrived back to the car and started to roll up a blunt. While he was doing this I had a rushing sensation growing. I was feeling really confined. I got out of the car and took my jacket off. That helped a bit. When I sat back in the car I left the door open, I had to if I shut it I felt like I was going to be stuck in the car. B finished the blunt and I asked if we could smoke in his old van, he said no but we could smoke and walk around his property. B lives out of the city so there is nothing but woods really around us, there is a slight hill that they keep mowed but its still more of a field than a yard... we walked over to a spot amongst some trees. It was kind of closed in but I felt like I was in the middle of a giant field. As we stood there smoking I felt the nausea go away and the rushing sensation take over\x85 (I should note that it was now about 10 pm and it was dark out. It was slightly raining and the ground was completely saturated.)     The world started to glow; every thing seemed to be becoming alive. I started to sense the trees calling me; I started running about from tree to tree greeting each with a hug. B seemed very amused by this. He hadnt started to trip yet, but he would follow me around and keep trying to keep me still. But I was in no way able to stay in the same spot, the world was calling me and I had to answer back. I was laughing uncontrollably at this point, just completely taken over by bliss. I felt as if for the first time in my life I was completely free.    B suggested we head over to a clear spot in some trees on the edge of his property, as we headed over hallucinations really started to take hold. I started to see small animals running through the bushes; the sky turned a greenish color and as we walked up the slight slope to the spot in the trees there was water running down the hill from all the rain and with light from his house at the end of the hill reflecting off the water I became under the impression that the field was a lake. This impression was only intensified by the fact that there is a ditch that runs through a part of this field as a form of run off for the water and for some reason I kept finding my self standing in it knee deep in water; despite Bs greatest effort to keep me out of the ditch.    We finally reached the spot. It was amazing surrounded on all sides by trees and I felt each of them reaching out for me. I was just running around touching all the trees and plants I could; it was as if I could feel their life force.  We were still smoking the blunt at this time; I would guess it was maybe 10:25 to 10:30 pm now, though I am not sure I lost all sense of time. I then stated that I needed to cross the lake to the other side. I am not sure if B realized I had mentioned the lake but he agreed that we should cross the field (note: I will be referring to the field as a lake until the time passes).    We as we headed out of the trees to the edge of the lake I become very worried of drowning. I took step after step at a very slow pace. Even though there was no real water depth I felt that with each step it was getting deeper. By the middle of the lake I felt as if just my head was sticking out of the water. B had already reached the other side of the field and turned around and asked why I was going so slow, I replied that the water was too deep. B just looked at me and asked me to hurry up. I continued my slow progress across the field. Upon reaching the other side I noticed an old swing set that seemed to be a boat. We headed over to it.    B climbed up to a platform and I just climbed up the ladder and hung on. It felt as if my body was under water and my head was just popping out. I am not sure how long we hung out here but it wasnt too long I believe. After this we made our way back to his car in the driveway. This is when the trip got really strong for me. As we sat in the car I got the feeling of confinement again and I started to freak out a bit. I kept jerking and shaking. I think I might have even broken some part of his car, not really sure. I finally realized I had to get out of the car, I would get out of the car and head off back into the trees then return to the car. I did this for while.    I do not really remember much of these little adventures, except that I would come to standing alone in the middle of a small wooded area and find my way back to the car. While I was doing this B was trying to roll a blunt with no luck. He finally gave up and we both decided we should sit in the garage. We sat in there talk and shit. I was having a real hard time sitting though, I wanted to walk. After a half hour or so of trying to keep me sitting B gave in and we headed back to the first spot we went to when we smoked.  I do not remember much of what went on while we were out there this second time.     The next thing I remember is deciding to go inside, which turns out to be a bad idea. As we walked into his basement I felt fine, not confined or anything. But as soon as we got up stairs I started to feel really confined and kind of paranoid. We decided to watch a movie so he put in Ghostbusters. I tired to sit down relax and enjoy the movie but I couldnt sit still. My trip was still at full force. I moved from seat to seat in the living room but I couldnt get comfortable. I started to freak out. I couldnt handle my trip at this point I wanted it to end. I asked B if they had any orange juice because I felt this would help stop the trip (dont know why.. just did) any was he got up and went over to the kitchen. He then walked to see if any one was in the next room (At this point we had thought maybe his sister or some one was up on the computer in this room) and as he went in he stopped looked around and walked in slowly. I started to think maybe his mom was up and was talking to him or something. This made me freak out.    I got really nervous and felt like I was going to threw up. I started to think that we were fucked. Then I started to think of all the bad shit in my life right now and then started to think about having to confront my parents and talking about my use of drugs. B came out of the room and I ask him who was in the room. He told me no one was in the room but this news didnt make me feel any better. The panic had already set in and negative thoughts where now manifesting into physical pain. I told B I had to puke, I ran over to the small bathroom in the other room and shut the door. By this time I had already broke out into a cold sweat and my heart rate had increased ten fold.    I immediately bent over to throw up into the toilet, but nothing came up. I just dry heaved a few times. I leaned my head on a window and rest my self against the wall. I was having all the bad thoughts you can have. I was imagining B panicking and getting his mom or something. Having to go to the hospital getting my stomach pumped (even though I knew they would not do this, it would be of no help). I pictured my self having to talk to my mom at the hospital, how disappointed she would be in me. I started to feel depressed. I felt as if I was dying. I turned around and leaned up on a sink and looked at my self in the mirror. I was white/grey. I looked as if I already was dead. Sweat pouring down my face, my eyes red and all pupil. Thats when I realized it.    I was on drugs and freaking my self out. I stood up, looked at my self and I was ashamed that I let my self get carried away. I started to say to my self its just the drugs, dude you are on drugs... relaxed. I took slow deep breaths. I almost immediately felt better. I opened the door and stepped out. I had stopped sweating but I was soaked. As I slowly made my way threw the kitchen back to the living room a feeling of total bliss and euphoria a million times stronger than I have ever felt started to set in. I sit down on the couch, looked at B and said dude.... you have no idea.... what I just went through.  Just then I knew I had just gone through the worst moment of my life. Everything I can think of up to that point seemed so small in turmoil compared to my 5 min in that bathroom. I was alive and for the first time in my life I was happy to be so.     I was exhausted now but in a state of total relaxation and bliss. I would have to say from this point on the trip took on a feeling of MDMA more than anything else. In the sense that I become very empathetic, I had an extreme mood lift, I felt complete; it was as if every thing in the world was now right. I lost all sense of ego and became very raw and pure emotionally. I really can not explain what I fully felt. The experience was simply beyond my comprehension of reality. It was like I shifted into an entirely different level of existence, a higher plain of spiritual being. For once in life I was living beyond the social BS, I was limited only by my willingness to express my self. I realized all the things in my life that has been keeping me down and I realized that now is the time to change them. It was as if I was supposed to have taken this trip so that I can see how blind I have been in life. It felt as if a weight had been lifted off my soul, a feeling that has stayed with me sense. I learned a lot that night.     The Aftermath    I got home at about 4:30 am that night. I was totally exhausted yet still tripping quite heavily. I was extremely hot and could not cool my self down; I drank plenty of water and had my a/c on full blast. I tired to sleep but with no luck. I did end up falling asleep for a few hours. How ever upon waking I was still tripping mildly. I spent most of Sunday lying in bed coming down. I still wasnt able to sleep much last night and I feel completely fried today.."
22069,Hours of Pain,Lana,"Mar 12, 2003",H. B. Woodrose,"I had ordered a large bag of hb woodrose seeds from a website and had tried them once with very mild results.  The first time that I had taken them I did seven.  This time I decided to crush up ten seeds and soak them in water for an hour.  At 5:00pm I drank the water and ate the seed gunk at the bottom of the glass.  Then I proceeded to play final fantasy for about an hour.  Almost exactly an hour after ingesting I just could not play the game anymore.  My hands and arms felt very heavy and I was having a hard time holding my head up.  I turned off the game and headed to my room to lay in bed for a bit while waiting for a friend to call me to go out.  At this point I almost totally lost track of the time, but this is everything that I can recall.    I started to feel really nauseated, but I wasn\'t really worried.  I tried to get up to go to the bathroom and almost fell over!  The backs of my legs had severly cramped up and I had to limp to the bathroom.  No amount of rubbing or walking could work out the terrible pain in the back of my legs.  When I got to the bathroom I tried to throw up, knowing I would feel better after, but no matter how hard I tried I just could not throw up.  So I dragged myself out of the bathroom and back in bed.  I hadn\'t noticed it happening but my nose had become so stuffed up that I could hardly breath out of it.  My friend call me at a quarter to eight and at that point I had to turn her down.  I was naseated, unable to breathe out of my nose, and I had to pee every five minutes.  The woodrose wasn\'t done with me yet.  Within a half hour I was so dizzy and light-headed that I couldn\'t even sit up in bed.  At one point I got up to use to bathroom and had to crawl the short distance, because if I had walked I would have fainted.  I also had a terrible headache which lasted for all of the next two days.       Throughout the evening none of these bad experiences ever subsided.  It was awful.  Things might have been more tolerable if maybe the nausea or cramping ended, but neither did.  At 10:00pm, right before I passed out into sleep, I was experiencing all of it, plus nothing I looked at would stay still.  I wouldn\'t call it visuals, but everything just seemed to be shifting.  I would stare at a corner of my blanket and it would seem to just be shifting around.      The whole time this was going on I had the gotten into the mindset that it was never going to end.  I thought I was going to continue the awful experience for the rest of my life.  Eventually, I became too worn out and light-headed to even care anymore.  Right before I fell asleep I got up one last time to use the bathroom and nearly fell down while trying to pull my bathrobe out of the closet.  I had been laying around in my underwear because I was feeling too warm in my clothes...exactly how you would feel with a high fever.  I remember spending ten minutes kneeling in front of the toilet just staring into the water during that bathroom trip.  I still could not make myself throw up.  Thankfully, I managed to fall asleep after that (something I had not been able to do up until that point).      It was the worst experience of my life.  Strangely, I haven\'t sworn off woodrose seeds, I will just never do more than five or six ever again.  The physical pain was just too much for me to want a woodrose experience to more than just mild.    One last note:  I know this experience seems like the minority and people might be tempted to ignore it, but the first time I did it I was with three people and two of them had very similiar experiences as my bad one.  One person\'s bad experience only lasted two hours and then became wonderful, but the other person was confined to bed for the rest of the evening.  Neither of them had done any other substance that night.  If you decide to try woodrose be careful!  Don\'t be tempted to take too many on the first try.  Get to know how your body reacts to it first.  Peace"
20802,"Ego Loss, OBE, and the Other Joys of Woodrose",Alkaloidaholic,"Jan 29, 2003",Argeryia Nervosa,"I have ingested woodrose on many occasions. With effects ranging from complete ego-loss to complete bliss and euphoria. It is a powerfull psychedelic indeed! Various seed varieties carry different potencies. [One supplier] carried a variety called Tahitian that proved to be very potent. [Another supplier] Carries a Hawaiian variety of equal potency. Effects can be noticed at one seed.     Usually I would ingest one seed for meditative purposes. I would feel very emotional with strong currents of energy shooting through my body. My first experience with the tahitian variety consisted of 5 seeds. I have never had an entheogenic experience prior to this. I ingested the seeds around 10pm at night and went to sleep. I woke up and had the most frightening experience of my life. I had forgotten that i ingested the seeds the night before. As i tried to walk my body felt as though it was mechanical and it was very hard to move at all. I was terribly frightened that I had gone completely insane. Many idea\'s ran through my head as I tried to comprehend the horrible state that I was in. I had thought that the end of the world had arrived, That I was reincarnated into an alien body, and that i was just completely insane. I started crying and tried to call a friend for help. As i sat and thought I remembered that I ingested the seeds the night before and slowly learned to enjoy the trip.    After that experience I was completely infatuated with the idea of ingesting these seeds and experiencing their power. I ingested 3 seeds a few days later and to verify the dosage and effect. It contains a very strong body high. Walking is most enjoyable. I consumed the seeds many times after this. On another occasion I had forgotten that I swallowed a capsule containing 5 seeds, I have a habit of taking any pill that laying around. After completely freaking out on my girl friend I calmed down and realized that I ingested the sacred seeds. I went over to her house and she allowed me to lay in her bed as she cleaned her room. I found myself slowly leaving my body. I tried to get up and wasn\'t allowed to. My body had been completely seperated from me. I looked up and realised that I was no longer in my body but now inside of hers. Suddenly I began to think her thoughts. I continued to ask her many questions that made her feel quite uncomfortable due to the accuracy(as later comfirmed). This was an amazing learning experience.    \tI find that when I trip in isolation it potentiates disaster. Everything was torn away from me. Everything I had ever known was completely destroyed and I was left alone, bare, scared.... I came to the understanding that everything in this world is completely false and that when you have nothing to busy your mind with your left with only yourself and no comfort.    \tThe seeds can also produce profound euphoria and bliss. Tripping with friends on a nice sunny day usually turns out very nice. The experience usually last around 12 hours and is greatly potentiate with syrian rue or curde extracts thereof. The combination with harmala alkaloids drags the experience out longer, lasting up to 16-18 hours. Woodrose also seems to have somewhat of an accumulative effect, when one ingests more seeds over the course of a trip.    \tWoodrose is a very powerfull teacher. In ayurvedic medicine it is thought to increase intellegence and lower the aging process. Use caution and respect while dealing with this entheogen. Start low. 5 seeds proves to be quite mind warping.  *"
17711,Incredible Stuff,Dave,"Sep 25, 2002",H. B. Woodrose,"After much research, I decided to try Hawaiian baby woodrose.  I bought some seeds off the internet and decided to take a dose of 8 seeds.  I crushed the seeds with a hammer and put the powdery substance in a cup of orange juice.  After I got off work, (about 5 hours later) it was time to test my concoction.    I drank the oj and then put the chunky stuff in my mouth and held it there for a few minutes and then swallowed.  The following is a description of my experience:    -30 minutes:  took a dramamine    0 minutes:  drank the stuff    30 minutes:  I felt a little weird while sitting at the computer.  Im thinking its just the placebo effect or just the dramamine.    45 minutes:  I drive to the store to get some cigarettes.  I had quit smoking but I considered this night special.  Still feel weird, kinda like a mild mary jane buzz.    1 hour:  I drive to a nice spot to listen to some techno.  I sounds nice, better than usual, although i feel a little sick.  Not really sick on my stomach but just like laying down.    1 hour 30 minutes:  Come back home.  Im starting to feel good.  I get some food because I\'m starving.    2 hours:  That food was awesome, like food when you have the munchies.  Improved taste sensation.  My whole body feels good, like I was on MDMA, although i have never tried the stuff, but I have a feeling this is how it feels.  Im tingling all over and I love sitting on this leather couch.    2 hours 30 minutes:  I cant stop smiling and giggling.  Seinfield is halarious although I dont really remember what it was about.  I feel fantastic.  My dad shows me a black widow spider that he caught when it was in our poolhouse (these things are highly poisonous) and I cant stop laughing trying to say \'man thats scary.  I\'m so happy bc i feel like I really scored with this HBWR.    3 hours:  I smoke a cigarette and can hardly stand up.  I cant finish it and a feeling of dread comes over me, thinking that i shouldnt have taken this stuff.  I lay down for a minute and it passes.  When I open my eyes Im starting to notice weird shapes and some very mild hallucinations with eyes closed and opened.    4 hours:  After a walk outside with my dog, I start to have a revelation.  I feel like Im in control of everything.  I realize that I am in fact control of my life and I need to do something about it.  I think about all the people I love and all the good times, and realize that I am happy and I like myself.  I had been mildly depressed before this experience due to relationship problems.  I\'m wishing that my best friend could be here with me, but i couldnt wait two more days to try this stuff!    5 hours:  I get some chocolate chip mint ice cream and it is absolutely delicious.  I starting to think that this stuff is wearing off, but this was only partially true.  I finish my ice cream while some dark side of the moon is on the headphones.  I look down at the remnants of my ice cream in the bowl, and the little chocolate pieces are moving around and expanding and then shrinking.  Its like the coolest thing Ive ever looked at and i continue to stare for another what seems 30 minutes.    6 hours:  I try to sleep but am overcome by auditory and visual hallucinations.  they\'re mild and not very distinct, but i can control them if i try.  Its hard to sleep because I cant seem to get comfortable in my bed.  I finally go to sleep about an hour later and I wake up refreshed the next morning and I feel happy.    Overall, I\'d say this stuff kicks ass.  I dont know if I just got some good seeds.  I had no nausea or bad side effects.  I kind of gained a new outlook on life and I guess thats what the hawaiians originally used it for.  I definitely wouldnt do this every night but Im definitely doing it tomorrow night with some friends this time.  This stuff is incredible!"
7995,Fantastically Wonderful,Spider Salley,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"This past weekend 2 friends and I decided to take HB Woodrose seeds.  I was the only one who had taken them once before, as well as the only one who had had any psychadelic experience (I have done mushrooms before).  Fortunatly my friends trusted my knowledge and previous experiences enough to try the seeds with me.  During our experience we were in an ideal setting - my friend\'s rental house in Tahoe. In all there were 4 of us, the 3 who were going to do the seeds, and a mutual friend who prefered to drink lightly instead.  The 3 of us took the seeds around 6:30 on Saturday night.  Instead of trying the elaborate extraction method, we simply scrapped the seeds clean of their outer casing, put them in a glass of water, and microwaved them for 3 minutes.  Although this softened the seeds enough so that we could chew them, I would recommend trying 3:30 next time.      After we chewed the seeds and chased them with M&Ms we sat down to watch LA Confidential, which none of us had seen before.  I warned them that we wouldn\'t come close to finishing the movie - it would be far too demanding to pay attention to once the seeds started hitting.  After about 30-45 minutes my friends and I noticed some nausea setting in, as well as increased sweating on our hands and feet.  Then I began to notice the waves.  My friends did not notice as much as I because they didn\'t know what to anticipate.  After another 15-20 minutes we all knew that something was coming.  We all smiled and laughed at the prospect.  I went into the bathroom and checked out my eyes - they were pretty dialated.  I couldn\'t remember how many visuals to expect so I asked my friends to come outside to watch the sunset.  We shut of the movie and sat down on the deck.  It was about this time that the visuals began to slowly set in.  I remember looking at the sky and watching it become 3-dimensional.  It would curve towards me, then away, in a figure-8 like motion.  Soon my friends began seeing similar effects.  As the sun began to fade, as well as the beautiful pink-colored clouds, we retreated into the living room.  At this point we were still in the in-and-out phase, so we were coherent enough to start a fire in the fireplace.  As the fire began to blaze we turned on Pink Floyd\'s Dark Side of the Moon. We turned down the lights and light several candles.  We found comfortable places to sit and tuned into the music.  I remember my thoughts racing, and my body beginning to feel the euphoria.    My friends had mostly gotten past the nausea as well, which eased my thoughts because 1 of them has a light stomach.  As time progressed we occasionally talked about what we were feeling, and what we could see.  I certainly wanted to talk the most, but I had to remember that this was a completly new experience for my friends.  We put on Paul Oakenfold\'s Tranceport album and about this time is when everyone peaked.  I continue to be amazed on how important music is for the experience -- it just takes you to another world.  I wouldn\'t say that I was completly at peace at this point, as I often am on E, but I certainly felt pleasant.  I checked on my other friend who was reading a book in the other room, and let me fellow trippers embark where ever their minds would take them.  I spent a lot of time with my non-tripping friend, which was cool because he\'s very mellow and intrigued about the whole experience.  I think sometime in the future he may be ready, but not yet.      It is hard to recall everything that happened the rest of the night, but I had amazing open and closed-eye visuals.  I remember sitting and staring at the bathroom rug, which was multi-colored and heavily textured.  It looked as if the rug was made of intertwining cork screws, each flowing over each other in a wave-like fashion.  I continued to feel wonderful inside, and I knew my friends were feeling the same.      The following morning we all felt quite good, besides the expected mental fatigue.  My friends reiterated how wonderful their experience was, and thanked me for getting them to try it.  Hopefully we\'ll have another opportunity in the future ...    Notes - On the web you will find other reports that discuss difficult, even frightening experiences with the seeds.  In my experience, if you are with good friends who you are comfortable with, and you are in a comfortable environment, you are bound to have a good experience.  I cannot stress the importance of this.  I highly recommend against taking any heavy drug if you are going to be around people you do not like ...  Also, my friends and I are all close to 6\'0 and 175 pounds.  If you are less than this I would recommend lowering the dose to 5 or 6 seeds."
11785,The Drug That Freed Me From Drugs,FormrTrippr,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I had been a pot head for years, and over the past year I had become obessed with \'ethnobotany.\'    Anyway, I got some HBWR seeds, and was very excited to try them. I throuroughly washed and scraped three seeds obtained from a reputable supplier, and ate them, not really expecting much. The result: THE FIRST TRIP WHERE I ACTUALLY LEARNED SOMETHING.    The trip began about 1/2 hour after eating the seeds. It felt much like taking a small dose of LSD with a difference. Instead of the   usual sketchiness and scattered thoughts that accompany an LSD trip, my thoughts were crystal clear. I became more rational than I had ever been in my life, and began examining issues that were concerning me: School, Work, my relationship with my girlfriend, and my extremely heavy marijuana habit (I routinely smoked two - three joints a day).    And suddenly, something just clicked in my brain. Even though I was having an amazing and fun trip, I realized that drugs had taken me as far as they could, and that it\'s now up to me to make the life I want for myself. And this life I envisioned did not include regular drug use, OF ANY SORT, including marijuana. It was not that I decided that drugs were bad, or evil, or even hazardous to my health anymore; I simply lost all interest in them.    The next morning, I woke up, feeling lethargic and hazy, just like the day after an acid trip. Purely out of habit, I took a few pulls from a joint, and it was completely unenjoyable. It did nothing useful for me. And that\'s when the memories from my trip came back to me. I put out the joint, and sold my entire stash of weed to a stoner guy in my dorm.    And since then, I have not done (or desired) marijuana or any other mind-altering substances, including these seeds (although they were extremely enjoyable and mild on the body). I realize that my obsession with cannabis and the hallucinogens was a desire to learn who I was, to \'get the message.\'    And that night, I got it."
17093,Awakening,Awakened,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I had the most intense experience imaginable.  I was very ill for most of the experience.  However, it seemed like a cleansing, a purging of all toxic beliefs, as well as of guilt and shame.  In this experience I met with the mother.  She told me the truth of myself and of her ownself.  The essence of tantra and yoga were revealed.    I now understand the mystery of the trinity (I am trying to figure out how to put it all into words).  It is in the meeting place of the inward and outward breath that bliss lies.  My life will go on as it always has but I will never be the same.  I found that joy and sorrow are the same.  There is no need now to take a substance like this again.  There can only be one awakening like I experienced.  I know it wasn\'t the substance the caused this but my own desire.  That desire is fulfilled.  Now I must try find a way to live in balance between the opposites apparent in this life and try to give to others what I can of the gift that was given to me.  This experience was both horribly frightening and intensely blissful.    I would recommend that anyone who uses a substance like this do it with respect and reverence and not as entertainment.  I have done LSD, mushrooms, peyote, as well as other psychedelics with intense experiences with each.  I also have practiced meditation for a awhile.  None of this compares really, to revelatory nature of what I just experienced with baby woodrose seeds.  However, as I said earlier, I will never do this kind thing again.  It has no further value now for me."
9534,How Can a Plant Seed Do Such a Thing?!,Frank-E-D,"Aug 25, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I have experimented with hallucinogens and other such substances many times in my life, this experience with HBW seeds was by far the most mentally intense experience of my life. A 13 hour voyage into the deepest and most unimaginable thoughts in my mind.    I ordered the seeds off of an internet site and they were said to be \'potent\'. After reading about suggested doses and what to expect from these HBW seeds, I decided to take 8 seeds ground up and soaked in water. I took more that was suggested, but I wanted to experience the full effect of LSA without any side effects. I was careless and got what I deserved.     An hour into the trip I got that acid onset feeling in my stomach, that soon turned into nausea, but I was sitting most of the time in the beginning so it wasn\'t unbearable. I was experiencing very rapid eye movements, lights and colors were more defined, some \'breathing\' was seen on flat surfaces. As I approached the third hour of my trip, the intensity was still increasing at a steady pace, I knew I was in for a night of pure insanity, and that wasn\'t far off.    Somewhere between the 4th and 5th hour, I got locked into an ever expanding loop of unrealistic thoughts, aspirations, inspirations, etc. Paranoia to its fullest extent. I didnt know what to expect and because the trip kept getting more and more intense I didnt think it would end, and if it did, I knew I\'d be changed. Time slowed down so much, half hour cartoons fealt like an eternity, to this day I still cannot figure out how or when one show ended and the other began. At one point I looked at the alarm clock and it was five minutes earlier than when I had last looked at it.    The thought of that night, to this day, gives me the chills and sends me into a dazed state of confused thoughts. Would I do it again? Yes, but a lot less, the initial effects were desirable."
16767,LSA Brownies!,sparr0whawk,"Aug 15, 2002",Argyreia nervosa seeds (Hawaiian Baby Woodrose),"This is by far the most intense trip I have ever experienced.  Though I must say, I am fairly new to using drugs as a spiritual guidance and development.  It hasn\'t even been a year since i first smoked cannabis, and of course I hadn\'t try anything else before then.  Since then I have tried morning glory seeds a few times and baby woodrose seeds a few times also.     The first time I tried the woodrose seeds, it was a spritual awakening for me, I had never even felt spiritual things before then.  I was driven by thoughts alone.  As I have been reading all of the morning glory experiences and woodrose experiences I kept wondering to myself: there must be another way to ingest them. Or at least, I wanted to experiment in areas I had not read about and could not find any information about.  I have not read of any experiences with seeds involving cooking experiments, so I decided to make some brownies with the seeds.      Ok, this is very simple.    I merely put the seeds (25) in a coffee grinder and spun it up until they became a mix of fine powder and a few chunks.    I put this mix into water before I added it to the brownie mix, just to make sure it got extracted a bit. It was actually only a few minutes before  I added it to the brownie mix.    Choose a brownie mix from your local grocery store and add the (1/4 cup or so of seed mix)     That\'s it! Bake some brownies... and you\'re good to go.     As I write this I am currently still tripping.  So, this is the first time i have tried this.     I must say, it is the hardest I have ever tripped, and with the least side effects of nausea and such. I have never had full blown hallucigenic effects until this day (and I have also tried a few grams of mushrooms before, but for some reason I never experienced true hallucinations)     Ok, as far as the amount, I ate about half the brownie mix... I really wanted to trip, as I never truly have before.  So I figured half the mix (roughly half the seeds, or maybe more depending on how evenly it was spread throughout).     I was sitting in front of my computer, waiting... waiting.. an hour or so had passed. I was starting to feel a little something if I concentrated.  Then about two hours after I ate the brownies, I was listening to the usual selections (some final fantasy, absolutely beautiful, peaceful music) and I was entering another world.  I stared at my hands and tried to become completely still, a practice in stillness to harness the energies within me.  My hands begin to blur together and it was as if I truly did leave my body.  I am not too experienced, so I\'m not really completely sure what an OOBE is like.  But this sure felt like one.  I was one with the music, and my environment.    I had many, many visions.. geometry mostly. But they were all completely amazing.. every time I closed my eyes.. I was taken to a new world.. and when I opened my eyes.. the world before me was ever morphing to whatever I chose.     Eventually I was getting restless.. and all these visions caused me to become rather nauseated.. I decided to take a shower.. and it was a wonderful cleansing.. I sat down in the shower realizing that the water would come strongest closer to the ground for the first time.. (the water pressure is horrible, it basically drips out).. all my shame and pride.. spinning into the drain.. near the end of the shower.. I was really feeling my stomach getting ready to launch itself.  At first, I had fear but then I calmed myself and prepared myself with three big heaves it was over.      After sitting there for quite sometime, I finally got up and took pictures.. and all of a sudden I had more energy then I had ever known in my entire life.. I am normally a very, VERY mellow.. laid back person.. and I rarely talk much.. so I lazily go about my physical tasks from day to day.. but then I decided to brush my teeth.    This is a very interesting note, my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have.  It\'s like I wasn\'t thinking about it.. I just let my body furiously brush my teeth.. nothing like I would normally do... because I thought about it so much.. I never used my body like it was meant to be used... my muscles were stronger than they had ever been... I also think it might be something to do with the lsa covering my teeth.. that combined with the toothpaste might have had some kind of chemical reaction.. but I also brushed very hard.. there used to be plaque... but there is no longer..     Ok, I really should wrap this up..   This has been the most amazing spiritual, physical, mental, emotional trip I have experienced.. I did take a bit too much.. but I don\'t regret it.     Take what you can from my words.. as I am now a part of you.   Farewell!     ~sparr0whawk"
16788,Double Dose Leads to Emergency Room,Major Bliss,"Aug 13, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"Double dose of what normally produces a pretty positive experience proves to end up an EXTREMELY NEGATIVE experience.  The psychological uneasiness and anxiety was so intense that I felt the need to call 911.  When I did I said, \'I really don\'t want to waste an ambulance but I feel very bad.  The 911 operator decided to forward me to the poison control center, but when there was nothing but an automated voice there, he went ahead and sent an ambulance.  When the ambulance arrived I told the paramedics that I was experiencing extreme anxiety that I couldn\'t control, and that I felt I needed observation through the night.  (The LSA-Ethanol was taken at night.) I remained on my side in the ambulance, as any other position seemed to make me feel worse.  It was the same when I was being checked in to the emergency room by a lady who wanted me to sit on a chair while I answered her questions, but I remained on my side on the floor by her.    Before I called 911 I tried to get myself to throw up but couldn\'t.  When I asked the paramedics if I should try to make myself throw up, they advised against it, and all the doctors I saw at the hospital advised the same.  Given the time I told them I ingested the stuff, they figured the psychoactive substance was no longer in my stomach and therefore vomiting wouldn\'t help.  Once on a bed in an observation room I continued to stay on my side, which seemed to reduce the suffering slightly.    The doctors were in no hurry to make my suffering stop.  Apparently they wanted me to learn a good lesson via the suffering.  Also, evidently all the blood-pressure and pulse readings they took showed me at a fairly normal level, so they didn\'t see the need to administer something to me immediately.  Regardless of my physical readings, I was in hell, mentally and physically.    Felt like I was dying.  Somehow a bad thought took root in me, and expanded to the point that it enveloped my entire mental and physical being, like a single fungal spore growing to the point of a lethal reaction.  Since the doctors were in no hurry to help me, I felt compelled to go against their advice and try to force myself to throw up in front of them.  They told me it wouldn\'t help because the stuff was no longer in my stomach, but I said maybe it could psychosomatically help me vomit up the bad thought.  I stuck my finger in my throat and made some hideous noises as I tried to force the vomiting, and the doctors jumped back, possibly wondering if I would vomit up some ghoul, some living demon that was in my stomach.    Nothing came up.  I told them if learning my lesson was the issue, that Ive learned it and that I would post this experience on the internet so people would know what is possible when taking this stuff.  Finally one of the doctors said he would give me something to settle my stomach.  They took so much time to administer that to me, or so it seemed to me in my torment, that I again tried to force myself to throw up, sticking my finger farther down my throat than I ever have in my life, and making some noises Ive never heard myself make.  This time I got some junk to come out and I did feel a bit better, so I did it again, and got more to come up, again feeling a bit better.  The violent act of vomiting does help expel bad thoughts.  One doctor said that one reason they advise against sticking your finger in your throat is that you can harm your throat, and as far as I was sticking my finger down my throat, I could see what he meant.  My throat was sore from it for quite a while.    Shortly after the vomiting, I was injected in the ass with atavan, which helped me mellow out.  Their policy is not to completely knock you out so that you suffer some to learn a lesson.  After a few hours they thought I was stable enough to go home.    I said \'Are you sure you aren\'t sending me home too soon?\' as I was still feeling kind of shaky altogether, and I felt comfortable in that hospital bed, but they felt I was well enough, so they called me a cab, I got in it, remained on my side, still feeling a bit dizzy as the cabby made his twists and turns.  When I got home I slept it off.    At the worse points of the suffering I prayed to any true God to alleviate my suffering.  One message I got was to help myself as much as I could, to utilize the \'God within\' as much as I could, and then whatever \'God without\' would help, so I tried to use my will to think as positively as I could.  That\'s largely what this whole ordeal was about, a negative thought budding to the point of a panic attack.  One feels that one can give oneself a heart attack simply by allowing the wrong thought to take hold.  One can get so sensitive on a psychoactive substance, which one can actually worry about being worried, causing a vicious circle.    I\'m thankful for ambulances, hospitals and doctors, and last but far from least, the almighty finger and the vomit reflex!"
8131,Amazing Trip,NH Shaman,"Jul 18, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"My parents had gone to our beach house for the weekend.  Knowing that my empty house would be the most comfortable place to trip, I called my friend and we both decided to trip on mushrooms that night.      Well, obtaining the mushrooms proved more difficult that previously thought.  My contact had a surprise visit from his marine recruiter, and ended up spending the whole day at a seminar for the marines.  He finally arrived home at 8:00.  By this time it was too late to travel to the city to get the shrooms.      Not wanting the golden opportunity to go to waste, I remembered the bag of HBWS I had in a drawer.  I am an experienced tripper, having done MJ, mushrooms and DXM many times, and smoking salvia 10x a bunch.  I had only done HBWS once before and found the effects to compare to a mild body trip.  But the dosage was fairly low and the preparation was sloppy.  I vowed to myself that the next time I would do more research and be more precise.      I accepted the fact that the holy mushroom was not going to be my companion for the night, and began preparing the seeds.  I was going to do a cold-water extraction. I started around 5:00.  I took 30 of the seeds (which had been purchased over the internet) and removed all the fuzzy, white coating. The white stuff is supposedly the main cause of nausea.      After doing this I took all the seeds and placed them in a plastic bag. Then I took the bag out to the garage, (making sure not to let my sister see, she was still home at the time) and placed them on the ground.  It is important to use a solid base.  I ground the seeds up by smashing them with a hammer.  After they were of a powdery form I put the seeds in a 24 fl. oz sport bottle.  Then I shook up the Cold water and the seeds, and placed them in the fridge.      3 hours later, my sister had left and my friend was at my house. The clear water had now turned a greenish-brown.  I knew this was a good sign.  Then I proceeded to take 3 Yohimbe Extract Pills, and a Vitamin C.  I took the Pills because I usually take Yohimbe with substances because it it a mild MAOI and is also somewhat stimulating.  My friend did the same.  We emptied the sports bottle into two cups and drank the concoction, seeds and all. The taste resembled bark, and we left the larger seed chunks in the cup.      8:35  About five minutes after drinking the seeds both our legs began to feel \'floaty\'.  Very much like on mushrooms.  Though it wasn\'t as intense.  We also both began to feel mildly drunk.  This passed though.  After sitting around for a bit we decided to go for a ride.  My friend drove.  We were listening to Rusted Root\'s CD \'When I Woke\'.  We went to a local movie theater.  When we arrived I began to feel this strange complacency, like I was supposed to stay in the car and explore this situation.  By this time I was feeling slight nausea, even though I had taken two dramamine. Listening to the CD was incredible, the music began to flow through us and it came through like an amazing journey.      9:00  As we were sitting in the car I began to rub my legs.  Wherever I touched my leg, my leg began to get incredibly warm.  Rubbing was intense and pleasurable. Not in a sexual way but in a relaxing way.      9:15  We then left the vehicle and went inside.  While inside all the noise was grouped and it seemed like a million voices were all carrying on conversations at once.  After five minutes we realized that the car was where we were intended to be.  And while I was standing the nausea was very intense.  So we went back in the car and picked up where we left off.    9:30  Then we drove to my house and sat in my driveway.  For the rest of the trip the setting is in my living room.  Lights are off. Music on this substance is definitely enhanced. Suddenly I had an urge to lie on the floor.  So we went in my house and played the CD in my living room in surround sound.  The intensity was unbelievable.  There were no visuals but the most amazing thing happened.  My friend and I both connected on a totally different emotional plane.  I felt so connected to not only him but the world in general. The thought processes were incredible, they were clear and vibrant.  Fully believing that I was controlling the universe.    10:30  Then I took out some fruit and the taste was unbelievable.  I felt as if I was consuming my own life force because I had come from the earth, and was a part of the earth.  The fruit tasted so real.  Taste was really enhanced.    By this time I had lost total control of time, what had been 3 hours felt like 8.  At around 11:00 my girlfriend called and that shot me back to reality.  My friend and I began disecting what had happened.  We came to so many spiritual revelations.      At 11:30 I called her back and felt a serious melancholy set in when I could not reach her.  When I finally did I felt a major warmth surge through my entire body.  My friend and I then had our girlfriends come over.  My friend left and my GF stayed over.  Sex was not on my mind.  Not only because I was still nauseous but because just being close to her was more than enough.  Though at its peak I believe this would be a sex enhancer.  At around 12:30 I was experiencing mostly after effects.  I had a great sleep and woke up refreshed.    I strongly urge anyone who has experience with pychedelics to try this.  It is not a visual trip, like acid or shrooms.  But it is just as worth it, maybe more so. Definitely start with a very low dosage.  No more than 10. After the strength is determined then you can up it.  The right setting will allow you to go on an incredible journey that may change your life.  It is not a recreational drug. You control the trip. You Decide how far you go. This is why it is so amazing. I eagerly anticipate my next LSA adventure."
14923,Unbelievable Panic,Zobroy,"Jul 8, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I received about 8 HBRW seeds from a friend who couldn\'t give enough accolades about his and other friends experiences.  I have used all kinds of substances for over 20 years and I have always taken caution when taking anything the first time.  To be more specific I have used Cocaine, Crack, LSD, Mushrooms, Marijuana, Heroin, PCP, MDMA, just to name some mainstream drugs.  I was excited to try something that my friend highly recommended and was cheap and legal at the same time.    Before I used the seeds I spent several hours researching the effects and possible things to be concerned about.  I decided to start with three seeds and to be frank all I was worried about was the possibility of nausea.      I took three seeds, scraped of the fuzz, ground them up and chased them with orange juice on an empty stomach.  I started to notice a buzz within 20 minutes.      T + 1:00 Nice mellow buzz like a mild MDMA experience.    T + 1:30 Head buzz intensifying rapidly.  Starting to feel a little sleepy.  I Drink some Ice Tea.    T + 2:00 Buzz like strong LSD intensifying.  Strong visuals. Melting objects etc.  At this point I was thrilled.  No Nausea.    T + 2:30 I eat another seed.    T + 3:00 Start to feel a little panic.  Very strange since I have a very solid career, health, love life, money, anything I want for the most part.  I can\'t understand why I am panicking.    T + 4:00 till T + 12:00 Eight hours of terror.  My heart was beating so hard that I almost went to the emergency room but being the veteran that I am... I rode it out.    I have had a few semi bad experiences with drugs including a couple of times where I may have come very close to an OD but this was light-years beyond anything I have ever experienced.  I believe that my bad experience was most likely just me.  But I wanted to share this in case anyone has any reservations.  It can be bad."
6758,No-One Dies,PsillyBoy,"Mar 24, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"There is no need for blind faith when you can experience that in which you believe.    We were to pay the Head a visit; before departing: two of us consumed a brew, carefully prepared a few days earlier:    I had taken 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and crushed them, leaving them to soak in boiled water before straining the liquid through an old t-shirt  Separating the none soluble, stomach-irritating fats, from the water-soluble psychoactive amide  being LSA, the naturally occurring precursor to LSD. Shared the tea with one other person.    I have some experience with the seeds and was expecting to peak in about three hours, to reach a mellow plateau from which I could soak in the surroundings.    An effigy of Buddha meditated on the brew as it brewed.    After a beautiful five mile cycle along the beach, we reach Hengistbury Head. We rise to the top as the sun sets deeper, casting fantastic reds & oranges into our atmosphere.     The third member of our group ingests roughly 80mg of MDMA.  In a place like the Head you could experience euphoria without ever adding extra chemicals to the swirling pool already you. We decide not to without ever making the decision\x85    One moment rolls on, before our eyes the intense beauty of day morphs to a beauty more subtle.    In the moment.    We lie a top the Head, a mellow plateau, sitting one hundred and eighteen feet above sea level\x85  Upside down, near the edge and all I can see is Sea,  And Sky!  And the curve of the Earth!!    In the moment.    The sky darkens, the wind chills\x85  We cover ourselves in a blanket plenty big enough for three.    In the moment.    The curtains are drawn back and we are allowed to gaze upon the greatest show on Earth,  The Universe\x85  We look out from a point.  We travel.    In the moment.    Three highs become one, then many.    I lose myself in the stars, the longer I gaze upon them  the more I see.  The only times I slip back from ecstasy are the times I tell myself:    \x91Its happening  Response:  \x91I dont need to know thanks, Im already there.    Sitting here, writing this   I am confronted by a memory in a different category to those recalling \x91everyday experience. A memory less focused on what happened, more on what I felt. A memory that is crystal clear but open to suggestion, a living memory that I know still has the power to teach me\x85  I felt what happened,  It felt a bit like this\x85    LOVE    Im unreasonably happy.  Im filled with the most intense Love I have ever felt.  Mad, directionless Love that flows out of me as it flows in:  It blows through me as the wind blows over\x85  And I have a feeling that, like the wind, its movement is circular.    As I lose consciousness of my body, I too become Love\x85  And I move with it.    Having experienced such Love, and all it inspires. I cannot doubt that God exists,  For I have known God in his purest manifestation, God as Love:   And so I realise that God is Love, the very same force   That which inspires creation.  That which creates creation!    The Human experience of LoveGod, known to lie behind the words of the term \x91Mystical experience, is both old & new, eternal & transient:  It is a fountain that human beings have been swimming in and drinking of as long as we have been apart  And we have always been a part\x85  LoveGod:    The illicit truth of every Religion.  A muse that inspires the whole Human race.  The source of all existence    As simultaneously spiritual and material beings, not only is our Consciousness born from it, Our Body as well.    My hand is inexorably linked to thoughts of my hand.   He is an expression of my consciousness, of its will to reach out\x85  To Touch.    One cannot exist without the Other because: One and the Other are One and the same.     LoveGod is a paradox, being every word we utter and the gaps in between    Explained equally inadequately by \x91Good & Evil, \x91Negative & Positive,  Simultaneously both and neither   It is being in the same moment as becoming, it never began and it still hasnt ended\x85    And so we find \x91The Human Condition:    I grow within  And on this strange world:  An impossible tapestry,  They try to unfurl.    Without knowing what to ask,  They question each thread:  Does it start when Im born?  Does it end when Im dead?    I grow within  And on this strange land:  An impossible tapestry,  Woven of its own hand.    Dont search for the answer,  For the answer will come.  Stand back far enough:  Two merge into One.    And so we find the Human race:    In our relentless search for the \x91answer (which is so ridiculously simple no-one stands a chance of comprehending it) we have neglected the beauty of all that provokes question.    And so we find ourselves\x85    There is nothing as perfect for now as the ecstasy of the infinite question:  The eternal involvement of self with other; finding out without asking a thing.  A passive exchange of energies, of information\x85     If we concentrate on pursuing the answer, as opposed to cultivating a passive acceptance of the fact that the answer is immanent, we do ourselves no favours\x85    First: We miss out on the ecstasy of the infinite question, in other words   We do not gain full enjoyment from our involvement with the outside and the inside worlds;  This involvement is to be marvelled at, celebrated, cherished and explored\x85    Second: As we dream of \x91the most sacred thing, we neglect the fact that everything is sacred.  This, combined with an unawareness of the inter-connectedness of all things, has contributed to the widespread destruction of our Mother Earth, Gaia:    She is our Garden yet we trample her plants and slaughter her animals, we suffocate her skin with a layer of concrete, pollute the air she breathes and the water she drinks with our foul concoctions\x85    She is our Garden, the tree is our life  and we still forbid our children free run of her fruits\x85    How I yearn for free run of her fruits\x85    The Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I consumed belong to a family of Gaias fruits termed \x91Entheogen meaning \x91God Within:    Many Entheogens having been helping Human beings find LoveGod since we first looked outside of meat for food. They are gifts   First from God,  Then from Our Planet.    There is nothing less human about looking to nature for \x91Mind food than there is about looking to nature for \x91Body food   Yet the former lies well behind in the acceptance stakes  At least in so far as many Societies, with their Governments and Religions, are concerned.    *  *  *  *  *    The \x91drugs had worn off.    We emerged from the woods, into which we had retreated after our Mystical experience a top the cliff, and lay once more under the blanket.  The sound of the Sea, its partner the wind thankfully absent, soothed us to sleep.    I awoke cold & damp but energised & joyous.  Climbing back up the Head in order to reach the warming rays of the morning Sun, I was sent two messages  arriving as thoughts\x85    The first, from God, said:    \x91No-one dies.    The second, from Our Planet, said:    \x91Its not too late.      copyright. Sam Ross. 2001."
6517,"Overall, Disappointed",Geoff,"Feb 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Two of my friends and I received 13 seeds each off of an internet site, in a package that promised an interesting, dreamy trip.  I hadn\'t had much experience with other hallucenogens (though I had taken mushrooms for my fourth time two days prior), so I had no idea what to expect.    We each ground 6 seeds up, then put them in our respective cups, spitting on them to pull the LSA from them (we\'d read saliva will remove it from the seed particles).  Then we poured a small amount of boiling water into each cup and allowed it to sit for approximately 10 minutes.  At this time, the water immediately took on a yellow color, and smelled like an herbal tea.    T-20min - We each took 2 Dramamine pills in order to combat the sickness so many people describe in taking Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.    T+0 - We began drinking the mixture.  It had a pleasant taste to it, except for the seed particles themselves, which were bitter and gummy.  By this time, I was feeling the dramamine pretty well.  I felt as though I had smoked marijuana, but was still able to think somewhat clearly.    T+20min - I finished the mixture, and took another Dramamine, because I wasn\'t interested in puking (I had puked only twice in my life that I can remember and wasn\'t going for a third).    T+45min - We all were starting to feel drowsy and incapable of moving without difficulty.  One of my friends, C., hadn\'t taken an extra dramamine, and the other, B., had.  C. said that he didn\'t feel sleepy, but both B. and myself seemed to.  Leaning against walls and lying on the floor sound good to everyone, and we all end up sitting in the hallway.    T+55min - C. vomits once.  He says it helped him feel better and gave him more energy afterward.    T+1:20 - B. is sitting in front of the toilet in the bathroom.  We decide to go for a walk and he comes with us.  Immediately as he goes outside he pukes up everything he has in him.  Meanwhile, I\'m feeling more drowsy and finding it difficult to think, though I don\'t feel at all nauseous.    T+2hrs - We return from the walk.  I\'m still not feeling any noticeable effects except for the extreme lethargy that supposedly accompanies HBW.  Both C. and I take Vitamin C in hopes of increasing the chance of seeing visuals (even though it may be too late).  By this time, we were thinking we may not end up tripping.  My pupils are still massively dialated, however, with almost no color left in them.  My pupils are large to begin with, so this is how they usually look when I trip.    T+2:10 - I decide to smoke some marijuana with a roommate in hopes of making the trip kick in.  It doesn\'t seem to have an effect, but I feel somewhat comfortable with my state afterwards, as being stoned is much more familiar.  Both B. and C. abstain from smoking with us.    T+3hrs - B. reports that he is able to see in double and occasionally move the location of objects by will.  After a suggestion from C., I look in the mirror while in near darkness, and notice that the light seems to brighten and darken randomly, while my face distorts itself somewhat and I see for passing moments it might become that of a beast.  Nothing extraordinary happens, however.    T+3:20 - My arms and legs start to feel cold and somewhat numb.  By this time, B. is passed out on the couch.  C. decides that he will return home, perhaps returning later if he feels any effects.  After reading more literature on HBW, I decide to take a short nap to see if I awaken to intense visuals.    T+4 - I wake up and see a few brief patterns under the covers.  Other than that, I can only feel the intense lassitude and drowsiness as I step out of bed.  I go to the bathroom for what seems like the tenth time that night, and return to bed, this time for good.    T+7 - I break from my sleep, but still feel nothing.  I return to bed.    In the morning, after sleeping 13 hours, I was still tired.  Overall I was disappointed by the experience, and after talking with B. and C. in the morning, got the impression that they were, too, as they hadn\'t experienced anything after going to sleep.  We may take them again in a few weeks, with the following modifications:    1. Splitting up one person\'s dosage and having two people take 10 or 11 seeds each.  2. Soaking the seeds for 2-3 hours instead of making a tea.  3. Taking only one or two dramamine instead of 3 to reduce the tired feeling.  4. Taking vitamin C immediately after we\'re done ingesting the seeds.    I think our biggest problem was too small a dosage and too little time allowed to extract the LSA from the seeds.  We didn\'t hold the drink in our mouths too long, either.  Most likely what happened is we took all of the poison in our bodies, and very little of the LSA.  For those who are thinking of taking HBW for the first time, I would suggest reading up on preparation methods extensively, as they can really make a difference."
9810,Tapping on the Windows of the Infinite,Drayke,"Feb 25, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"Joe (Elf also known to some by Elfstar) had purchased these interesting seeds from an herbal supplier.  He had showed them to me and told me what they were.  We both werent sure exactly what they would do.    When nightfall approached we smashed around 35-50 seeds on a board with a hammer and we were slightly regretful of not scrapping the outer seed coat on the seeds.  Joe and me were not exactly sure what they would do.  I guess you could say the element of surprise is a very, very wonderful thing.    We loaded up all the seeds and threw them into a water bottled were they were infused with water.  Joe and me started taking drinks of this strange hallucinogenic brew, and we had no idea what was going to happen other than the fact that we were going to trip.  As I slowly but gradually took sips I felt it was 100% horrible.  I could feel chunks sliding down my throat.  Just the feeling-not the taste made me incredibly nauseous.  After the first gag I was ready to blow.  Joe took down around a 1/4 to 1/3 of the mixture and said he could drink no more.  It was hard to drink it, but something inside me said drink more.  At last I finished the bottle.  Two minutes had passed.  \'Joe Im going to puke\' I said, and I did just that.    Joe said the toilet was kind of like an altar.  In a way all of your toxins physical and spiritual release.  I couldn\'t take gagging anymore, so I stuck my finger down my throat.  It took three times to really get something, but I let all of it out.  As I was vomiting I felt as if I was pushing out all of my negative energy with it.  All my pain, all my sorrow, all my hate, and all my inner demons gone.  I just let go of everything, even reality.    I opened my eyes in the toilet and the acids I had vomited up were so strong my eyes began to burn.  Just thinking about it today makes them water.  In a way it was like my eyes were being cleansed.  I kept my eyes closed and I began to look up towards the ceiling and something just took over...    I saw a tunnel.  It looked like clouds almost and it was layered.  It started out in a magnificent purplish blue and worked its way to red orange yellow, and finally at the center a bright, bright light.  I looked at that light and became one with it.  My whole energy field (aura) just change.  It was like becoming one with nature, chaos, and creation.  I felt like I touched what souls were made out of.  Feelings of pure bliss ran through my body and soul.  My mind felt cleansed and whole.  Everything was clear.  Every question I had ever had was answered.  Game reality was lost to my eyes, and dream was seen ever so clear.  There were no complications, thing were viewed ever so simple and clear.  Nothing was confusing.  I opened my eyes and began to observe.  I looked at the ceiling and saw the same tunnel.    Joe and me headed back to his room.  The room was lit by candle.  Hallucinations and visions seem to be more dominant in a room dim rather than full of bright light.     I described to Joe what I saw, and told him to let go of all his pain and everything else to.  We both looked at the ceiling and saw the same thing-the tunnel.  In a way on a spiritual level I feel we became one.  In the sense that that we could look into each others eyes and know what we were thinking.  We both understood what it was and we both became one with that light.  We both shared the same experience.  It was the most beautiful and purest thing I had ever seen.  It was like our conscious thoughts were stripped and all that was left was our true states of mind.     I was very observant on this plane (or high).  I watched Joes Celtic rug on the wall as the Celtic ribbons lifted off three-dimensionally and started slowly spinning then going back into place.  The walls changed different colors such as purple and blue when I was up close to them almost in the dark.    I\'ve never shared such a profound spiritual and mystical experience in my entire life with anyone like that.  The feeling I felt on that plane I felt for three days.  A feeling of true content.  I will cherish it in my mind and heart always as I cherish my friendship with Joe.    Joe died sadly in a car wreck off of Hwy 217 in between Tijeras and Edgewood New Mexico a few years ago.  They said he fell asleep at the wheel.  What can I say?  I miss the guy.  If he were here today Id thank him for making such an impact on my life and those around me.  He once told me \'If I die don\'t mourn, celebrate my life, and celebrate yours too.  I did just that.    Thanks Joe..."
6389,Close to the Edge of Insanity,Brain Candle,"Feb 21, 2002",H. B. Woodrose Seeds,"I just returned from a 10-day trip to Europe for school.  While in Austria, I found a head shop on a street corner.  I went inside and asked what they had.  The guy said all they had was Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.  So, I decided to buy 3 bags for 300 austrian schillings.  Each bag contained 10 seeds.     Later that day, I took 6 before dinner.  About 30 mins into the meal, I became dizzy and nauseated.  I went to my room to lay down and relax.  I eventually felt better and noticed some effects close to those of LSD.  I started to feel warm and tingly and happy.  I went back up to the dining room and finished my dinner.  My girlfriend and our other friends decided that we would play poker as we did the night before.  I am pretty good at poker, but that night I was awful.  I couldn\'t think straight. I was anxiously waiting for visuals.    After about an hour and a half, it became hard to see striaght and look at people in the eyes.  It felt like everyone knew i was on something.  I went to the bathroom to calm down and looked at myself in the mirror.  My eyes were blood-red and my pupils were the size of quarters.  I was feeling good, but i was also nervous at the same time.  After I sat down, I decided to quit playing.  I closed my eyes and started seeing fractals and rainbow like visuals.  I would close my eyes and see myself going down a long spinning rainbow colored tunnel. Everyone\'s faces were molding into wierd grotesque shapes.  People\'s glasses had one lense which was bigger than the other. Doorways were small then big.  It was nuts.    It eventually got to the point that I couldnt be around people anymore.(this was about 3 hours after i took the seeds)  I got an elevator and before the doors shut, two chaperones jumped in.  They said \'man its hard to get an elevator here\'.  I felt cornered and like they knew.  I said \'geez, I dont feel good at all.  I took some dramamine and I have a headache and my eyes dont look normal.\'  They told me to get some rest.  I got off on my floor and into my room.  I was so scared that they knew.  I told my two room mates about how I didnt feel well and how I thought that the chaperones thought I was drunk.  They laughed and said for me not to worry.  I got into bed and one of the chaperonesknocked on the door to do a room-check.  He said if I need anything for them to come get him.  I was overwhelmed with joy that I had nothing to worry about.    I closed my eyes and fell back into that same tunnel.  After they turned out the lights, I opened my eyes and watched TV.  It was crazy. The people on the TV were going 200 times faster than they really were.  I was seeing trails like crazy.  Everything looked fake and like everything had a colorful sheet of clear tinfoil on it.  My head was filling with anxiety.  I couldnt perceive myself as I normally did.  I didnt know if I was breathing or not. I had to relax my mind to make sure I was breathing. I had to think happy thoughts so i wouldnt go insane. I was to the point of screaming \'take me to a hospital!!!!!\' but I didnt. I couldnt let it take me.  It was a drug in my body. It was MY body, not the seeds\' body.      I eventually calmed down and realized I was in europe and I was tripping balls. I became happy. I thought about my girlfriend and how I feel about her.  I had a sudden feeling of relaxation and euphoria.  I had a smile on my face and I was seeing rainbow colored plus signs on everything.  I was feeling good, but I also needed some sleep.  I couldnt fall asleep. I felt feverish and thirsty as hell. I went to the bathroom to piss and drink some water. I looked in the mirror and everything was out of proportion.  My body\'s movements were all trails that looked like rainbows.  I went back to bed and fell asleep.    The next day we had a 3-hour walking tour in the freezing austrian rain.  This was the worst hangover ever. I was freezing and nauseated. Later that day I ate a piece of cake and had some oil-like coffee.  I warmed up and felt really good.    My advice to anyone who wants to take these seeds is to do it when you are in a comfortable place, preferably where not a lot of people are.  Also make sure that the day after you get a superfluous amount of sleep.  That was the most intense drug I have ever taken.  The first time I tripped on LSD I took 2 black gel tabs-it can\'t compare to those 6 seeds I took."
7493,A Temporary Loss of Self,Lo,"Feb 15, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"This is the only kind of \'psychoactive substance\' I\'ve ever taken, outside of alcohol and marijuana eaten or smoked occasionally.  I hadn\'t eaten for around 6 hours, so I thought it would be a good time to take some HBW seeds.  I\'d tried the night before taking two, which brought about a general \'large-dose of caffeine\' feeling, although this probably isn\'t a good description.  After carving off the outer brown portion of each seed, I chewed up and swallowed with water the white substance of approx. 4.5 seeds.  I wasn\'t taking any medications at the time, except some occasional 5-HTP.    About an hour and a half afterwards, I started feeling a strange \'overfilled air balloon\' feeling in the brainstem region, not very pleasant, and a slight nausea. I was at first unmovable and lethargic, and at once had this feeling like the regular \'me\' wasn\'t there, that now, occupying my body was a non-entity, or a tree or something. I didn\'t want to address questions addressed to the \'me\' that wasn\'t there. Emotions were flat, and everything and everyone seemed exactly \'as is\' (almost as if normal hallicinatory experiences of everyday life are taken away). I also felt a compassion for \'humanity\', since I didn\'t feel like a human. I also noticed, going for a walk outside, that after a couple hours, anything unfamilliar became frightening, and I needed a familliar setting in order to feel ok.    A couple hours after this, sensations were extremely heightened, and simply lying in bed was wonderful; sheets and beddings were exquisitely comfortable, like I\'d never before felt comfortable, *this* was comfort, as I resumed a strange legs-over head position (as my limbs felt virtually weightless). Touch from outer sources were felt throughout the whole body, and were almost as if coming from pleasure centers in the mind directly instead of through the skin.    Overall, the intensity of the experience was almost too much to handle, but I\'m glad I went through with it. I can definitely say it was good to have my boyfriend there with me, or the experience may have been *a lot* more negative. It can either be horrible or wonderful. It also made me think about things in a way I haven\'t thought of for that long of period - it is disturbing to loose a sense of oneself, but potentially enlightening as well."
11048,I\'m a Convert with Some Gas & Burping,Jonathan,"Feb 14, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I got 25 HBWR seeds, I then used a pair of pliers to crush the seeds.  I did not remove anything from the outside of the seeds, they were used as is.  I then put the crushed seeds in a jar with about 2 cups of water.  I let the mixture sit for 36 hours, shaking occaisonally.  The water turned a nasty brownish color, but didn\'t smell of much.    At about 1:30 pm, \'B\' and I drank an equal part of the liquid and ate the remains of the seeds (leaving about a 3rd of the seed mush).  This was done on an empty stomach.  It was very mild tasting, somewhat like an oatmeal taste or something.  We then sat back smoked a joint or two and waited.      +2 hours- we both noticed slight sensation...somewhat lazy, groggy....nothing very strong.    +3 hours- noticable feeling of happiness, silly grin on face.  \'trippy\' sensation...tightness of jaw, jittery stomach.  Very similiar to the feeling I get on LSD.  Although no visuals whatsoever.      +5 hours- giddy, giggly and feeling different.  Nothing strong at all, but a noticable effect.  Could have been active during the experience, but was quite happy to be chilling at home listening to music and hanging out.    No nasuea or pain...some gas, burping.      Overall, we both agreed that it was quite pleasant, felt like half of a hit of a drug somewhere between LSD and MDMA...I wonder what 20 seeds would feel like?  Anyway, I was skeptical about these things, but I am a convert now, and will look into other natural legal drugs of this type...look in other vaults in the future, to see how I like em.    Overall grade, C+ (would have been higher but my expectations were too high)"
5897,A \'Television\' In My Mind,Virgin Psychonaut,"Feb 5, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"First off let me say this was my first experience with any form of psychedelic. I had no clue what to expect, other than what I had heard from a friend of mine.    Preparation:  I took a nail file and shaved off the outer coating of the seeds until it was light brown and somewhat shiny. For the last 3 seeds I decided to pulverize them hoping they\'d take effect sooner.    At 6:20 P.M. I took my first two seeds. It was hard to chew them with braces. They\'re rock hard.    At 7:00 I took another seed. I was only planning to do three seeds for my first time.    Fifteen minutes later I began to feel a little floaty, but it went away. I was bored as hell and was getting somewhat impatient. I killed about a half-hour playing Quake on my computer. I was approaching the hour and a half mark and felt nothing. Frustrated, I prepared another seed, pulverizing it this time, and ate it.    Waited a little. Still nothing. I prepared two more seeds, but didn\'t eat them yet. I found a good movie on TV. At 9:20 I still felt nothing. I thought I had a weak batch. My friend was feeling stuff with one seed. I\'d had four. So I took the last two.    Slowly the effects came on. Extremely subtle. I just laid down and stared at the TV for an hour. I think I blinked once or twice that whole time.    Nature called. By this time everyone in my house was asleep. Total silence. This was about when I first witnessed visual distortions of any kind. The bathroom is an extremely small, and monotonously lit. On the wall that I was facing there is a small painting of a plant of some kind. I stood there and stared at it for a while, then I noticed that parts of the frame was starting to disappear into the surrounding whiteness.    I spent the next two hours in my room listening to electronic music and creating strange patterns out of little spheres which appeared just above the carpet. This kept me busy for a few hours. At around 2:00a.m. I decided I should get some sleep. I had read that most people found it easy to fall asleep on LSA. However I was still peaking.    I think the first mistake I made was to turn the music off.    The mental effects of LSA were like turning on a \x91television in my mind, constantly feeding me with totally random thoughts and images. With music playing I didnt pay much attention to the television. When my environment was totally silent I wasforced to watch this television. I couldnt turn it off, and trying only made it worse. Especially while peaking. For the next two hours I was convinced that I was going insane.    After an hour I could tell that the effects were diminishing, but my mind was still racing with random thoughts. Ever 30 minutes or so I got out of bed and walked around the house in an attempt to re-orient myself. I still felt I was completely alone. I had no concept of the outside world.    At around 4:00a.m. I managed to fall asleep. I woke up at 7:30a.m. and it felt like last night was all a dream and that everything was going to be okay. I decided to go watch some more TV.    A half hour later I began to feel like I was still trapped in a dream. I had no recollection of the other day before the trip, and I had trouble convincing myself that I was back to reality. Everything seemed different. It wasnt until about 11:30 in the morning that I suddenly felt normal again. The intense fear I felt the other night seemed almost enjoyable.    That afternoon I began to feel slightly nauseous but I never vomited.     I am debating whether or not to take the seeds again. If I do I will most definitely not take them at night or alone. I will also have some soothing music ready if I do start feeling anxiety. I found that classical music works best. The trip was not as visual as I had expected, though that wasnt necessarily a bad thing. I had to concentrate to make things happen, and it took practice but I got better at it."
5119,HBWR Disaster,KCM19,"Jan 11, 2002",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Several days ago, I ate 9 HBWR seeds I obtained from an online catalog. They tasted pretty foul, but I chewed each one thoroughly before swallowing. That was at 12:30 PM.    I expected nausea, and that\'s what I got. Starting about 30 minutes after I ate them my stomach felt terrible and I got very very tired. I lay on my couch with some friends, none of whom were tripping, just trying to ride out the nausea and waiting for some more positive effects. I felt like I wanted to sleep, but when I tried to, the discomfort from the nausea was too great, so I just lay there for quite some time.    Around 5:00 PM, I got up and walked about a block to a benefit dinner I had purchased a ticket for. I knew I didn\'t want to eat anything, but I figured I might as well make an appearance.    Waiting in line to get into the dinner, my nausea started getting more and more acute. By the time I realized I had better find a bathroom to vomit in, my vision blacked out and the next thing I remember is opening my eyes and looking up and people crowded around me. I got up, very disoriented and frightened, and sat down on a couch nearby. The drug had really kicked in at this point, and hitting my head as hard as I did on the ground didn\'t really help a whole lot. People were talking about calling paramedics, and someone did call college security, who arrived within minutes and talked to me. I was tripping hard enough to make talking to pseudo-law enforcement a really trying experience. I had to convince them that I was fine, that this sort of thing had happened before, that I just needed to go back to my dorm and drink some water, etc. They wanted me to go to the hospital but I was afraid of legal repercussions etc. I know HBWR isn\'t illegal, but at this point and in my condition it seemed like anything could happen and that I would be headed to jail if I didn\'t get out of there fast.    Anyway, I did manage to convince them I was all right, something I myself wasn\'t that sure of. I got back to my bedroom and spent the next 12 hours in an awful, spinning, paranoid hell, hearing (hallucinating) the police come into the room, the ambulances waiting outside, my friends telling the police it was acid, etc.    Basically it was the most miserable day I can remember by far. So if you decide to experiment with these seeds, remember that unless you have done them before you don\'t know what their effect is going to be on your body. Above all, don\'t put yourself into a dangerous situation like I did. I could easily have hit my head on something sharp when I fainted, rather than just on a carpeted floor. Be careful everyone. These plants can be a lot of fun but you can mess yourself up pretty bad without even realizing what\'s going on.    I sound like an old man, I know, but I\'m 18 and I just hope that no one else will have as bad an experience as I did. Read the info on the net and take the whole thing seriously."
4625,Hollywood on Woodrose,Kai,"Dec 29, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I was layed over at one of the many youth hostels in LA for two days right after Christmas. The only other american there was a pothead, as well as a dealer, so we became fast friends. After we spent the afternoon smoking pot, we got on the subject of hallucinogens. I talked about wanting to trip, but having no money and being in a strange city, I had no where to go. He told me he had a bag of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds in his room, and would be happy to share them with me for smoking him up. I asked him the details about the seeds, having only heard of them in passing. He told me every detail I could squeeze out of him; what would happen, had he ever done them, things like that. He finally gained my trust and ran back to his room to grab the seeds. We spent the next hour trying to scrape the \'skin\' off of them. He said he had taken them with the skin on, and had no side effects, but a friend took them skin on, and threw up a bunch of times and had a bad trip that lasted eight hours. We tried to get the skins off to no avail. So I decided to just maw on them plain, all 14 of them. I hadn\'t eaten all day, so the taste alone made me pretty sick.     About half an hour after eating them, I felt all kinds of shitty, and decided it was time to throw up. I went to my room to puke, and did, but there were no remenants of the seeds. Just water and stomach acid mostly. I went back to the common area where my new friend was waiting, and let him know I didn\'t feel much better, and if I went to the hospital, if he could take my (cashless) wallet so they wouldn\'t fish out my ID and make me pay any bills (damn non-socialized medicine!).  I decided to lie down, and began to feel like I was really going to die. I kept feeling worse and worse, but didn\'t express my alarm to anyone on the offchance that if I hold out, I might just feel better.     An eternity of 30 minutes passed, and all of a sudden I realized I wasn\'t dying, just tripping balls. The discomfort I felt was just my stomach, but when I stopped paying attention to it, I felt REALLY REALLY good. It was like really clean acid, save for the feeling of gut rot, but I felt so good I decided to explore Hollywood for the first time. I walked up to Mann\'s Chineese theatre and placed my hand in Harrison Ford\'s print. I explored the walk of fame, seeing if I could figure out which blank star my name would someday be written upon (I run a cult of personality in my spare time). I got hassled by the Scientology Building security guard, who seemed a little put-off by my trippy non-logic when trying to explain why I was franticly scribbling notes in my notebook in front of his scary cult building. It was a good night, I saw plenty of neat sites, and had I eaten, I prolly wouldn\'t have had all the stomach problems. If it hadn\'t been for the tummy ache and the near overdose, I\'d give it a 10. But I\'m giving this trip a 7, because I hate LA."
3771,From Good to Terrible,HBWR lsa,"Dec 25, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I had just ordered 10 grams of Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds off the net.  I couldn\'t wait to get them and try them. I had done other drugs MJ,pain killers, etc.    5:35 pm - I ate the seeds on a pretty empty stomach (didnt eat much all day.) and got on the computer to screw around while I waited.    6:30 pm - I noticed a little bit of a high coming on and a heavy feeling in my stomach.    7:00 pm - I was extremely high, like I had just smoked many joints of marijuana.  I was very happy that it worked and things were going great, sounds were awesome, lights, just all out good.    7:30 - 8:00 pm - I was totaly fucked up, I could hardly walk or talk and my toughts were racing.  I was getting alot of closed eye halucinations and alot of distortion in things.  But it was good and I was very very happy giggly mood.    Then about 15 minutes later something happened.  I wanted to watch this stupid drama show on tv.  I didn\'t even think about how it could make me trip bad, that just did not enter my mind.    Well I started watching it and sure enough I started feeling sick so I went to my room and threw up like crazy.  I cant even explain what was happening my mind was racing I was seeing colors lights hearing old songs my muscles were extremely weak.  I did everything I knew to come out of a bad trip but it was not working, nothing was.  So I just layed there praying that it would end I would feel normal again. ALL IN ALL it was the worste freaking time I\'ve ever had on any drug and it goes to show how quickly things can turn bad.  This stuff sucked.  I\'m going to stick to Marijuana or beer."
3637,Body More Sensitive,Japanfreak,"Dec 25, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I live in Japan where it is very hard and expensive to find good drugs. Recently I decided to give legal drugs a try and ordered some hawaiian woodrose from the net. Now before I did this I read through these posts and people had all different types of experiences. Some people raved about the seeds and some people seem to think they are a hoax. <!--Well they are definitely not a hoax. It might have to do with the seeds you get, but the ones I got from http://www.peruvian-journey.com were potent, cheap, and arrived within a week of ordering. (No I have no connection to them)-->    Preparation    I removed the coating off 10 seeds. This is very easy to do. I managed to get them clean with a spoon, I didn\'t even need a knife. I then grounded them up in a mini cuisinart. I then put the seeds in a bottle of mineral water and let them soak for 4 hours. I was concerned about the vomit effect everybody seems to have, so I then filtered the green water through a coffee filter to make sure there was no seed material in the water.    Effects    15 min after drinking - My mouth started to get a tingling sensation    25 min - The trance music was really sounding good    40 min - I started to get a huge energy boost. I was ready for the clubs. My eyes were fully dilated    50 min - I stopped at a bar on the way to the club, but they were playing country music (yes even in Japan). I had too much energy to sit down anyway. This was also the first time I noticed that my sense of time was screwed up. i was in the bar for about 20 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours.     2 hours  I got to the club and was about to go in when I got a phone call from a girl I know. She said she wanted to try it also, and since I had prepared two portions for such an event I went to her apartment.    3 hours  She had drunk done her bottle and about 30 minutes had past. We were staring at a toy I bought at toys r us that lights up and moves around. We were getting nice trails off of it. It was just really pretty.    4 hours  I noticed that my body was feeling more sensitive, especially the bottoms of my feet. I think an hour before this I couldn\'t have sex if I wanted to, but now I could, so I did. I don\'t know if this was because of the seeds or not, but the sex was harder then usual and I couldn\'t cum. Once again time was messed up because we thought we were at it for 4 hours, but it had only been an hour and a half.    5 1/2 hours  I went home and on my way home I noticed how pretty all the lights looked. My night vision was great. I drive a motorcycle so I had a great time looking around and feeling the night.    6 hours  When I finally decided to lay down and go to sleep I was in for a surprise. I kept thinking that it wasn\'t anything like LSD, but I was too pumped up for it to notice. As soon as I closed my eyes and relaxed I was tripping big time. My limbs and body were shrinking and enlongating and doing all kinds of funky things.  Finally I fell asleep at 6 in the morning, 9 hours after drinking the seeds."
3532,Mellow But Crude,Phil,"Dec 24, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"A couple of days ago I had a pretty satifactory Hawaiian Baby Woodrose experience. I\'d tried these things a few times, with good results, but an increasing amount of nausea and disgusting taste each time. This time I wanted to thoroughly minimise that bastard nausea, and try extraction rather than chewing/eating. My friend and I spent a whole afternoon preparing, to ensure a good experience. We met after a light lunch, and ground up 12 cleaned seeds each in a coffee grinder, placing the resulting powder into 2 bottles of cold water. The water almost immediately turned black, which we took to mean high potency. We shook the mixtures then left them a few hours. Half an hour before ingestion we took 3 sickness pills each and smoked a joint of hash, for nausea reduction purposes. Then we filtered out most of the muck with coffee filter paper, and drank casually.     Within a few minutes an uncomfortable feeling began, throughout the stomach and body, eventually reaching severe nausea. My friend kept it all down, but I couldn\'t. At the same time, things became intense, physical stimuli became intrusive. My friend had drank about 20mins before me and seemed to be getting passed it. I was still very nauseaus and uncomfortable, feeling like I\'d messed up. We were both burping quite alot. We went to a sit in a park and I tried to ride this bit out. I felt major anxiety, the makings of a bad trip. Sounds were intrusive, and my vision was blurry, like being drunk. My lips felt swolen and numb, sort of aneasthetised, maybe due to reduced circulation. We both had strange physical feelings like distortions/swellings in our limbs. The trip came on much faster than eating raw seeds. It was very downer-like, and sedating, which helped me calm down and begin to enjoy the trip (great relief). The setting became relaxing, with a nice cool breeze setting off pleasurable relaxing sensations in my body, just by listening to it up in the trees. This was odd, since part of me was still nervous and nauseated. It was like experiencing oposite feelings/emotions simultaneously.     My friends joined us and sat around sniffing amyl nitrate and having an animated conversation. This was a reasuring sight, although when we were actually spoken to it was a bit too puzzling and intimidating. I became quite giggly, and forgetful. My initial paranoia when I met them had gone too. I had cooled quite a bit and needed to borow a warm coat(also good for comforting). My friends were vital to be around, as something to focus on, and they helped us a lot. We were both experiencing very vivid feelings of being some place else whilst still watching our friends in the park. For example my friend felt as if he was on holiday in Germany, and I felt as if I was sitting in the garden of a friend\'s house. He could also see patterns appearing in things like the grass. Familiar people seemed caricature, people seemed smaller, and there was a general tone of grey over the world. My friend also noticed this. Linear time became hard to perceive, first time sped up considerably-the first two hours went by in about 30mins.     As we got to the peak it began slowing down and by the end it was crawling along. There was a feeling of being far from recent events and even \'isolated\' from normal life. Our minds were a bit volatile so we didn\'t have to concentrate on anything for too long. It was pleasant and carefree, and certainly helped prevent freakouts. An overall sense of positivity prevailed. We lay in the grass, and my friend felt he was drawn in by nature, there were definitely some kind of calm natural feelings. However there was also a strange \'dirty\' buzz feeling hanging over the trip, a kind of impure feeling. At times it was like a cannabis high but with a \'dirty\' psycedelic extension to it. I feel that this stopped me from really reaching a truly great high. Hallucinations were not prominant- no real visual/aural distortions (music wasnt impressive), a few smell distortions, and slippery touch (quite pleasant). We both got an effect where vision became pixelated with little colored squares, that form objects when the eyes are closed. Closed eye visuals were identical to those I had been having recently with marijuana -- the exact same recurring patterns. When I\'m on the seeds though I don\'t really pay attention to hallucinations, they just blend into the general feeling. As we came down intensity came in waves, during which reality was dream-like. We peaked very soon-the first 2 hours were a blur, and returning to baseline was very gradual. The trip probably lasted 7/8 hours. I somehow failed to record any of those meaningful conversations with my MD recorder which I had brought for the purpose, which is probly teaching me a lesson to not try and capture the thoughts you have when tripping.     Interestingly, we both experienced the same perceptions throughout most of the trip, eg. time, location, visuals etc, even without communicating, kinda like telepathy. It was a mental trip. Most of the perceptions I had this time are definitely characteristic of all my HBWR trips. Physically, lethargy was not a problem, but I had a constant stomach discomfort, slight nausea, and the taste kept coming back up. My friend however, didn\'t have this problem. I think there is some kind of pain reduction, since I\'ve had cuts etc. that I didn\'t feel during my trips. My lips have felt swollen each time too. Every time I took a hit of amyl it was like waking briefly from the trip and then going back. For once, food was excellent-better than on cannabis, perhaps because we hadn\'t eaten much, but definately enhanced.     There was a sense of success and satifaction. I\'d decided this was my last seed trip (if only because of the taste), and it was a great end. The sense of learning and understanding was there -- I felt like I\'d beaten paranoia and felt really confident. I watched a horror movie on TV, and it was more ominous and macabre than usual. It was a bit too involving and didn\'t want to spoil the good mood, so I decided to get some welcome sleep. Just woke once feeling a bit agitated. Awoke next day feeling fresh and positive. Definitely had to go through a lot of pain before the pleasure, though it was worth it. Overall, very mellow, though on a previous higher dose trip my emotions did overwhelm a bit. Most people won\'t end up using these regularly."
4337,Deep Sleep,hangoverish,"Dec 24, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"A few weeks ago, I had ordered 200 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds from a seed company.  They turned out to be old, though they still germinated.    I ate ten the first time, crushed in water. No effects. The next day I took 30. No effects. No nausea. No nothing. A week later I ate 75 in about ten minutes. Just chewed them up really well and swallowed, no other prep. Nothing again.     So I decided that I should get some from a different source.  I ordered some from an individual in Hawaii who had just harvested them himself. Fresh, guaranteed.    So yesterday I woke up at 6:30 feeling very well rested, and took 2 dramamine. Then at 7:00, I ate 7 seeds. Just like before, I chewed them up, coating and all, and swallowed.    I felt a little sick in the stomach by 8:00. Took a shower... had to sit down, I felt pretty sick when I stood up.    Around 9:15 or so, I felt even more sick to my stomach. Though I never really felt like I had to vomit. I sat on the couch with a blanket around me. Fell asleep in seconds. I had very vivid dreams for the next 5 or 6 hours. I would wake up every hour or so, but felt so groggy that I didn\'t even move, and just fell back asleep sitting up. The phone rang a few times, but I had no desire to answer it. I didn\'t even attempt to get up.     I really didn\'t have any kind of \'trip\' feeling at all.    I had to work at 3:45, so at 3:30 I got up, pissed, ate a sandwich, and went out to my car. I felt very dizzy, and had a bit of trouble judging distances. Luckily, it only takes me 2 minutes to drive to work. I would have walked, but it was December.    I felt like I had a severe hangover until about 7:30. Disoriented, dizzy, slightly blurry vision, a bit sick to my stomach.    I just scraped the fuzzy coating off of 10 seeds and crushed them. I\'m going to put them in a glass of water before bed and drink it first thing in the morning with a caffeine pill... maybe that will offset the sleepiness I experienced."
5140,HBWR works for me,DoYouKnow?,"Oct 31, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I have tried HBWR seeds before.  I can\'t recall from whom I made the purchase, but I think the seeds that I recieved were bunk.  I remember I ate a number of them (it was a while back) with a friend and waited for 2 hours, ate the rest of the supply with still no results for either myself or my companion.    But this is not the tale I intended to tell    I compulsively ordered some HBWR the other day from an online vendor. I chose to order the Tahitian variety, whether this matters is a question i can\'t answer.  I got over 30 seeds for $10, much better than what i paid for the bunk seeds, though my new seeds look the same as my old seeds did.  Before I begin, I must note that I have eaten acid on several (15+) occasions and mushrooms a few times, so I have a decent trip background on which to base my analysis.    I decided against trying to extract the desired alkaloids from the seeds, as my morning glory trials were never to successful and caused me to associate the taste of the final solution with the torments of the damned.  I simply chewed and swallowed 4 seeds one by one, chewing as best I could and swallowing with chocolate milk. prior to the ingestion of the seeds I had only drunk some juice and milk, my last meal having been the night before.  My seeds were swallowed at 9:30 am.  I should note that some of the seeds I got had a thick woody furry whitish (hooray for adjectives) layer on the outside, which I assumed was the furry white nausea layer described in various places on the net.  I ate 4 seeds that did not exhibit this layer, though they did have a very very thin whitish coating on them, which appeared to wash off with water, then returned once the seeds had dried.    Anyhow, the seeds were in my belly by 9:30.  By 9:50 I felt different, very slightly dizzy, and I thought I noticed very subtle visuals consisting of transparent color masses in my field of vision.  I also began to feel sick, it was a sickness that centered in my stomach.  I tried to wait for the sickness to go away, but ended up willing myself to vomit at around 10:15.  I threw up only once and now i think it wasn\'t that bad but i wasn\'t too happy at the time.  It did, however, seem to make me feel a little better, only I did still feel a bit sick, and now noticed that I was feeling hot and cold on and off.  I basically rode it all out and waited and felt the same, with levels of nausea varying.  At around 11:30 I decided it was time to use my all-purpose medicine, and smoked a very small amount of pot, barely enough to get high.  Strangely, it made me feel much better.  I looked up and out my window at the snow and realized that things seemed brighter than normal, which is when I realized that my trip was beginning.      I basically spent the whole time lying around. After this, but was completely content.  I found myself to be having a great time lying with my head on its side, looking across my bed, and generally enjoying detail in a different way than I normally do.  By 12:30 visuals were more intense.  Various intricacies were observed on surfaces like the bed spread or a sheet of lined paper, these visuals seemed to be straight out of a mild acid trip. Patterns and such were seen with open and closed eyes, always predominately green and purple in those shades which I have only observed in Acid trips and on the surface of soap bubbles.  I didn\'t move around a whole lot during the trip, and noticed I was uncomfortable when I did. at one point when standing up I began to feel dizzy and heard a buzzing sound vibrating through my skull.  This buzz also intensified my visuals, but all subsided once I sat down for a while.  Thought processes were definately enhanced, I found myself coming across numerous revelations which at this time still seem valid.  I found myself to be very good at manuvering words, and felt inclined to write some poetry, though I haven\'t ever written anything for fun before.  I found reading difficult though due to my attention span, because my thoughts were racing on in the background about what I had just read etc etc.  It is now 9:30 pm and I feel back to normal, with very subtle acid after-effects visuals noticed when I look for them.    Over all, this would be a great trip if it hadn\'t been for the nausea.  After the nausea went away everything was great though, it was just what I was looking for.  I think I may up my dose by 1 or 2 seeds next time, and try to take some nausea precautions like dramamine or fasting.  The trip reminded me of a weak acid trip, but with a different sort of mind trip, it somehow felt more spritual than dose i\'ve eaten, and I really do believe that I learned from the trip in the revelations that occured. I noticed that i kept looking at things really close for long periods of time, and that my trip was a bit more euphoric than straight acid, even after the weed wore off.  This is a good thing to try for respectful trippers, and i recomend(sp) a partner for those who have not tripped before."
6928,Being Alone,Sarah,"Sep 23, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,It started out my friends coming over around 10 PM and saying they had these seeds that made you trip.  I\'ve done acid many many times so I thought nothing of it.  They said ten would do me good so I was like okay and chewed them up.  We left and drove around for a while and nothing happened for about twenty minutes.  Then we went to this park near my hometown.  I started to feel really sick but no visuals or anything.  Everyone else seemed to be fine but usually my stomach is kinda sensitive to things so I figured that\'s what it was.    Around 11:30 we stopped at a gas station to get cigarettes and they saw these strange guys that I had no idea who they were.  They were like let\'s hang out and all this shit.  I didn\'t wanna go.  I felt so weird and distant to everyone.  All I could really feel was the sickness but with little visuals.  So I told them I wanted to go home.    At about 12:30 they took me home and dropped me off.  I had trouble walking up to my door.  A lot of trouble but I felt safe.  I was happy to be home.  So I got into my house and went into my dads room cause he worked nights all the time.  I was just relieved to be there.  I sat there and watched TV and realized I was tripping but I still felt sick. I tried to keep the sickness furthest from my mind but couldn\'t.  My mind raced through so many thoughts about life and death and if this was the worst it would get.   So I started to panic.  I lay on my couch and got really sick.  I couldn\'t even walk right to the bathroom so I crawled gagging and throwing up many times.      Finally made it to the bed again and it felt like I was going to swallow my tongue.  In order for me to swallow I had to drink something.  My mind raced through so many thoughts.  I had to think about everything in order to feel like i wasn\'t going crazy.  For the longest time all I wanted was for my brother to get there.  But when he did he went to turn on the light and I freaked out.  I said to get the fuck out and I didn\'t want him in there.  He was like are you tripping and I said yes but he didn\'t understand why I was just laying there.  I couldn\'t explain or look at him.  So he left and I lay there alone again.  I just wanted it to end.  I felt like I was gonna stay like this forever.  This lasted a total of 16 hours for me.    I don\'t ever ever want to do them again.  That is just a light way of putting what I went through.  Maybe it was because I was alone but if someone wants me to again there is no way in hell I will.  I don\'t want to feel like I\'m going to go crazy or die ever again.
7105,A Trip Too Terrible for Words... WARNING!!,illegal faerie,"May 29, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"my boyfriend and i, who have been tripping for years, and are very experienced with many different kinds of hallucinogens, have never been freaked out by a trip before, encoutered the worst night of our lives three nights ago.  i wanted to leave this as a warning for anyone who is looking for cheap legal trips like morning glories or hawaiin baby woodrose seeds to proceed with EXTREME caution.  from taking 12-14 seeds, soaked, peeled, ground up and swallowed (as we have done many times before and had pleasant, normal, acid-like trips)... we experienced the kind of trip you would imagine getting from eating a sheet or two of acid.      the first tripping sensation was that my eyes would not stay still.  it felt like coming out of a k-hole, or DXM, not a hallucinogenic feeling but a dissasociative effect... although the room was quickly becoming unrecognizable i could not focus on any visuale because my eyes were darting uncontrollably from side-to-side.  i then went into a strange trance- a computer access database that was arranging my subconscious into categories... the chronology of the trip is impossible to get straight but i can remember fragments of what was happening.  there was a  black hole sucking in fractals of light, i felt myself going into the black hole with the rainbows and then it sucked the rest of the room away and dropped me back on the bed.  i was in vivid childhood memories, in mid-memory it would turn me upside down and drop me into another memory.  some were normal and pleasant and others were frightening parts of my subconscious that i honestly cannot decipher even now whether or not they are true or false memories.  i thought i was a create-a-card machine for a long time and recall saying aloud \'its writing all over me\', its a hallucination that was recurrent over the night and even into the morning.  the last thing i remember before the peak is feeling like a 2-dimensional line that was part of a series of lines.  i cannot recall anything from the peak which lasted approximately four hours.  the only thing i can say is that i came out of it terrified and feeling the worst mentally and physically that i have ever felt in my life.  i was terrified.  it was the first time throughout the night that i realized the trip was going wrong.  i had tripped three times on the same dose of the same seeds and had wonderful and pleasant trips.  the peak i cannot recall or explain in any way that makes sense, i remember purple, and circles and the rest of that was not solid or coherent in any way.  it was so frightening,  i was crying.  i noticed that my boyfriend had gone into convulsions and i tried to ground him, all he said was \'im trying to come back\', he\'s not sure if he meant he was trying to come back from the peak or if he thought he was dying.  as i was coming down (still tripping harder than i ever have before) i noticed my heart was beating so fast i thought i was going to die.  i threw up thick red blood, and so did my boyfriend while still tripping.  for three hours we felt like our insides were being shredded up and that we were definitely going to die, i thought if i moved i would have a heart attack.   we went through self-blame and self-loathing and thought every bad thought it is possible to think- for 48 hours we could not move or eat.  it was been almost four days now and we still feel like some major damage could have been done.  If you decide to do this- please be careful.  if you are not experienced with tripping- DO NOT DO IT.  Do it inside under safe circumstances with people you trust and try to have some thorazine or compazine (it is kind of easy to get a prescription of compazine- its for nausea and i take it for migraines but i did not have any of it on me that night- and i was too fucked up to know i was tripping anyway until after the peak ended)... that can bring down the trip if it goes wrong.  I am certain that if we had taken a higher dose we would be dead.  Should you do it- start off with a low dose (7 or 8 seeds) and move up, never past 12 seeds!!  Overdose of this even under normal circumstance can result in hallucinations (not just visuals), convulsions, coma and death!  Use extreme caution."
1604,Woodrose Abroad,Angry Johnny,"May 22, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"My friends and I were bored one day and being that we are in Germany, we thought we would stop in and explore a German head shop.  The place was full of the usual products you would expect to see in a headshop, except that on the counter was a sign that said \'Hawaiian Woodrose.\'  A friend of mine asked what it was, and the guy gave us a brief description of it being like a mild trip on LSD.  We bought 10 seeds for 20 DM (about 10 bucks) and headed out on our way.      The next day we popped some seeds in at about 2 pm.  The guy at the head shop had instructed us to first scrape all of the yellow coating off of the seeds, if you did not do this you would get very sick and nauseated.  You were to then bite down on the seeds and just hold them there for awhile.  After a while, we started munching harder and harder on them and they started breaking up into tiny seed chunks in our mouth.  I have to tell you that this is the worst taste that I have ever encountered.  I did not want to eat alot of food, for fear of combatting the trip, but I did drink a Pepsi so as to mask the taste. It only half worked, the seeds are very potent tasting.      Within an hour I was tripping hard. No hallucinations or anything mind you, but just a stoned feeling.  I felt like I  was thinking a thousand words a minute, but when I tried to talk, I could not!!! I would conscienciously think, ok, talk. But I would not be able to! My friends and I watched a movie and then went outside and sat on a picnic table.  We sat there for what felt like two hours.  Probably so, now that I think about it.  Everything was just so entertaining and amusing.  I was just staring at the ground with this intense peace of mind like everything was gonna be alright.  We sat there giggling for awhile like little children.  After awhile, we went inside and made some home made nachos and relaxed cuz my girlfriend got a severe case of the munchies.  We all ate and the trip quickly started to subside. But this was after about four hours.      Later on, I thought the trip had ended, but my girlfriend and I had sex.  Sex was very intense and I realized it was still affecting me. I could have gone on forever I think.  Afterwards, I think the physical activity re-released the drug into my brain because I started to trip more.  I started thinking of memories that I had not had since I was a little boy.  Things that I used to think about as a child, and had slowly, with time, forgotten.  But these memories were all rushing back to me.  I felt a dire urge to call back home and just talk, to reminisce about things.  I don\'t know, it was very strange.  But once again I was very at ease with everything; family, my girlfriend, the future...      Anyways, the next day, I was not tripping, but I still felt really good and at ease with everything and I talked with my girlfriend about it and she realized I had changed for the better too.  I was more at ease with things that before had troubled me between her and I.  Even today, I think I have been slightly changed on the more positive side since then.  I have done seeds since, both times with three seeds and the taste gets worse every time. I don\'t think I can handle the taste anymore, the last time I almost puked and could not get rid of the taste for what seemed like a couple of days.  Also, the first time I had a mild burning sensation behind my knees under my leg, and with each subsequent trip, it gets worse and worse!!! I think I am done with them for awhile, but it was definitely an interesting and worthwhile experience!"
5430,6 hour sickness,xerxes</A,"Mar 4, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Here is my experience with HBWR.  I obtained a packet of seeds from an online botanical company, and proceeded to scrape them clean, and ingest them by chewing them the best I could, and washing them down with a cup of water.  The taste was a light, nutty flavor, and not specifically bad.      The first effect I noticed, was an increased \'brightness\' to everything.  Colors were enhanced, and I coulden\'t wipe the smile off my face.  I have no experimented with LSD or mushrooms, but the effects were similar to descriptions of those substances.  Mostly, the effects were mild.  Soon, however, I noticed my stomach was feeling quite upset indeed.  After about and hour, I became VERY ill.  I vomited about seven times over the next few hours.      The high took a turn for the worse.  Insted of a happy brightening of my surrondings, I was overcome by a terrible feeling of anxiety and urgency, like the feeling you get when your in deep trouble, or before a scary ride at the amusement park.  this lasted throughout the trip.  I felt hot and sweaty, with an itchy tingling feeling all over my body, and inside my throat and nasal cavity.  I slept for about 3 hours, and woke up several times to vomit.      Overall, I can only describe this experience as being poisoned.  Any high I had, or any interesting effects can be achieved better by drinking drano.  I will never take this substance again, I was in a state of misery for about 6 hours.  Please, if you must try this, use a LOW dose, this will lessen your pain later."
2979,First Time on HBWR Seeds,Marklar,"Oct 5, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I recently recieved 20 HBWR seeds from a friend. I was really looking forward to taking them but my parents were making it difficult. One sunday morning however, they left to go out for lunch at about 10:30. So I quickly got 10 seeds out ready to take. I wasn\'t sure if they would be back particularly soon so I was unsure as to whether or not to do a cold water extraction. I went onto IRC to ask how long I would have to leave the ground seeds to soak, someone said about 3 hours so I decided not to. I chewed up the seeds and swallowed with water. There were still some bits in my mouth so i brushed my teeth [which helped get rid of the strange taste that chewing the seeds left] and swallowed the froth. I went and sat down by the PC and chatted on IRC. After abut half an hour i started to feel mild nausea and a bit of dizziness. This got stronger until at T+1 hour i decided that being sick was a good idea. After being sick, all the nausea went almost instantly away. However, the dizziness persisted. I went back to the computer for about half an hour and felt really comfortable in my chair. I decided to pick out different tracks off music which i can normally do well on all sorts of drugs. It was particularly easy to do on today.     After this half an hour i got up to get the mail [my post box is at the bottom of my garden] and i took about 4/5 steps and almost fell over from the surprise twinges in my leg. It felt a little like lactic acid but more of a shooting pain the the ache of lactic acid. I decided to carry on down to the postbox and i got the mail and walked back up to the house. The walk turned into a crawl halfway up the path. I lay down to catch my breath [because it was really tiring for some reason] and the stone which had been warmed by the sun felt all nice and hot. I decided to lay there for a minute but when i got back to the house i found an hour had passed. The \'journey\' usually takes me about 2 minutes. I flopped about in front of the PC for about 3 hours until my parents came home. My dad tried to talk to me but i found everything he was saying really funny and was smirking at him. Thankfully, he thought i was just being annoying and left. The disturbed vision that i had since T+1 hour tailed off from about now to about 17:00 when i felt nothing except tired. That was T+ 6hours 30. I got a good nights sleep that day and felt fine the next day.    I couldnt be bothered to take the other 10 after the hassle i had with the last 10. I took them into school and gave the 10 to a friend: G. He split them with T. T had 6 and G had 3 because they dropped one. I only spoke to them at break times because neither were in any of my lessons that day but this is what was reported.  T+ 1hour 30:  G was a bit queasy but T was feeling ill.  T+ 3hours:  I here that T is feeling better but still a bit queasy. I meet with G who is very relaxed. He thanks me alot for the seeds. We walk to the tennis courts where G finds great amusement in jumping over the tennis nets in a funny manner.  T+ 7hours: I dont speak to T but i hear he is feeling better and had an okay time. G waits for the bus with me and is still relaxed and smiling.  By the way, i dont know the weights of everyone. But i suspect that G weighs about 9 stone and that T weighs about 11 stone. I weigh 10.5 stone."
137,I Took 30 Seeds and Nothing Happened!,The Ladies Man,"Oct 4, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"[Erowid Note: There is quite a bit of confusion around Hawaiian Baby Woodrose vs Hawaiian Woodrose seeds.  These are two different genus/species of plants, and it is HBWR which is most often consumed for its psychoactive effects.  The following report is somewhat unclear about which type of seeds were consumed.]    I purchased these hawaiian woodrose seeds from a website and I am beginning to wonder if I was ripped off. The seeds had no white coating, but were a solid light brown color (does this have something to do with potency?). I heard that you\'d never want to take any more than 10 seeds or you\'ll be sorry, so being the ballsy bastard that I am I ate 15. I chewed them down to nothing while swallowing the juices. I retreated to the comfortable confines of my bedroom, closed the door, got a pad and paper reading to record the experience, turned on the TV and put on a Wu-Tang CD and just waited for something to happen.     Hour 1 - Nothing.    Hour 2 - Not a damn thing. Not even any nausea.    Hour 3 - Gone through two Method Man CD\'s and a Redman CD and notta.     Hour 4 - Only thing I\'m feeling so far is hunger. (I hadn\'t eaten since that mourning) I\'m starting to get a little pissed.    Hour 5 - Not a god damn thing. I think those bastards at peruvian journey ripped me off. I\'ll send them a flamer they want soon forget... ( I was pissed, I really did write that down.)    Hour 7- Pissed and dissappointed so I smoked three blunts. Now I\'m really hungry. I think I\'ll get some japanese food from teriaky express...    Hour 8 - Well this concludes a very dissappointing first experience. I suppose I\'ll try again later but I want more info. But for now the night is over for this bad boy...    Now I\'m a pretty solid, muscular guy. I\'m only 6\'0\' but I weigh 190lbs plus tax. When I asked around on the internet, people were telling me that off of 15 seeds I should have been temperarly insane and puking my guts out. I took the ingestion tips from this site and crushed up 20 seeds this time and soaked them in water over night. I drank the green liquid first thing in the mourning and even swallowed the seed mush just to be sure. I didn\'t record anything this time because I was a little doubtful that anything would happen. And as it turns out, my doubts were justified. Once again for 7 hours nothing, not even any nausea.     On my third try I ground up 30 seeds this time and instead of soaking them, I boiled them. I boiled them in 2 cups of water and one cup of lemon juice for 20 minutes, then I turned down the heat and let it simmer for an hour. The liquid was a dark green and the seed mush was practically non existant. I cooled it in the refrigerator for 2 hours and then drank the bitter fluid. Once again nothing. No nausea,no dizziness, nothing.     What gives? Someone else that posted here said that taking HBWS was like playing russian rullet, 3 out of 4 people will have a trip. So what gives? Am I just really unlucky? Or am I doing something wrong? I only got a few seeds left and I want to make this time count. Somebody help me out here!"
540,An Unexpected Journey,Amy,"Sep 14, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I have never tripped before in my life.  I am a freshman in college, 19 years of age.  I have experimented with MDMA and other forms of Ecstasy, MJ, etc.  Nothing hard-core at all.  Went to visit Daniel and he suggested we try these seeds together (both first-timers).  We ate a huge dinner and took the seeds around 11:30 PM.  He had soaked the seeds in water for about three hours and we scraped the brown fuzz off with our fingernails.  We chewed them up and swallowed them.  Tasted like peanuts, not bad at all.  Felt the beginning effects about 15 min. later while walking in Wal-Mart. Found Dramamine and took it. The nausea was no big deal...felt a bit heavy in the bottom of my stomach, but other than that, no vomiting.      12:30 PM- Smacked-out roll feeling.  Generally happy.    1 AM- Went to a deserted beach (Sardis) and I laid on my back feeling as though I could not move while Daniel danced around free-spririted.  Cigarettes were absolutely amazing, admitting bright orange tracers...fascinating visuals that were extremely vivid.    1:45 AM- We walked in the enveloping darkness to the water\'s edge and felt as though we could walk across the water without any difficulty.  Looked to our left and and we both saw four dark figures walking towards us.  We were overcome with fright and extreme paranoia...stopped in our tracks feeling as though neither of us could move.  We were genuinely scared for about five minutes!  As we were walking along the sand, looking down at it, it appeared to be large canyons, such as that of the Grand Canyon in a way.  I felt as if I was sinking in the sand but could walk fine.  I viewed the below sand as shapes of the world, my footprints causing large pools and lakes in that vast miniature Earth.    2 AM- Began to see holograms around bright objects.  The moon had an aura around it that was beautiful.  We concentrated on car lights moving slow.  There was a distinct iris around the lights consisting of red, green, orange, and yellow.  I held a prism from the lights in my hand and was able to contort it in any way or shape.  It was as though the \'prism\' was physically solid and I could touch it and move it.  Quite amazing.    2:30 AM- Attempted to enter a Chevron back in town to buy some water and felt as though everyone was planning a conspiracy against us.  The cashier, I know, was hiding a shotgun under the counter and she looked at me as though she knew everything I had ever done in my life wrong.  She was the devil at that moment.  Intense.  Ventured to the guy\'s house who had given the seeds to Daniel and I.  Everyone there had eaten their fair share of the seeds.  Daniel and I sat transfixed on the floor watching a poster.  I could turn the poster into any color I wanted and move the figures in all different ways.  Holograms and tracers were still vivid at this point.  Street lights possessed a strange ring of neon blue around them that was absolutely beautiful.  I had never seen such vivid colors and shapes in my life.  Quite strange that Daniel and I were tripping the same visions, etc.  We felt the same always.    3 AM- Felt extremely exhausted for some unknown reason.  Felt the lethargy lurking behind my eyes.  Had a great over-all body buzz still going.  Felt numb in my eyes and especially behind my head towards my neck...almost as though everything \'buzzed.\'  We both decided to attempt to sleep.  Walked into a dark room that felt as though it was 1000 feet long.  I was walking into a strange tunnel that swirled around me.  We both layed down and closed our eyes.  I knew Daniel was fine and enjoying the experience.  He mentioned that everything was as a kaleidoscope of visions, shapes, and colors.  I closed my eyes to find that my head would not leave me alone.  I could not reason with any of the thoughts that entered every milisecond.  I was quickly driving myself into a non-reality that I could not get out of.    3:30 AM- Could not stand the insanity any longer!  My thoughts were racing and my mind was eating itself inside out.  I jumped out of bed and ran to the bathroom calling to Daniel.  I began to try and compose myself but failed miserably after I looked at the pattern on the bathroom wall.  The ceiling was rippling, as well as my whole body.  The pattern on the wall was contorting itself in swirls and mixtures of intense colors.  My head buzzed and I could feel hotness in my ears.  My hands were clammy.  I had to get out of there!    3:45 AM- Threw on my shoes and went out in the cold with nothing but my PJs with Daniel.  Walked around in circles trying to reason with my thoughts.  Smoked a lot and figured out that I was definitely in another dimension.  Not even what one would consider a third dimension...this had to be like the tenth dimension of a world that did not even exist.  I knew I was going insane, lost in a world of raw chaos.  I could not get comfortable and I had nothing to ground me.      4 AM- Daniel and I decided to drive to the next town and back just to get my mind distracted.  I knew he was going through the exact same intensity as I but he later told me that because he was so focused on keeping me from suicide, he remained calm.  I began to see extremely intense visuals and rapid hallucinations.  Splotches would remain within my area of vision for what seemed to be hours and visions were so rapid that I could not focus on just one.  They were ever-changing and constantly distorting.  I could not look at Daniel for more then two seconds because his face and hands would morph into something or someone unrecognizable.  At one point I saw the skin from my fingers melting away replaced by boiling blood.  I looked at Daniel and saw Jesus Christ with a halo.  Later, I realized I was \'peaking,\' lasting about one hour.  I kept sticking my feet out the window of the truck and rocking back and forth.  I thought about the padded walls I would soon be visiting as soon as he got me to the insane asylum.  That is where I needed to be.  And I remember thinking that I was NEVER going to come back from this insanity as I kept chanting over and over again,\'We have got to do something....we have got to stop this!\'  If there is a hell, that was it.  That was hell.  I tried everything.  I wanted to make it beneficial.  I thought about happy things.  I tried to do normal things in a mere attempt to bring myself back down to normality.  Nothing worked. I needed suicide I thought.    4:45 AM- An hour passed and I was recovering from my bout with intense chaotic insanity.  My head ached for rest and my eyes would not close though I was exhausted and drained of all energy.  Everything still seemed as a kaliedoscope and the ripples were still ever-present.  The whole trip was intense and Daniel and I had to wait until 8 AM until we could go to bed.      I would recommend drinking vast amounts of water to get the \'hell\' out your body quicker.  I slept until 5 PM the next day.  We both woke up to a feeling of being \'strung-out\' and just generally out of it for the rest of the day.  Hunger returned and eating helped the feeling.  I was fine but still felt the effects of distorted vision.  The back of my head was still buzzing.    Though I experienced what I thought was the most horrible thing in my life, I will never regret doing it.  I will probably do it again.  The experience definitely altered my state of thinking and opened doors to a world of philosophy unencountered.  My thoughts are more vast and mature.  The correlation between thought and word is now clarified.  Many writings will be produced as a result of my experience with HBWR.  I would NOT recommend HBWR to those weak in thought and shallow in mind.  It truly is a journey, a TRIP, to experience.  Be careful with it.  HBWR is not to be fucked with when taken correctly.    I have no basis for comparison but from my experience alone with HBWR, I KNOW it is GOOD.  I was pushed to the edge of sanity and brought back again as soon as I could not handle it.    I remember experiencing alienation, could not catch my breath, dehydration and intense thirst though I could not drink anything.  Music was great and nature was absoultey amazing.  Thoughts were intense as well as vision.  Depression and indifference has folI have never tripped before in my life.   If you enjoy insantiy, give HBWR a try.  I know that it will soon dissipate but I also know the my reality will never be the same again.  If you enjoy insanity, give HBWR a try!"
327,A First With the Mind Candy,Barney,"Sep 11, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I had been wanting to try HBW seeds for a long, long time and finally got the chance. I ordered 60 seeds for $20.00 over the internet.    Me and Dodd and Nam decided to try them out to see if they are as good as we\'ve heard.  Nam, an experienced dropper tried one as he had homework and other things to do that required a sober head. We decided to scrape the hairy coat off the seeds with Dodd\'s penknife.    This took bloody ages, so in the end we peeled two and opted to crush the rest in a coffee grinder and add water to the pulp (this way the seed matter is soaked into the water and the coating sinks to the bottom).  We shook the water and left the mixture soaking for forty-five minutes. While we were waiting Nam started to come up on the one seed and recognised lsd feelings, this is acid he said. We returned and drank half of the mixture each and ate one of the seeds each.    We felt no nausea at all and the mixture did not tase bad at all. We decided to go for a drive (Nam drove) and Dodd said he could feel it coming on (it was his first trip) He started to feel worried as if he was going to jump out of a plane or something. I began to get a little bit excited but nothing more.  After about half an hour, the trip came on.    Colours became intense and the music started to surround me. When I looked at my hands they were changing before my eyes. It affected Dodd more than me. He was laughing and saying this is amazing. Throughout our drive we could not stop laughing and were having the happiest time of our lives. Dodd came very close to hallucinating, but it wasnt to be. Colours were really bright and space seemed different (this was most noticable in Blockbuster video.    By the time we got home (about 2 hours later) we went into Nams sitting room and I noticed the walls were breathing and  space became really distorted. We watched Pink Floyd\'s The Wall and I felt more emotion and pitty than I have in a long while. After this I went back to my room feeling depressed for about forty-five minutes.  But then I thought about all the good in the world and how Pink Floyd cared about veterans and the trampled people and began to feel very happy and content. I went back to Nams for awhile and although the lsd feelings had almost subsided I felt at total peace...very, very mellow almost like I had smoked a bit of hash.    I slept like a baby that night and the next day in the place of a hangover, I had eight hours of intense happiness and well-being. At the end of the day I had a very minor visual, I saw little pieces of light like fireflies descending down on me.    Overall a very happy and trippy experience, which I would definitely recommend. The water mixture idea is no good though, we missed a good quantity of seed matter and probably ended up having more like four or five seeds each. This volume was a lot of fun. Certainly more fun than being drunk but for hallucinations more are probably needed.    p.s We experienced no nausea and even had a bite to eat while tripping, the seeds did not taste disgusting and neither did the water mix, we also had very fresh harvest seeds."
196,A First Approach with Not So Good Timing,Opul,"Sep 10, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"At 7:30pm that day I decided to give my HBW seeds a try. I did suck up a lot of info, as I usually do for months before approaching a new substance.  I decided to eat the seeds on an empty stomach, since I read a lot about the nausea and I really am not looking forward to getting sick on something that is supposed to bring me something pleasant. I decided to keep a sheet of paper and a pen close by, so I can take notes and retell everything, especially the time, which usually gets lost on those experiences.    Back to the report: 7:30pm 6 HBW seeds on an empty stomach, while my baguettes were in the microwave, I was hungry and figured I would be able to eat shortly after I consume the seeds. I\'d say about 5 mins after the ingestion my baguettes were ready, but by that time I was not feeling like eating anymore. I was still very hungry but a whole bunch of symptoms began to show....I was NOT expecting the (hammer crushed) seeds to work that fast!! I became VERY hot and felt VERY uncomfortable, VERY dizzy...it was just extreme. And I felt a belly ache, I figured it might be my pants or too tight shorts or something like that....usually not a problem because I have a nice flat belly. I also felt like my wrists are being cut off from circulation, so I pulled my sleeves up, didn\'t help though.    So I decided to take a bite, after all I was hungry and eating might help me feel better --- NOT. About 10 minutes after those 2 bites I was only able to take those 2 bites decided to come out again, I felt SOOO sick (well I was, doh). Funny thing is though, about 5 mins after vomiting I was sitting in front of my computer and was laughing again, because somehow it was cool. The unpleasant feelings had somewhat disappeared, I felt relieved and better. Only for a little while though.    We are at 8pm now, I have marked four words on my \'trip sheet\': dizzy, spinning, tired, disoriented.  I figured the fatigue might come from my workout that afternoon and it was the least thing I was worried about.     8:10pm: the physical fatigue became extreme, my forarms seemed more cut off than before and my hands almost numb, even so they were functioning alright. I also thought that maybe the lack of energy might have been caused by the lack of food.....I eat a lot all the time and drug experiences are always terrible because I\'m hungry but mostly not able to consume anything. But never experienced that fatigue before.  The phone rang twice, I was not able to answer it, felt way too uncomfortable for that.    Now here\'s quite a turning point in my story....this was not planned to be the normal living room experience, I had tickets for \'Sixth Sense\' and was going there at around 8:15pm (movie started at 8:30). I was close to cancelling, but I figured I have the tickets and the nausea might go by. If I would have had to drive I would have remained in my living room, but I didn\'t want to look for excuses, since I was getting picked up.  Didn\'t talk much on the way to the movies and was just hoping not to get sick again. My stomach decided otherwise at around 8:28 though and I puked big time again, but with no food intake that wasn\'t very good. I got a hold of myself though and went in there at 8;30 and actually felt fine now.  What were the effects? I had a change of perception, somewhat like on mushrooms, but without anything moving or changing shape. It just looked like you look through some twisted glass or so, but everything the same. Besides, the movie was excellent on HBW, I had to laugh quite a few times though when nobody else did and I was fascinated by my perception...I saw everything from a third eye perspective, like I was watching a movie on TV where I can see myself sitting in the theater. Awesome.    That was pretty much all that happened, I was lucky to find someone to drive me home right after the movie, since I was starving but not willing to go with the rest of them to some bar. I ate the cold baguettes at home (yuck) and fortunately did not get sick anymore. I sat at home and played some computer game on the internet with a friend and enjoyed the view.  The entire trip was VERY unemotional though, that somewhat disappointed me. I felt completely indifferent all the time. I\'ll definitely look into it again, but I HAVE to find something against that nausea...if that won\'t go away I won\'t touch the seeds again, because if I have to throw up something it can\'t be alright and that means I won\'t do it to my body."
1517,Cold Water Extraction vs Chewing Seeds,Nekom,"Sep 10, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"After extensive research, I decided to try the Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seeds.  I ordered 20 grams of seeds, which turned out to be a lot more seeds than I had thought.  Me and my friends B and S went fishing.  B scraped the fuzz from the seeds, which is reported to cause nausia and took 8 seeds.     We returned to B\'s house, where we picked up a case of beer which we intended to drink if the experiment fizzled.  We then went to S\'s house for the night, and me and S scraped 10 seeds each, ground them as best we could with forceps and a meat tenderizer, soaked them in cold water for about an hour and drank the water.    B had reported only uncomfortable feelings, but no major effects.  Within an hour, S and I began feeling quite tired and sick.  I laid with my head down for about 30 minutes, half asleep.  It was then that S decided to get his mom to take B home, and I walked to my house right up the road.    As soon as I stood up I began feeling very strange.  I walked home in a thunderstorm, very slowly, stopping in my yard to have a cigarette.  I went inside, said goodnight to my parents and went to my room.      I went to my computer and played mario for super nintendo on my emulator in slow motion, which was qutie entertaining.  I then watched david letterman, who had jackie chan on the show, and burst out laughing for no apparent reason.    After watching some TV I noticed that when the screen briefly went black, looking out the windows was strange.  I turned the TV off, leaving no lights on in the room, and watched the thunderstorm for an hour with a huge grin on my face.    I did not experience any visuals really, I would describe it as a euphoriant rather than a hallucinogen.  Overall, I would say it was very pleasant after the nausea wore off.  I called S the next day and he said he had the same kind of experience.  B only got sick.    From this I would recommend to anyone trying them for the first time to use a cold water extraction rather than chewing the seeds.  And don\'t expect an acid trip, it is NOT acid, but it is a very interesting journey."
644,Playing the Game of Life,Jack Harris,"Sep 10, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"So it was a cold, dark Friday night and I invited 3 friends to come over and experience some LSA with me. Me and 1 other friend, C, had tried HBWR before but with only 8 seeds and moderate results. This time C and me decided to double up doses and go for 16 each, whilst the other 2, B and D, went for just 10 each. I ground them up, mixed them with warm water, and left them 4 hours to soak. Meanwhile my friends and I just generally messed around in anticipation of the experience. What would it be like at such a high dosage?    So at 10:00 PM we downed them. Almost immediatly I went downstairs to the toilet, and found it really hard to go. I then went upstairs and everyone was laying around complaining that they felt like shit and were gonna hurl. I lay on my bed ready to puke. Then one of my friends, D, threw up out of the window many times and said he felt way better. I nearly did loads of times but managed to keep it down. D then wandered off to play on his mobile phone on his own but me, B and D had this weird conversation that went on for about 2 hours, and basically just took the piss out of my girlfriend, and women in general. It reminded me of girls taking the piss out of us. We all laughed loads at utterly shit jokes, and my friend C, who had had 16 seeds, kept describing what he was seeing in the ceiling nd stuff. Me and B just thought he was weird.    C just lay there whilst me and B went over to my desk. It was hard to get there as walking was damn near impossible. My legs just wrecked and were really stiff to move. I then saw myself in the window and began having a conversation. B and C just took the piss out of me but I was deadly serious. I stopped after a while and I said to B that I\'d give him \xa320 if he could bounce a mini basketball off the wall into the bin and make it stand up, which was impossible with the angle and small ball. But he tried and tried again, and suddenly this amazing game materialised, and we could relate every throw of the ball into a life experience. Like if it got stuck in a gap, this would be a difficlut situation that one must get out of if life was to continue. We were laughing and taking it really seriously, and then D came back up from downstairs. He wanted to join but me and B told him to get lost as it was our game. Loads of rules had suddenly materialised. Then C walked past us looking really, really ill. His eyes were just black, and his face bright red, and he could hardly walk. We all called him \'Tramp, Bum etc\' and he just ignored us. However he came back up 20 minutes later and looked like shit. He said \'Lads I really think something is wrong\' . We just laughed and said no way.     But he started freaking and saying he wasn\'t going to make it through the night and we all got scared. He kept sating it again and again. He said he couldn\'t imagine the next day\'s sky and would do anything to see it. He said he had written a suicide note a few days back and it seemed really ironic that it was happening now. We got shit scared and one of my friends went to talk to him. When he came back he said he looked weird and was acting strange. I went over and his whole chest and arms were like blue/grey! I nearly died. I was thinking of calling an ambulance but my friend D persuaded me not too. After that we just all sat there and fretted until 4:00AM. B and D both fell asleep and it was just me and C talking. He kept saying \'I hope I\'m the same tomorrow man\' and I kept saying he would be but I didn\'t know. We then stopped talking and tried to sleep but I couldn\'t. I was getting some wicked closed eye visuals - really nice stuff. But I couldn\'t sleep for thinking of my friend as this paranoid depressed dickhead forever.     When we woke it was so awkward. We just looked at each other for ages, not saying anything, watching the telly with mute on. In the end we just left one by one, with hardly any words explained because of what we had learnt about C.     On monday at school he said he had never actually wrote it and his head made it all up. I believe him, though D is more skeptical.     I\'m blown away by LSA and if it wasn\'t for the constant nausea it would be fucking ace. Just make sure you ain\'t depressed when taking it though!"
420,A Mellow Mind,Dave Bel-Aire,"Jun 30, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Last night, Thursday, 2/17/00, I decided to try Hawiian Baby Woodrose seeds to fulfill my curiosities.  At four PM on Wednesday I scraped (the dried fuzz on the seeds) eight HBWR seeds and roasted them for a few seconds over a candle (to make sure they were good and cleaned). Then using a very clean coffee grinder I ground the seeds into a coarse powder (the best I could get) and put them into some kool-aid. I let the mixture sit in the fridge covered for 24 hours.    On Thursday I made it a point to eat nothing at all, only a can of mountain dew for breakfast and water, cause I read that HBWR can make you nauseus. At a quarter to five I held my nose and chugged the concoction which didn\'t taste all to terrible. I then went to my best friend\'s house (who happens to live next door to me) to wait for the fun to begin. We popped in a DVD, pleasantville, at five. About half way into the movie (6:30) I started getting that kind of queasy headache feel, kinda like after downing a bottle of tussin, but not as intense, it was bearable and started to go away soon. I noticed an intense fascination with the movie almost as if I was fully a part of it, I realized I was intensely transfixed when my friend had to shake me to to respond to his question which I hadn\'t even heard.     I have dosed on acid a few times and hit the dxm rush more times than I care to recall so all of this is going to be compared with acid or dxm. Also I will say right now this is not the same as acid it is rather more like a good dxm rush.     When the movie ended around 7PM I was feeling great, body movement was an interesting procedure, when I got up to pee (which I found myself doing alot) it was as if I were moving in many different directions all at once. My friend (who was stone sober) suggested we take a walk so he could smoke some weed, I would have toked up too if I wasn\'t being tested, I proceeded to walk along with strange vigor. Unlike most drugs, HBWR does not change your perception of cold, which it was, it was frosty balls outside but I didn\'t mind. The closest thing I can compare it to was the peak of a dxm rush after smoking entirely too much weed, you know that warm fuzzy feeling in the back of your head right behind your eyes. It is about eight PM when we get back, I find myself fascinated with fire, which oddly enough didn\'t burn rather it just felt warm, real warm judging by the blisters on my fingers which just started hurting today, my friend was playing the piano while I sat gazing into the flame of a candle, feeling as if my body was falling into a pleasant warmth.     An hour later I decided to go home and try to play some playstation, bad idea- it just messes with your head and gives you that naucis headache which didn\'t go away.     About 10PM I started slowly coming down, I was still real fascinated with everything, I couldn\'t stop watching qvc for like a half hour. By this time I was pretty straight with only a mild buzz to keep me goin\'.     The whole experience was very similar to high doses of marijauna smoke coupled with the intense fascination and mellow mood one gets from a good clean dxm trip, not cough syrup but rather powder or pure dxm without ephedrine in it.     My suggestion for dosing on HBWR is to go see something with friends like a movie or a show that you can sit and become entranced in. For the most part I was completely coherent (if my parents couldn\'t tell I was all jacked up no one could have) so I think it is a good drug to take before going out with friends or take it with friends, either way it\'s a fun time. I did however get a headache real bad about midnight, I think that might have been do to dehydration because HBWR makes you pee like mad, so the next time I do it (which will be for the rocky horror picture show next weekend) I will be sure to drink Plenty of water to keep hydrated.     After some advil I was out like a light until I woke up at 10AM totally refreshed and feeling great, with no unpleasant hangover effects.    This has been the account of my experience I hope you use the information to have a safe and happy trip to a hawiian paradise.      P.S. I will write about the rocky horror picture show and tell you how it went."
1946,A Collection of Experiences,Various,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I recently tried a new route of administration for Hawiian Baby Woodrose seeds. Why? Eating works fine, except for the unfortunate side effect that my stomach is so tight I don\'t want to eat, drink, or move.    I tried the enema method recommended by a previous poster. It was dissappointing. I ground ten seeds and blended them for an hour in distilled water. Then I filtered the sludge out and used a home enema kit to put the brown juice up my ass. I left it there for about ten minutes. About half an hour later, I felt a little something like a trip, but it quickly went away.    So what is my new method? Chewing -- like tobacco. I chewed six seeds without spitting or swallowing for 15 minutes, then gagged and spit them out. I tripped about as hard as I would expect from eating four seeds, but with much diminished side effects. After the first hour I felt like drinking beer and dancing (the don\'t-move period lasts three hours if I swallow the seeds).     My next experiment is to treat them *exactly* like tobacco, using a spittoon. Maybe I can chew them that way for 30 minutes or more. They are fairly cheap, so doubling the quantity is not a problem.    =========================================================================    From: Pope Electric Yeti   Newsgroups: alt.drugs   Subject: Baby Hawaiian Woodrose   Date: Jan 1994    I had a really bad trip on these once, good at first, like being drunk with trippy visuals.Then everything started to spin and I got sick. I became really scared and convinced that I was going to die. I had to go to a friends house to chill out when it was all over. Never again...Spend your money on good blotter or \'shrooms, but you *really* might want to stay away from this one....    =========================================================================    From: Keith Lewis   Newsgroups: alt.drugs   Subject: Woodrose seeds from T.A.E.   Date: May 1994    Two different shipments of HBWR seeds from the same source, two years apart.    #1 (then): Seeds were light brown and had concave spots with a very hard shell. ~150 mg.    #2 (now): Seeds are dark brown and *hairy*. They are almost double the size (~275 mg). Convex, with an equally hard shell.    What\'s the deal? Were the old ones immature? What about potency? These new things scare me!    =========================================================================    From: William Eleazer   Newsgroups: alt.drugs,alt.hemp   Subject: Hawaiian Baby Woodrose   Date: May 1994    Well I sent off to T.A.E for some Baby Wood Rose Seeds and they convinced me to get the sample kit which consisted of maybe 200 hemp seeds (precooked), about 25 each of Wood Rose and Baby Wood Rose seeds. A friend and I rubbed the hairs off of 8 Baby Wood Rose seeds, ground them to a pulp in a mortar and pestle, split it in half, mixed it with a cup of coffee and drank the mix. We had to spoon out the grit ( the ground Baby Wood Rose Seeds) out because it all sunk to the bottom. When I did this it tasted exactly like what really good blotter tastes like, but the taste went away pretty quickly. There was no ensuing trip. Anyone have any comments?    =========================================================================    From: PGuest   Newsgroups: alt.drugs.psychedelics   Subject: Woodrose (What did they do wrong?)   Date: Sep 1994    A FOAF recently received their shipment of Baby Hawaian (sp?) Woodrose seeds. Reading that the normal dosage was 4 to 8 seeds, they took 6 seeds, singed off the white fuzz, ground them in a coffee bean grinder, placed the powder in empty capsules, and swallowed with water (on an empty stomach).    There was NO effect whatsoever. Did they do something wrong, or is the talk of woodrose overrated?    =========================================================================    From: Dominic Blais  Newsgroups: alt.drugs   Subject: HBWR seeds failed...   Date: Jan 1995    A FOAF bought two hundred Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds from OTJ... recently. He tried 20 with no effects... then waited a few days and tried 50 with again, no effects. He gave a friend 15 to see if it was just him, but the friend didn\'t experience anything either. He ended up gulping down the remaining 115 seeds a few days later. Guess what... no effects. [Erowid Note: Warning, This is not recommended. While some seeds may have no activity, or some individuals may not experience effects, 115 seeds could be a gigantic overdose.] The seeds looked like others he had bought (to grow) and he has never had any other experiences with HBWR or morning glory. Any ideas?"
1945,Is the FAQ Bullshit?,Clarence Darrow,"Jun 19, 2000",Large Hawaiian Woodrose,"A friend of mine tried the extraction from the file FAQ-MorningGlory-Part1 and had absolutely no results. No nausea, no effects, no nothing. He got LBWR seeds instead of HBWR because at the time they were cheaper and according to the faq they had the same percentage of alkaloids. He prepared the seed material using lighter fluid and then let the stuff sit in the ethanol for twice the recommended time (8 days). He got up on Sat morning at dawn with all of his trippy toys prepared the night before and was real pissed that nothing happened. Since I was the one who gave him the faq he blames me too for screwing up his whole weekend and tells me I\'m full of shit. He\'s a bit excitable at times (-:    So anyway what\'s the deal? If you tried the extraction and it worked for you please post here or email me. If you tried the extraction and it *didn\'t* work for you please post here or email me. I will summarize to the net if I get a lot of email responses. I have to admit that the part about absorbing enough to feel effects by swishing the stuff around in your mouth (has anyone ever tried holding pure ethonol in your mouth anyway? I drank straight everclear in highschool once and thought I would die) but I digress."
1944,Story and Advice,Jake,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Well, yesterday a FOAF and his friends had their first experience with Hawiian Baby Wood Rose seeds, which my FOAF later dubbed \'The wacky russian rulette of acid\'. Four people ate the seeds, three of them tripped, each with varying degrees of intensity. They had some wisdom that they thought I should pass on to the net.    One thing to keep in mind is that these seeds are naturally growing botanicals and due to each plants idiosyncracies one cannot reliably estimate how much LSA one is ingesting by the number of seeds you eat. One of my FOAF\'s friends ate three seeds and had a typical mild acid trip (intense colors, trails, and mild synthenesia). Another one had nine seeds and got absolutely no effect. Two others ate nine and had moderate trips, one good and one not so good (more later). My FOAF had twenty seeds and had the most intense trip of his life, including phantom music, very intense and dramatic synthenesia, and occasional withdrawls from reality, where his normal vision was completely obscured by intense patterns and colors... kinda scary sometimes. As you can see, your milage may vary.    No one got physically ill as a result of taking the seeds, although one of my FOAF\'s friends admitted, after eating the seeds, that he thought he might be coming down with the flu. STUPID! Twice during the evening he began to feel nausiated and dizzy, and when he did, he correspondingly reported having \'uncool\' experiences and went off by himself for a while. This morning he is down but suffering from the flu.    Although the seeds have a reputation as being \'weak\' acid, my FOAF would not recommend that they are eaten by the unexperienced user, since they had such a wide range of effectiveness. Getting acid with a reliable mic count would be a better way to go at first, to add a bit more control to the already unpredictable activity of dropping.    That\'s all for now. I hope this is of use to someone. I\'ve learned much from alt.drugs, and it\'s good to return the favor!    Happy tripping!"
1943,A Bit Weird and Distorted,Eric,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Well, since everyone else shares their psychedelic experiences with the net, I feel I should too, especialy since it was with a legal one that people have their doubts about.    My friend Joe and I had been trying to find some good legal drugs for a while, and had mostly turned up blank. Finally got some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. About 120 in all. I took 20 seeds, ground them up in a peper grinder, mixed with about a quart of water, let them soak for a while (Several hours), then strained and drunk. The water tasted kinda wierd, sorta like some kind of nut, but I couldn\'t quite identify it. After 15 minutes we were both feeling a little \'weird\'. We hung out in Joe\'s living room for a while, and after about 50 mins I noticed some typical pre-LSD pre-Shroom effects on the floor. Where the floor looks like boards that are sliding past one anohter in oppisite directions. Seems to happen to me whenever I trip, even only a little. My hands also felt slimy. I noticed this effect once before while on LSD. ALl the feeling in my body got very slimy and milky. In a way, it was like touch-tracers.     I was no longer able to feel and individual feeling, but instead a whole bunch at once, kind of after images of what I had been touching. It really didnt get that intense. After about 2 hours we went into the kitchen, and my hands started looking very wierd and distorted. I would hold my arms out to the floor, and the looked VERY long, almost as if they were touching the floor. We also got kind of silly, and I had problems putting what I was trying to say into words. VERY few visuals. Things really never got much beyond this stage.     There might have been a more intense mental effect, but we never really tried to explore that. When I previously tripped on acid, we found that the \'psychedelic\' effect didn\'t really set in until we started talking about philisophical type thigns, but once we did, it didn\'t stop. So maybe if we had tried talking meta-physics.. who knows. After 5 hours we got mad and smoked some REALLY good bud.     Its now 24 hours later and I still feel the slimy hands effect a little bit. Interesting if your bored. I think it would also make a good first psychedelic expereince. Maybe I just feel this way because my first trip on acid was a little too intense and I got scared. We plan to try them again on sunday or monday. This time I\'m gonna try 24 seeds, and also drink the seeds chunks. Oh also, we did not experience any nausea at all."
1942,Two Experiences,Tommy the Tourist,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"After reading alt.drugs for a while and checking out the FAQ\'s at hyperreal.com [Erowid Note: Now available at http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/], I decided to try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. I ordered 100 from Of The Jungle ($10). All of the information on Morning Glories and HBWR is pretty contradictory. The extraction sounded a bit questionable, so I decided to risk the nausea and just use water/lemon juice as one netter suggested.    I started with six seeds. There wasn\'t any \'white coating\' on them like the faqs had implied. They looked like tan chocolate chips. I washed them to be sure. They were ground in a pepper grinder, then placed in an 8oz Ball jar with ~3oz of lemon juice and ~3 of water and shaken occasionally for the next two hours. Most of the articles said to strain it through a coffee filter, but it wouldn\'t go through so I used a papertowel and funnel, which worked pretty well. I added sugar and it was like a weedy lemonade, slightly foul.     A buddy of mine dropped by about then. While we talked I felt the nausea come on. It wasn\'t too bad so I decided to wait it out rather than barf. After ~45 it subsided into the backround and I was feeling really buzzed. It was kind of like a sine wave building and receding every few minutes and I felt pretty speedy. We walked over to some friends\' house. My pupils were dilated as hell so I could see really well in the dark. It was a strange sensation. Once there, I was feeling both speedy and kind of drowsy, like I\'d taken half a hit with a good bowl. This lasted for about 4 hours and the nausea faded away. We walked back and I could still see in the dark pretty well. I was almost down, but felt fantastic. By then it had been 7 hours since I\'d drunk the \'lemonade\'. We ate pizza and watched television for an hour or so, then crashed. I had a little trouble falling asleep, but slept soundly when I did and the next morning I felt great. All in all a damn nice time, well worth the nausea (and only cost $.60!).    The next weekend, a local music festival was going on, a perfect time to try them again. This time it was only five seeds and instead of straining them, I put the ground seeds in a sealable tea bag, but otherwise the methodology was the same. I drank it around noon and the nausea hit almost immediately. This time it was nasty, about like motion sickness. I rode it out, but probably should have barfed. Again, it only lasted about 45 minutes, but they were ugly. An hour after I took them I felt much better and we (my girlfriend) decided to go to the show. The walk there was \'interesting\'. I was buzzing quite nicely and the nausea was way in the backround. I felt pretty the same as before, speedy and somewhat stoned. We walked around for a bit and my girlfriend decided to go to a nearby restaurant. They took twenty minutes to fix her food, so I sat outside watching traffic.     After a few minutes, thing started to get weird. One of the buildings was breathing and I completely track of time. I started getting confused. Nothing specific, just not quite right. By the time she\'d gotten her food, I was flying. We started back to the show, but a few blocks later I felt an extreme need to sit somehwere quiet, preferably home, so we headed back. Things got ugly fast. All of a sudden I felt lost and incredibly depressed. I kept in mind that it was just the drug, and maintained until we got home. I didn\'t want my girlfriend to realize how bad it was and worry her so I just kept quiet and played it cool, which worked. As soon as we got home, I sat in my reliner and turned on a local accustic station and started to feel more normal, but I was still pretty depressed and felt terrible about myself and the nausea had gotten worse.     For the next three hours as long I was talking, listening or concentrating on something, I was OK. If I started to drift, things got weird. My girlfriend left for work without noticing how bad I was. I was still flying, but tired so I sort of fell asleep. I dreamed that I was walking on a cold shore and there were treeless hills in the backround, like moors. I was talking to someone, as we walked, but never got a clear picture of them. After a bit, the person turned and shoved me backwards and I woke up suddenly, feeling like I\'d been dropped into the chair from above. I was weirded out, but felt better. Still tired, though, so I lay down and slept for a couple of hours. After than I was still tripping slightly, but not too bad. I was really ready for it to end. It was another two hours, before it wore off completely. About 8 hours since I drank the stuff. Again, I felt great and hungry, but a little shaken as well. I\'m glad that I hadn\'t taken more, or I would have really freaked. Not one of my better experiences overall.     Do they work? Damn right.Will I do them again? Yeah, at least once more. Next time I will try the extraction outlined in the MG faq. Part of the problem with mixed reactions, I believe, has to do with potency of each individual seed. The way I intend on getting even doses is to start with 30-40 seeds and adjust doses as portions of that to even out the LAA levels."
1941,HBWS Works for Me!,Charles Horowitz,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"After not reading for a while, I tried to catch up with the news and read several negative posts concerning Hawaiin Babay Woodrose Seeds, so I thought I\'d relate my experience with them. First off, my one time with them (Havent really had 8 hours to blow on them), about 2 weeks ago had some litigating circumstances which could have effected them. First I had only 2 hours of sleep the night before, and second I took 8 of them (with the white fungus coating scraped off) at about midnight. About 3 minutes after completely chewing them, I began feeling really slow and lazy, and got pretty hot and uncomfortanble(i had not taken any dramamine). I got the dry heaves a few times, but since I hadnt eaten in hours, I was OK.     After about 40 minutes of this hot, nauseous really lazy feeling, with no trippy results, I said, forget it! and went to bed. About an hour and a half later I woke up feeling like I was on a boat in a hurricane. My equilibrium was completely out of whack, so I got up to get some water. When I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror, I saw that my pupils were the size of the entire iris, so guessing that the seeds had worked, I stepped back about a foot and began to stare at myself to see what would happen. Unfortunately, I had taken my lenses out to go to sleep so I was now nearly blind, however, sure enough, I began to warp and twist and invert into myself. I also noticed at this point that the dizzy feeling was gone and now I actually felt rather euphoric.     I noticed that the walls were breathing rather gently. I spent the next few hours experimenting and pretty much determined that I could will what would happen (i.e., I could stare at my hand and make my fingers grow really long, etc). I spent a few minutes talking to the ceiling (those circular light holes sure look like mouths, especially when their breathing). I only got to talk to one person that night and the floor was breathing, and he kept rising and falling about a foot and a half up and down, rather amusingly.     Anyway, by four or so I began feeling really tired so I tried to go back to bed. Unfortunately I couldnt stay asleep for more than a few minutes at a time as anytime I laid down, that dizzy, off balance feeling returned, yet whenever I stood or sat, I felt really close to euphoria. Finally got to sleep at about 8, and didnt wake up until 3 or so, and felt really strung out the rest of the day.    Im hoping that next time I try these, its with sleep, and dramamine and a little earlier in the day, but overall I rather enjoyed the exp."
1940,1st Time Tripping,Terry,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"This message is rather long... If you\'re experienced, don\'t bother.    My friend Russ and myself had been doing research into psychedelics as well as other drug types, trying to find out what we could get a hold of legally, as well as how to ingest them, etc..    After getting barely any effects from a (botched) yage potion involving Syrian rue and canary grass, we were ready to try something that required little culinary skill, as well as a quicker ingestion. Drinking two big glasses of grass-juice was not fun, even on an adventurous level. So we both decided that HWBR seeds would be the best bet for a sure-fire psychedelic experience.    Neither I nor Russ had used anything like LSD, or even MJ for that matter before using HBWR seeds. The closest we\'d come had been a very nice absinthe experience (Pernod + 3 tspns Wormwood). So, needless to say, we were very naive when we decided that 10 seeds would be a nice dosage for each of us. (Like I said, we were very inexperienced, and were let down by other attempts using natural, legal substances.)    We were expecting nausea, lethargy, and, hopefully, some blissful euphoria.     We awoke at 8:00a on what would turn out to be a beautiful Spring day, and crushed our seeds up for ingestion (we\'d scraped off the outer coating the day before). Eagerly, we gobbled up the seeds. Of course, they tasted horrid, and I could feel them getting stuck in my teeth. But, it had to be done! Once swallowed, Russ and I waited in my den for the feelings to begin.    The only one else who would be in the house that day was my brother, Scott, who had no concept of what Russ and I were doing, and most likely would not approve. So, him being home, and us trying to keep him from becoming suspicious, made for a potential paranoia session. I wasn\'t afraid, but Russ hadn\'t visited my home before, and had just met Scott, so he had some paranoia going in. I should\'ve known...    Less than fifteen minutes after ingestion, both Russ and I were sitting/lying on the floor feeling very weak and disoriented. We were both prepared for that. I knew that we\'d soon be puking, so I went and got a small trash bin to receive our liquid presents. We both began feeling cold in our extremities (a feeling that neither of us was fond of), and soon we were both ready to puke. I can\'t remember who went first, I think it was myself. But soon we were residents of Vomitville.     After puking for a bit, I drank some water and tried to get comfortable on my double papasan. Pulling up a blanket, I sat and dove headfirst into my first psychedelic journey. I will try to describe what I felt.    The first good feeling that I noticed was what I referred to as the \'hum\'. Some sort of buzzing that felt like the alternating current of the time-space continuum (yeah, right). My body itself wasn\'t feeling very good. Extremities were cold and slightly numb, and if I moved, my stomach ached. I stayed still, closed my eyes, and let my mind wander. I noticed a tightness in my chest, breathing had changed. Involuntarily, my breathing was slow and shallow, similar to deep sleep. Voluntarily, I felt as if I could hold my breath forever, and that if I so wished, I could hold my breath until I died (silly, but that\'s how it felt). So I would try holding my breath for periods of time, and as I did, the visions and thoughts became more intense. The longer I refrained from inhaling, the brighter and more vivid the mindscape became, swirling with bright light and humming with a flow that followed the energy surrounding and penetrating everything. It was quite beautiful. I kept thinking \'this is what death is like\'. And, something in the mindscape affirmed my thoughts, it said that, \'yes, this is the place your mind goes at death.\' I kept smiling. I felt as if I had tapped into something that very few people would ever know of, until they themselves died. This made me very happy. It was bliss.    Russ, on the other hand, was not having such a good time. All the while I was feeling the aforementioned, Russ would interrupt me once every five or so minutes to ask if I was \'O.K.\'. He\'d say, \'I don\'t know, you just looked strange. I\'m just making sure you aren\'t dead or anything.\' I tried to explain to him what I was feeling, it was difficult to describe, and I don\'t think he was experiencing the same things. I asked him how he felt, and he wasn\'t feeling to good. I finally got up from my comfort zone and sat with him to talk about it. He kept puking, and I was afraid he might dehydrate. So I kept the water nearby for him.     Scott was awake, and four hours had passed. We couldn\'t believe how time had moved so strangely. Russ was worried that Scott would come to the den and find out something was up, so we made up a story that Russ had a stomach virus, and we\'d stayed up most of the night (that\'s why we were so lethargic). Anyway, Scott came down to let our dogs in, and didn\'t say very much. He went back upstairs. Later, Scott was on the phone, and Russ became very worried that he was calling the paramedics. I tried to calm him down, but, shit. It was ridiculous. The paranoia had struck Russ hard. He got up, wandered around the pool table striking his had on it and saying \'Why? How could I be so stupid?\' It was a bad situation. Russ was paranoid that we\'d both been poisoned, and that Scott was suspicious, and that every little noise he heard was an ambulance coming to get us. I didn\'t know what to do. He almost had me worried about us. I just tried to logically explain what was going on, how he was getting worried over nothing, etc. Looking back, I should\'ve had some music going, and kept the lights up in the den. It was like a dungeon to Russ.    About 5-6 hours had passed. We were both sitting on the floor looking at the clock, trying to figure out what time it was. The hands were moving forwards, then backwards, hell. It was funny. Russ had calmed a bit, and we were talking about what was going on. We looked at each other and could see purple/orange splotches all over. I opened the door to the den, and sunlight poured in. We instantly felt better! I picked up my guitar and played a bit of \'Little Wing\'. I imagined Jimi Hendrix feeling the same feelings that I had.     Scott came down the stairs, and wished to use the computer. I knew it was time to go outside. I couldn\'t wait! The air, the light, the leaves, the sky, the clouds, the grass, the earth, the animals, everything took on a brilliance all its own. Russ and I laid in the back yard on our backs watching the sky. It was heavenly. Birds would fly by, and every little movement of their wings was noticeable. Russ and I discussed how we are all connected simply by being alive. The birds, the grass, the trees, everything.    I felt alienated somewhat from my family. Who are they, anyway? They\'re simply people who I live with, and nothing more. Bloodlines are a coincidence! We are all individuals! Something like that. Materialism was thrown way out the door. It was great! I could\'ve rolled around in dogshit, and I wouldn\'t have cared (though I tried not to). I really felt close to the earth and everything on it. It was wonderful.    Finally, it was time to come in and \'wait\' for the trip to end. About ten hours had passed, and Russ and I felt like shit. Unable to do anything complicated, and unwilling to do anything else. I took a shower and could feel every hair on my body. I thought about shaving my facial hair off completely. Nah. The lighting in the bathroom had a strange orange glow to it. It felt good to be clean. Around 10:30 Russ and I got hungry and ate a bit. It was like eating for the first time in days. I had folded some laundry, and it felt good to be doing something constructive.    Time for bed. Russ slept in the den, I went to my bedroom. I had much trouble getting to sleep. I felt half in, half out of the dream state. Not necessarily the hypogogic state, btw. I thought I heard Russ puking again, and sensed him in the bathroom on the other side of the wall. It got really bad, coughing and dry heaving, then suddenly it was as if he was choking, and he ran out of the bathroom, down the hall and flung open my door and sort of lunged at my bed to get my attention, then ran back out into the hall and collapsed. I truly felt all of this happening, and was quite frightened. I sat up slightly and looked at the door. It was closed. I had imagined the whole thing. So vivid!    The next morning I asked Russ how he\'d slept, he said \'great.\'    We were both very productive during the next day, as well as the next week. It was like coming home from a long vacation, anxious to get back to work. What a trip! We joke about the whole thing now, and every now and then I get a whiff or taste of something that reminds me of the HBWR seeds. YUK!!! Used coffee filters do it nicely. Horrible!    To anyone who is in the situation Russ and I were in, that of wanting to experiment, but not knowing where to start, I do NOT recommend HBWR seeds. Try MJ first, if you can, and then maybe MDMA, if you can, AND THEN move on to something LSD related, if not LSD itself. DO NOT START WITH HBWR SEEDS. And, don\'t start anyway if you are a paranoid goofball like Russ!"
1939,Tracers From Hell,BeerMe,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"My friend once ordered Hawaiian Woodrows, we mashed them up in a pepper grinder, mixed them with a 20 ounce bottle of water, and drank them, my girlfriend got sick and she threw it all up in a K-mart bathroom, I also got very nauseous, but I didn\'t throw up, I just kept spitting clear fluid, about an hour later, I got tracers from hell, and we were driving about 30 miles an hour and it felt like we were going about 60 downtown, I started to wig out hard core, from the time I started feeling it till the time I went to bed about 8 hours later, I still had tracers just as bad as when I first started feeling it, my pupils were all black, there was no color in my eyes at all, I couldn\'t believe the experience I was having, it was crazy, my girlfriend didn\'t feel any of it, and she drank the most, I had over 2/3 thirds of the drink and my friend probably had a little bit less than I did, and he experienced almost the same thing I did, but not as intense or to the extreme that I tripped, I have done acid once and I took 2 cubes, I never got tracers but my mind felt free, this was definitely the most psychedelic trip that I have had yet, the tracers were unbelievable."
1938,Ingestion Tips,Anonymous,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I have been following the thread on HBWR and felt it about time to share my own experiences in the area. By no means am I refuting anything already said, I am only offering my own experience for consideration to those willing to listen. I like the seeds. I have had rather nice experiences with them and will continue to use them from time to time. The worst physical side effect I have had from them was stomach cramping and that was without dramamine. The method I have used with the seeds is fairly simple. I grind up the number I am going to ingest and then soak them in water for an hour or two. Then I drain the water so as to seperate the seed matter from it. I toss the seed matter away (I don\'t remember where, perhaps Jonathon Ott, I\'ll check, but anyways, I remember reading that the alkaloids responsible for much of the toxic symptoms are not water soluble and therefore will remain in the seed matter). Anyways, the resulting drink I am left with I ingest over 30-45 minutes. This also seems to reduce the bad effects. The only part I find annoying is the lethargy, but that seems to be overcome by setting as I have had many enjoyable walks while under the effects although the first few steps took one hell of a lot of will power. I would suggest though that anyone interested in exploring these start out with a small amount and work their way up. A previous poster mentioned 20-30 seeds. I personally would never take that many seeds, at least not at this point in time. my max currently is about 13 or so. My first time was with 8 or 9. Well, hopefully someone found this to be of some value."
1937,Very Mellow,Anonymous,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I found myself ahead on a writing deadline and with nothing to do on a Tuesday afternoon, so I decided to experiment with Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. Although I had eaten a large meal the night before, I had had nothing to eat during the day, and so I hoped to avoid the nausea that had been reported by some users. This nausea is attributed either to the seeds themselves, or to coatings supposedly put on seeds by seed companies to discourage this sort of thing, depending on who you talk to. A third suspicion of mine was that people were more likely to try morning glory seeds than HBWR seeds, and that it takes a whole lot more of the former to feel any effects, and that it was the sheer quantity of the seeds that was causing nausea in these people. In any case, I\'m writing this at about 2:05PM and will find out shortly... :-`    HBWR seeds, like morning glory seeds, contain such nicely active ingredients as d-lysergic acid amide and d-isolysergic acid amide (a.k.a. ergine & isoergine) which are close relatives of your old friend and pal (can you believe she\'s 50?) d-lysergic acid diethylamide (a.k.a. LSD). According to Peter Stafford\'s \'Psychedelics Encyclopedia\' (3rd Expanded Edition, pp. 98-99):      \'Lysergic acid amides are quite concentrated in the seeds of this ornamental, much more so than in psychedelic morning glories. Four to six seeds (the contents of one or two pods) are the equivalent of 100 to 150 Ipomoea morning glory seeds and will produce a full-blown experience. The result is generally more tranquil than what is induced by LSD. While LSD is perceived by most users as having stimulant effects, to which a few people are particularly sensitive, the botanical sources have more of a slowing or depressant effect. Some users complain that they have had a hangover, which has been characterized by Emboden as possibly involving `nausea, vertigo, blurred vision and physical inertia.\' More often, however, these seeds have invigorated their users, leaving them feeling as though they had been on vacation afterwards.\'       Stafford recommended (with Morning Glories) that \'seeds should be ground to a flour before use; it\'s also a good idea to soak them in water -- the psychoactive components are soluble -- and then to strain the liquid through cheesecloth. The amides of value are in the liquid, which is ready for consumption.\' I did not follow this advice directly -- I soaked the whole seeds and put them in a blender.    I was also unable to find motion sickness tablets at the supermarket, and so am not testing out another piece of advice that was given to me -- take some dramamine before the seeds to reduce nausea.    Also mentioned by Stafford was that \'high dosages are not advisable -- beyond a certain level, experience so far has shown a tendency for limbs to get bluish\' (perhaps by the same gangrene-producing effect as that produced by the ergot fungus in `ergotism\'). I decided to look out for this effect as best as I could.    1:30 PM -- I covered six seeds with hot tap water in a small bowl.    1:50 PM -- I poured the seeds and water into a small food processor and chopped the seeds as well as I could. It was a bit like chopping up small, soft rocks. I then added some orange juice, a few frozen cherries, raspberries, and strawberries, and blended for another minute or so.    2:00 PM -- I began to drink the resulting mixture, and I packed a small bowl of marijuana to smoke to combat possible nausea. My hope was that the effects of the marijuana would have vanished by the time the HBWR seeds began to work their wonders.    2:15 PM -- I am nicely high and reaching the bottom of my psychic smoothie.    2:25 PM -- I am very high and have finished off said smoothie.    2:45 PM -- Wow, that was great dope. No nausea yet.    3:10 PM -- Got munchies; had some soda crackers. No nausea or other ill effects. Still feel pleasantly high. I cannot tell at this juncture whether this is just good dope or whether HWBR are starting up.    3:45 PM -- At this point I am experiencing nothing that I cannot plausably attribute to lingering marijuana effects.    4:00 PM -- By now, I would have expected the marijuana effects to have just about ended. I\'m experiencing mild visual distortions (walls breathing) and some tactile enhancement (carpet between my toes feels nice). Nothing like a \'full-blown experience\' yet. Also, there is very minor auditory enhancement, and some of those LSD leg jitters (wanting to keep time to some beat about 4x/second).    4:30 PM -- Became sleepy, started to doze off during \'Voodoo Chile.\' Was awakened by bass guitar shaking my left foot. Still no nausea or ill effects, but I\'m most definately stoned. Sort of like LSD, but without the early rush. More like what LSD would be like if you missed the first four hours. Either that, or I\'m just starting the climb.    5:05 PM -- No increase in effects. If this is all there is, I\'m not too impressed.    5:30 PM -- Doesn\'t seem to be going anywhere. I just feel mildly strange and slightly uncoordinated.    6:00 PM -- Still slightly stoned. Ate vegies and bread and cheese. Not much happening. I think I\'ll try a few more seeds next time and see how that works. This must be one of those \'physical inertia\' trips... Oh well, better luck next time.    7:35 PM -- Am almost completely down. In retrospect, it wasn\'t completely unexciting, and with the right set and setting might have been very nice. Very mellow, though. Not too much going on. Much less auditory effects than I would expect from LSD or marijuana. No limb bluing, no nausea."
1936,Happy and Harmonious,Eric,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Well, a few days ago I posted my experience with some Hawaiian Baby woodrose seeds, and I mentioned that I would be trying them again. well here are the latest results...    Joe and i had found that our previous dose, (20 seeds total) was rather week. We didn\'t know if this was just the nature of the seeds, or if a higher dose would be needed. This time we ground up about 30 seeds and soaked them in some water. Ugghg. This stuff has got to be the worst tasting liquid in the entire world. It was horrible. When we first did it, the taste wasn\'t that noticeable, and when we did notice it, we just found it \'wierd\'. ugghg. I am planning on NEVER NEVER NEVER again ingesting the seeds in this method. Anyhow, after 2 hours, we strained off the liquid and drank. Once again, we felt kind of wierd after 20 mins or so. The two hours were hardly different that the time before, but in the 3rd hour, things got very very cool.    I would not call it a \'trip\'. There were almost no visual effects at all. And the mental effects didnt\' seem like acid or shrooms, but almost more like alcohol. We drove (big mistake) to mcdonalds after 2 hours, because we didnt\' feel like much was happening. we got drive through and ate in the car. We suddenly started feeling very silly and VERY happy. I mean VERY happy. When we had done acid before we had also gotten very happy and this was the same kind of thing. It was also kind of like pot, except when your high with someone, you tend to ignore them, and they tend to ignore you, and you each bable on about nothing. with the seeds, we seemed very connected. We decided we should drive home before the effects got any worse (better?). While I was driving, my car felt VERY wierd. It seemed much too long and I kept thinking I was too far away from the petals. We managed to get back to joe\'s house ok, and we talked with his sister and his sister\'s friend for a while. his sister\'s friend happens to be a chemist and she gave me all sorts of tips on extracting DMT from various plants. But back to the seeds. We then sat outside on the porch just talking. Everything felt very good. Not good like feeling good, as in sex, but good as in happy and harmonious. Understand that it is very hard for me to express just exactly how I was feeling. I felt as if I really understood the world, and how everything fit togeater. I looked at this plant, and just for a second, I understood the plant. This may seem like a wierd statment, but thats the best way to describe it. I stared at this plant for a while, and then suddenly I stoped thinking about anything, and just looked and watched as a drop of water slowly gilded off one of it\'s leaves, and right then for only a second, EVERYTHING made sense. It was one of the neatest feelings i have ever had. These effects contiued and we jsut sat around talking.     The total experience lasted only 3 hours. The 2 hours before and after this we very mild, and not really part of the \'trip\'. i HIGHLY recommend these seeds. But dont be expecting acid or shrooms. Its not like that at all, and you probalby wont have any hallucinations.     Does anyone know of, or can think of any way to do these seeds withough sticking them in your mouth in any way? or at least withougt having to taste them? We thought about smoking them, but were unsure if the compounds could stand up to the heat. any help would be appreciated."
1935,Major Tactile Hallucinations,Anonymous,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Last night, two of my friends and I decided to try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds. We went to the local head shop and got ten each, took them home and set out to remove any coating. We had heard/read that we should take anywhere from 6-15 seeds each, and after consulting with the clerk, who we knew, and had done them on several occasions, we settled on 8 each, expecting a fairly decent trip.     We got them home and scraped off all of the coating to the best of our ability, and then washed them off. We were careful to remove all of the coating, scraping off the coating and part of the shell with x-acto knives. (Realizing that we\'d still get part of the coating, but still wishing to keep it to a minimum.)     After scraping and washing, we crushed the seeds up and placed them aside for later. \'K\' and \'G\' had to work, so we were going to do them when they got off.    Around 9pm \'K\' and \'G\' came over and we downed the seeds. I had not eaten for about 6hrs, \'K\' for about 3, and \'G\' had just eaten.     After 15 min. I had started to feel the effects. The onset was like being dizzy, or groggy after having just gotten up. In about 20 min, K started to feel the same effects while G just felt sick to his stomach. This feeling of groggyness persisted until 10:30, when I proceeded to throw up violently. K said he was feeling fine, and was beginning to have what he termed \'A really mellow trip\' G still only felt sick.    I felt much better after my episode, but was still feeling drained, so I decided to leave K and G and go to bed. This is what they told me happened to them. They went to get something to eat around 12:30 (when I went to bed). they walked around in some woods near where we live, and said it was pleasant. Quite like a very mild trip, then around 2:00, they split up and went home thinking it was over.     When G got home (about 2:30) he said he became violently ill, and lost everything he had eaten the entire day. He then tried to go to sleep.    K said he went home and tried to sleep, but found himself peaking, experiencing a dizzying trip with very intense tactile, and visual hallucinations. He got up from bed and ended up wandering over to G\'s house without putting on any additional clothing (wearing only bed-shorts) and then sitting on his steps crying. G didn\'t experience this sort of peak at all, and found that he was able to calm K down by talking him out of it. (K said afterwards it was like he imagined a bad trip being like. We have done acid on *many* occasions together, and have *never* had a bad experience with acid). After G talked him down, they both managed to sleep, and awoke today feeling a little hungry, and just generally groggy.    Meanwhile, I had gone home, still feeling a bit queasy, and decided that I needed sleep more than anything, so I laid down (at 12:30 or so) and tried to sleep. I managed to get to sleep okay, my stomach still aching a bit, and slept fine until 3:30.     At 3:30 I awoke in the midsts of the most intense trip I have ever experienced. My thoughts were totally random and I was experiencing *intense* visuals from the moonlight shadows in my room. I managed to stand up, and found that so incredibly difficult that I had to lay back down. My roomate then came out of his room to go to the bathroom, and I found this to be more than I could take... His image against the shadows in my room through me into some really wild hallicinations of wolves and various creatures devouring my flesh. In addition to the visuals, I was getting *major* tactile hallucinations from my sheets. My skin felt like I was being tickled everywhere, and was in the throws of a major orgasm. (Not unpleasant mind you ;) However it was a bit too intense for my tastes. I had several hallucinations of animal images, combined with the urge to run. I contemplated running over to see K and G and if they were having this stuff happen too, but when my roomate appeared, I was too scared to move much. I found it extremely difficult to diferentiate between reality and my hallucinations. (I didn\'t like this aspect of it at all. When I trip on acid, I usually find that, even though I do hallucinate, I am still conscious of the fact that they are only hallucinations. On the seeds I really couldn\'t tell.)    After laying there hallucinating I fell asleep. I don\'t know how long I was hallucinating, I was really not interested in timing it either. Around 10, I woke up, and my stomach really hurt. (could have been the seeds, could have been the vomit...) I managed to get something to eat and return to sleeping for a while. I woke up again at noon, feeling well rested, but a bit groggy. I\'ve been in that same groggy state all day.    Overall, I\'ll say that it was worth the experiment to satisfy my curiosity. However, I will not be trying these things again. Ever. First, I have a no vomit rule about drugs... that\'s why I gave up drinking. Second, I didn\'t find the peak as thrilling, or as fun as LSD. I still think Acid has the most bang for buck, and give much more pleasurable feelings while peaking. Perhaps the dose was just too high, but based on the feelings in my stomach, I think I\'ll just stick to good ol\' LSD and MJ."
1934,Learning to Respect Ergot Alkaloids,Anonymous,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"How I learned to loathe myself and respect ergot alkaloids    Here\'s the situation, kids; see if you can find where I went horribly, tragically wrong: Several weeks ago, over a period of a couple of months, my lover and I of four and a half years broke up, I lost my job and subsequently my home, and had a brief fling which punched holes in my reputation and self-image.    Still managing to convince myself that I was the free-spirit, untouched by the illusionary material world, I put on a happy face et cetera. A few days ago, however, I started to dwell on thoughts of self-doubt, worry, mild paranoia, and depression.    Drum roll please.    So I thought I\'d take a psychedelic drug and see if that helped to put things back in perspective.    WRONG! What, was I out of my mind? Lesson number one in the psychedelic universe: Don\'t use a psychedelic drug as a mood-lifter, to escape bad feelings, or to make a bad situation better. It don\'t work that way.    The pharmacological details: A couple of days prior to the experiment, I ground up fifty Hawaiian Baby Woodrose (Argyreia nervosa) seeds in a mortar and pestle, and put the resulting powder into gel caps. There were about 3.5 seeds per gel cap, with even potency across all of the gel caps.    Part of the motivation for my experiment was to test the potency/toxicity of the seeds taken in this manner. I had taken ten seeds, cracked in water, and had a terrific trip; and I had taken twelve seeds in a similar way and been wracked with nausea, stupor, and a generally bad time.    So I took two capsules, what I expected to be about 2/3rds of a real dose. My notes follow (indented) with comments (not indented):      1:00 PM - two caps       I had also been taking ginseng fairly regularly for the previous week or two, and I don\'t know how these two drugs might have reacted. What I believed I had been noticing from the ginseng were the following symptoms: a) increased creativity, b) more alertness without caffeine jitteryness, c) slight paranoia. Of course any of the above could also be the result of a placebo effect, or of the emotional turmoil in my life.    I was not taking any other drugs at the time. I had smoked a good hunk of weed the previous afternoon.      1:30 - slight runs, tight bridge of nose       The slight runs were slightly loose bowels, I included them in my notes without knowing whether or not they represented the first symptoms of nausea. In the aftermath, I\'d say that it was just coincidence. The tight bridge of nose was one of those bells that goes off in my mind and says to me, \'remember, you just took a psychedelic and here it comes!\'      1:35 - tight top of head       Similarly.      1:45 - stomach grumbling       This was probably caused more by the drug, but I\'m not sure. There wasn\'t much nausea (thank God) at all this time. A little bit hit me at one point, but nothing in itself particularly bothersome.      2:40 - very slight nausea twinge, some peripheral visual distortion[, ] cold feet       There is the nausea I was talking about. By \'twinge,\' I mean that it was noticable, but not lasting. A moment would come and I would say, \'gee, I feel kind of sick to my stomach,\' but then it would go away. Could be explained by just the psychedelic coenesthetic fuzziness, but I don\'t think I was tripping that hard yet. Cold feet was a \'just in case\' marker for me. Stafford\'s \'Psychedelics Encyclopedia\' mentions that ergot alkaloids like those in HBWS and MGS can at higher doses cause the limbs to turn bluish. (See: ergotism). So far this hasn\'t happened to me, but I try to be alert for the effects. It was a chilly day, and my feet were propped up, so I think it was not a drug effect.      2:50 - More tummy rumbles.   3:00 - Take 500 mg C - folklore       I\'m two hours into the dose and not getting much out of it but some slight peripheral vision fuzziness and motion, and a weird overall feeling. So I try to augment the trip with Vitamin C. I have no idea if this works or not, but it\'s everpresent acid folklore, and it\'s harmless as far as I know.      4:15 - Tired, amotivational[, ] Somewhat trippy.       I think the trip started right about here - three hours and fifteen minutes after taking the powdered seeds. That\'s something I should stress right off the bat about HBWS - the curve is very very different from that of LSD. On LSD, you accelerate quickly to the peak (within an hour or two of taking the drug), and then spend another couple of hours or more at the peak before sliding slowly down to baseline.    With HBWR, you spend the first three to six hours just climbing to the peak, and then a shorter time falling back to baseline. I don\'t think I reached the peak until six or seven at night - five or six hours after taking the capsules. Quite a long ride, with none of the \'it\'s all downhill from here\' sense that you get if things get confusing on acid.      6:00 - emotionally depressed - No, make that fucking despondent       By this time things had started to go bad. I tried all of the traditional things to swing things around: Went to the bathroom, made some food, took a walk in the fresh air, turned on more lights, changed the music. Nothing worked.    I was feeling the beginnings of what would be a very panicked depressive episode. Nobody loved me, even the people I thought were my friends were really annoyed with me and talked about me behind my back, my pretensions had become such an integral part of my self-image that seeing them shattered was destroying my identity. I felt that if people knew who I really was, they would be disgusted or frightened and run away, and so I had to wear a mask, which of course was another way of keeping people at a distance from my real self, so there was no way I could win...    Whew. It was bad, folks. Going for a quick-paced walk helped, but only by keeping my mind busy thinking about route and traffic lights and whether or not it was going to rain. Overall the mood was still bad. I stopped by a donut shop to get a chocolate-covered devil\'s food donut with chocolate chips. Chocolate is another of my temperamental mood-lifters that I\'ve kept in my bag of acid trips for that rainy day when I need it. But the wisdom of this decision didn\'t stand up; I thought that when I crashed from the sugar high things would just be that much worse. So I tossed the donut away.      7:00 - Still depressed - some anaesthesia - pinches don\'t hurt as much as they should. Tripping at about maximum so far, but wish it would stop.       I should note at this point that there is a history of depression in my family, my younger brother is taking medication for depression, and most of the women on my mother\'s side of the family seem to have had some sort of breakdown in their past. So far, except for a period of bad depression in adolescence (which could have just been adolescence, of course), I\'ve escaped in terrific shape. My mood has been generally good, and my psychedelic trips have been 95% wonderful.    But, after a few hours of this nonsense, I was convinced that my bad mood and such over the previous days was part of a spiral into mental illness and that I was going straight to the funny farm. I was exhibiting a lot of the signs of a panic attack and severe depression, and I wasn\'t sure how much I could attribute to the drug, and how much was just me.    Remember that I had taken what I thought was 2/3rds of a good dose of HBWS, which I translated as about 2/3rds again of a reasonable dose of LSD. In other words, about half a hit: small potatoes for a veteran tripper.    The anaesthesia I\'m talking about was kind of interesting. At one point, I pinched the web of skin between my thumb and finger, and although I could feel the pain, it didn\'t seem to mean anything to me. So I pinched harder. Sure enough, the pain increased slightly, but it still didn\'t mean anything to me. So I pinched as hard as I could. Still, no injury I could get excited about, although there was clearly some tissue trauma.    Two things of note: One, this may have been an effect of the drug, and if so, is a new one to me. Two, severely depressed people sometimes engage in self- mutilation, and this may have been an inkling of that for me.      7:22 - Niacin       At this point I remembered another bit of folklore - the \'niacin abort.\' I decided to give it a try. I took one 100 mg tablet of niacin. I don\'t know if it did any good or not.    A little after this point - I was alone in the apartment, and had been alone through the whole trip - I called a very good friend and trip buddy, telling him that \'I\'m having a bad trip and I can\'t get out.\' I felt very ashamed, because one of my own rules for drug taking is that I can\'t use drugs to put obligations on other people. But my friend was happy to help me out, and was a soothing voice and a shoulder to lean on when I really, really needed one.    By this time, I felt like a raving nut. I would prop up my face in my hands, then cover my mouth with my hands, then bite my fingers, then rub my nose, then rub my hands through my hair, then rub my eyes, then bite my thumbnail, then lean my chin on my hand - all in the course of a couple of seconds. I thought that I probably sounded like that woman in the diner in the movie \'Slacker.\' (\'You shouldn\'t. You should not. You should\'t. You shouldn\'t. You shouldn\'t traumatize a woman sexually. You shouldn\'t. You should not...\')    Except that my dialogue was at the same time more coherent and more troubled: \'I feel so alienated. I look at people. I look at them talk. I look at people talk and I can\'t understand them. I mean I understand what they are saying, and I know what the words mean, but I don\'t understand the transaction that\'s taking place. I don\'t know the rules. I try to talk, but people look at me and expect me to say more and I don\'t know the rules. I look at people and I don\'t understand. Nobody knows who I am. I can\'t understand them. I\'m trying to say I feel alienated. Like I\'m not one of them. They\'re doing something when they talk and it\'s not in the words and I can\'t understand what it is.\'    I mean, really, really, bonkers call the men in the white suits stuff. Most of the above was in reference to a party I went to the night before where I didn\'t know very many of the people in attendance. They had social conventions in common, and shared interests (Star Trek and the Rocky Horror Picture Show) that I did not share with them, so in a way it was as though I\'d landed on another planet. But my feelings of alienation had been extrapolated to include the whole human race.    It was bad. I have new understanding for the tales of people who took acid and committed suicide. For a long time I thought of these tales as drug war propaganda or coincidence. Now I have a little more understanding of how a pre-existing depression could be catapulted into a state of absolute hopeless- ness under the influence of a psychedelic.      9:10 - Coming down finally.       And rapidly, too. The whole coming-down time seemed to take about fifteen minutes. One minute I was babbling nonsense and biting my fingers, the next minute I\'m sipping tea and putting some Paul Simon on the CD player. Perhaps the niacin took effect, or maybe thats the unfamiliar HBWS curve again.    What lessons can the readers of alt.drugs get from my tale of woe? HBWS did not give me a bad trip. HBWS gave me a powerful trip that was bad because of the soil the seeds were planted in: an emotionally troubled mind. HBWS is powerful juju. It\'s not a poor substitute for the real thing; it IS the real thing. My recommendation: Do not trip on a psychedelic drug if you\'re in a bad mood, depressed, or suffering from some sort of emotional turmoil. And, finally, think twice about tripping alone.    Personally, I\'m going to stay away from drugs, ginseng, chocolate, and concentrated sugar for a couple of weeks at least, just to do an evaluation of where my head\'s at and make sure I\'m not falling prey to the family curse. I feel much better this morning (last night I was sure I\'d never recover), although a bit apprehensive. I\'m going to treat psychedelics in a much more reverent fashion from here on out, and tread more lightly on my mind."
1933,HBW Revisited with Amazing Results,Anonymous,"Jun 19, 2000",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Some of you may remember that I posted a description of a rather ho-hum Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seed (HBWS) trip a couple of weeks ago. Last night, a friend and I decided to make another attempt, with an increased dose, though aware of the warning that      \'high dosages are not advisable -- beyond a certain level, experience so far has shown a tendency for limbs to get bluish\'  -- Psychedelics Encyclopedia      I soaked twenty seeds in hot tap water for two to three hours, then (despairing of ever finding a mortar & pestle) smashed the seeds to a pulp with needle- nose pliers and added more water to the seeds & water in a tupperware container. I then vigorously shook the container. The water (strangely, since the seeds are brown & white) turned pond-scum green, with lots of seed chunks settling to the bottom.    I poured this mixture into two glasses, being careful to add the same proportion of pond-scum-water:seed-chunks to both glasses. My friend downed the mixture in one big gulp, getting some more water to wash some of the seed chunks from the side of the glass. I took it much more slowly, and returned for water a couple more times so I could get the seed chunks down.    My friend and I are both tall, thin men in our twenties. I\'m about 6\'2\', he\'s perhaps an inch or two taller. I weigh about 170 lbs, he is probably in that area -- maybe 10-20 pounds more. I say this for dosage reasons. We\'re tall fellows -- if you\'re 5\'6\' and weigh 130, you probably won\'t need as many seeds. (Note of warning: If you\'re pregnant, or think you might be, don\'t use HBWS or other ergot-type hallucinogens unless you know /exactly/ what you are doing. These drugs can cause uterine contractions and may cause miscarriage)    To cut to the chase -- the trip was a \'10\' for both of us. We\'ve both experienced many LSD trips, and between the two of us have sampled the delights of MDMA and psilocin/cybin. The HBWS trip ranked up there with the best.    It started soon but with a long slope. As an illustration, an LSD trip might be described like:                      ^_                 /  --___                /        ----_____               /                  ------_______              /                                --------_________  - t ------------|-------------------------------------------------------               30 min.      with a quick peak that\'s very intense, and then several hours of slowly returning to consensus reality. The HBWS trip was more like:                                    __-____                         ____---       -----______              ______-----                         -------________  - t ----------------------------|---------------------------------------                               3 hours      Also, the peak was much less intense. Overall, much much less visual and audio and other sensory hallucinations than with LSD. Visuals were mostly forced for diagnostic reasons, audio was great, but not LSD-profound.    But the mind-food -- the intellectual games -- were amazingly good. And the real bonus is that conversation is very easy (on LSD, I often find that I get lost in that enormous jungle of symbols between the beginning of a sentence and it\'s terminating punctuation mark, making linguistic communication with other people a real chore at times). I could talk and form sentences and such with no more difficulty than usual (and in fact, I felt that my ability to do so was even heightened -- my friend commented at one point that \'I have an idea, and the words just /come/! It\'s incredible!\'), but I had much more to talk about than usual.    Based on my previous experience, we expected a short trip with little mind- blowing. We took the brew at about 7:00PM and were up until 4:30AM talking almost non-stop metaphysics with two other people who were completely sober. I\'m still feeling the effects now, at about 11:00AM. At 4:30 I settled down to sleep and was pleasantly surprised to find that sleep came easily and that the sleep was deep and very satisfying. (On LSD, I find it very difficult to get to sleep until I have come way down from the trip).    If you enjoy LSD, I strongly urge you to give this stuff a try. \'...of the jungle\' sells HBWS at 11 seeds for $2.50, or 100 for $10.00. T.A.E. sells \'em at $25 per 1/2 oz., $40/oz., $110/4oz. and $450/lb. If the ones you get are crusty on the outside, like maybe the inside of a walnut shell, you should crack this pod open and just use the smooth seed inside. I suspect that the outer coating is what causes nausea in some people."
91515,"Exhausting, but Not Unpleasant",30secondstoawesome,"Jan 25, 2022",H.B. Woodrose,"Interesting First Experience    Previous experience: Psilocybin mushrooms: 9 times; LSD (low level): 2 times; 2C-B: 1 time; mescaline: 1 time; various other concoctions that were less memorable.    Ground up 5 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, soaked in distilled water for 24 hours, passed through shirt to try to filter excess material out, drank and tasted fine.  +35 minutes: some pleasant tingling/weirdness in head, slight body high, some not-unfamiliar feelings.  +45 minutes: about the same, but ground up more seeds in case first dose doesnt work.  +1 hour: Definitely feeling something now, not debatable.  Enjoying light, plants outside, dancing to music, definite non-alcohol related energy.  Mild stomach issues.  Eyes appear dilated somewhat.    +1 hour 30 min: Feeling a tingling in the hair, familiar from other drugs.  Though slow, and making me want to take more. Heading to river to smoke a bowl, cigarettes. Enjoy getting out of house, increasing external stimuli, seems to have woken the drug up a bit.  Fascinated by river, and touching rocks, tactile sensations are more enjoyable. Cant stop touching rocks. Mind wandering, hard to record thoughts on voice recorder. Want to smoke bowl but dont want to adulterate experience. Want to have the LSA experience on its own. Watching bird intently for time period, very cool. Starting to rain slightly.    +2 hours, 30 min: Smoked bowl, drank a beer. Energy very much increased, weird overall feeling. Wanted more, so took ones I ground up just a few hours before.   +3 hours, 30 min: Reading other experiences, amazing that I can read and focus so well. Very pleasant, nervous system going haywire, desire to lay down and listen to music.  +5 hours: Smoked more weed, but weed doesnt seem to affect me in a noticeable way like usual.  Im still very functional, reading articles online. Mild visuals in darkness with music, but very minimal.  Still stunned by energy.  +6 hours?: Cross-over to full tripping experience, but short-lived.    Summary: Pleasant overall, warnings about stomach ailments were overblown, I had some mild nausea but nothing noteworthy.  Visuals were minimal and time duration was minimal, these were disappointing.  May need higher dose in future experimentation.  Although there were moments that reminded me of previous psychedelic experiences.  Notable moment: in bathroom staring at floor with speckled design, started to move in organized fashion and I eventually lost myself briefly to visual stimuli, but very enjoyable.    All in all, exhausting, but not unpleasant, worthy of further experimentation at higher doses to see what may be possible with this substance."
92827,Paced in Total Chaotic Abandon,Sgt. Buzzkill,"Sep 28, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"H.B. Woodrose Experience    My experience in psychoactive substances is extensive and quite broad.  Prior to this experience I have used LSD between 200-300 times, Pscilocybin cubensis mushrooms 50+ times, MDMA 100+ times, as well as most other stimulants, depressants, and hallucinogens that are commonly available.      Purchased the seeds from a local head-shop that sells 1 gram packages for $25.  The package contained 8 seeds.      After reading several reports I decided to go with the sublingual method of preparation.  Using a nail-clipper to cut the seeds, I made each seed into 4 smaller pieces and then soaked in a couple of teaspoons of hot water.  I\'ll be honest, I wasn\'t expecting much from this.  I have read both positive and negative reviews on LSA and so I wasn\'t quite sure what to expect.     I ingested the seeds on an empty stomach and ended up swallowing about 4 of the chopped-up-seeds after allowing the mixture to sit in my mouth for about 10 minutes.  I should not have swallowed any of the seeds because after about an hour I became quite nauseous.  However I was beginning to get intense fractals in the light-patterns of my various lamps throughout my apartment.      After about 2 hours I sat down and smoked a bowl of Blueberry.  This seemed to kick the seeds into high-gear.  For several hours I paced throughout the house in total chaotic abandon and smoked cigarettes repeatedly.  I could not focus on anything, even the television, for more than a few seconds.      I went outside to go for a swim and upon diving into the water I felt as if I had actually dived into the celestial realm where no gravity exists.  It was really quite amazing.  The lights around the pool shined against the fence around the backyard of my house and it appeared as if I were actually swimming inside the moat of my medieval castle. As the bats would periodically swing low for a bite to eat, they appeared as strange dinosaur-like demons hunting for whatever soul they could feed upon.  After several minutes of confusion I managed to get out of the pool and dry myself off.  Making it back to my house was quite a feat.  Although the house was only about 30 feet away it took an intense amount of concentration to get my hands to open the sliding-glass door.      After laying on my couch and watching several hours of hilariously stupid episodes of Southpark, I finally managed to fall asleep.  The experience was quite fun.  Not as fun as LSD or schrooms, but quite comparable in some ways.  I will definitely repeat."
16305,Delerium Revisted,Shibby,"Jul 28, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I was familiar with the effects of woodrose and have used it twice before. None of the trips were as strong as this one. My past drug of choice was Datura and allergy medicines. I loved deliriants because it would be like living in a dream. That\'s far behind me, but last night I could only describe my experience as delirium revisited.      My friend Josh dosed up on eighteen seeds that I gave him at his house. Back at my house I ingested eleven for my first dose. I smoked a bowl and surfed looking at experiences. After about an hour or so I began to feel very warm and numb around my lips. My legs felt sore and everything stood out brightly. An hour and a half in I decided to take six more searching for acid visuals. I put on the Royal Teneanbaums and tripped throughout the movie. I didn\'t even feel like it was a comedy. I felt sympathy for the depressed adopted daughter, the angry son, the drug addict friend, and the isolated father. When the movie was over I ate another 4 putting me at twenty one seeds. I called up Josh and asked if he wanted to meet up. Even though we lived very far away from each other we met up by my house to eat more seeds. I ate five more leaving me at twenty six.    During the walk I was chain smoking cigarettes because they seemed to up my high each time I smoked. I was thinking about a lot of things on the way which I don\'t really remember, but I do recollect thinking about running away from my parents house to live in nature. I arrived at my old middle school where Josh showed up. At the time I was seeing things bending and grow. Definitely similar to Acid except more of a depressant effect. Sitting there my Josh showed up and we went outside a teachers room to smoke some pot. The pot just made everything more clear visually and all the poles holding the roof up began to shrink. We continued to smoke about .5 of a gram and save the rest for if we got to the roof of the school. Josh is a very immature person and decided to start trashing the area around us. There were two bushes and one clump of sage plants. I was crawling through the bushes, but it seemed like there were at least four that I went through. I then proceeded to collapse on the sage bushes. I engulfed my self in the crushed stems and leaves. I could feel bugs scattering all over my body.    I closed my eyes and when into a different world. I would feel like half of my body was above the other half. I was hearing weird music like I\'d hear from the Alien craft part of the movie fire in the skies. Also I would always hear someone say some gibberish then in a plain voice say, \'and then some.\' I wasn\'t sure what was going on, but I ate four more seeds putting me at thirty. I got up and rode Josh\'s bike he brought over. We went searching through the school for basketballs, toys, anything entertaining. I eventually got really cold and it was about one A.M.    I brought my self to the special ed wing and sat down and cried. I couldn\'t find Josh anywhere, but I\'d hear him tell me where he was, but I couldn\'t seem him. Every time I looked around he\'d appear then disappear. I wasn\'t quite sure if I was spinning in circles or turning left then right and not seeing him. Finally I located him. We walked out of the school. As we were leaving we had lost my cigarettes, hat, and belt. We were on our way to my house when I got an insane idea of going in some random guy\'s car and sleeping. My friend told me he wouldn\'t sit around and wait to get arrested. Finally his better judgement was gone and we began toking up in some random guy\'s car. I ate three more seeds in order to maintain this trip. I was still going in and out of the collapsing state I described. After about a half hour of being in this guys car the last set of seeds kicked in and I looked at my self in the mirror. I looked nuts, my pupils covered my irises and I reminded my self of an ant or Mickey Mouse. I lost perception of time as it began to overlapse and I could see what I thought was the future happen happen before my eyes. I started saying my home address in a repetitive fashion hoping maybe I was in the future and the car owner was driving us home. I finally got out of the car and rode my friend\'s bike home not knowing where I was going exactly just following a basic instinct.     I had forgotten now my seeds and my friend\'s weed in the car too. Dropping the bike, I ran up my hill and arrived home around three o\'clock at night. The next morning (today) I was extremely hung-over. It was a slow, slurring the speech DXM kind of hang-over.    My friend didn\'t end up spending the night and arrived home biking at 6:30. Just to show its A VERY BAD IDEA TO DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHEDELICS my friend fell over three times in the middle of the road. Thank god no cars were around or cops.      Excuse my spelling I\'m still kind of out of it. If your thinking of tryinga trip past what I\'ve read as the record of eighteen then eat them all at once and don\'t space them out unless you want a realy bad hang-over. -->"

Woodrose,"My friend had bought the seeds from a local store (a store like lowes), and had been taking them a few times before I tried it, with mild effects. <!-- He even came on here to show me a dosage.-->     I took nine, because it didnt kick in for an hour or more. I experienced the normal vomiting experience, until I got home and I tried to sleep and something told me there was something very wrong, my stomach felt worse than I had ever experienced, and I was having alot of trouble breathing.    I went outside and the next thing I know I went into a deep bad trip, the world was closing in on itself, the cul de sac I was in closed up, there was no outlet and I lost all conception of time and place. The world was a dark horrible place and I was laying in a gutter and I didnt know where I was. Friends came to my aid and after a while I seemed alot better, they talked me down and my stomach felt better after they made me vomit about 5 times. They stayed for about 2 hours, then I seemed ok to go home.    I got into my room and then my breathing would quit altogether. I would start to fall asleep and next thing I knew I would be gasping for air. It got to a point where I couldnt breathe normally at all. My heartbeat was really faint, and I would have to fight to stay awake cuz every time I relaxed at all I would stop breathing.    It lasted all night. I would experience a adrenaline jolt over and over, gasping at the same time. Even in the morning my breathing was labored, but at that time the good side of the seeds were kicking in, even though I couldn\'t breathe the world was bright and happy and  it was the best and worst experience I ever had it was the best and worst experience I ever had. Without taking those seeds and getting sick there were problems that would have never gotten resolved. I felt this renewed sense of self, my life at that point had been very tumultuous but when I took the seeds and had that experience it showed me alot of things didnt matter.    <!-- My cousin has a theory that since they were bought at a store like lowes, it was coated in poison, unlike when you buy them somewhere online... Be sure to take just a little the first time to see, or else ask an experienced person about it. -->I was not only experiencing poisoning but I took too much and I had a bad trip triggered from the poisoning.  <!-- So be careful with those seeds, even though they say they are milder than mushrooms, they have their own wild ride in themselves.-->"

The experiences that I had while on this trip were like no other that I\'ve ever experienced before. My mind wandered in ways that I never even thought possible.     So, what can I say about HBWR seeds? Take the time to prep them. Soak in cold distilled water for 15 minutes. After that, if you have decent thumb nails, you can scrape the outer ""fuzz"" off of them easily. After you do this, take a very sharp razor blade and then take the outer shell off. It\'s quite easy, place the seed on a hard surface and hold the razor blade to where you can just shave off the outermost edge of the seed. Do both sides on top, flip the seed, repeat on the other side. Then the rest of the shell can be flaked off with your fingernail. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes per seed if you\'re careful. No matter how careful you are, though, you will not be able to remove all shell fragments, and you will also probably lose some inner seed fragments as well. Don\'t worry about having some shell left. I probably two seeds worth of shell fragments left in my whole batch. Dispose of the outer shell, you won\'t be needing them.    To ingest the seeds, chew them. They are slightly bitter, but not unpleasant, especially if I quickly follow with cold mint tea.  <!-- I\'ve read that contact with peppermint converts LSA to LSH. -->Based off of my previous experience ingesting 10 whole, crushed HBWR seeds, and other previous experiences with 500 (yes, 500) Ipomeca Violeca morning glory seeds, I can safely say the mint changed the experience for the better.     The muscle cramping during the trip, I\'m not sure if that was vasoconstriction or dehydration. It didn\'t feel like the vasoconstriction I\'ve experienced during other HBWR or morning glory trips. What was really weird, is that the muscle cramping was actually a pleasant addition to the experience.     ---- Everything above was written during the trip, and shortly thereafter. Below is my recollection, two months later. ---    This was one of the most surreal experiences I\'ve ever had, the HBWR allowed my mind to wander in ways I never thought possible. Looking back on what I wrote, I do seem to remember a lot of the trip. My eyes were closed most of the time but I remember seeing space. Galaxies, stars, planets. I remember seeing the pyramids, with planets perfectly aligned. I remember that this somehow opened a gateway, and the opening of this gateway is what will ultimately save our future as humans. I remember at around the last update, the 2038 one, I completely lost control and had no other choice but to lay there and let the trip take me where it wanted until I eventually fell asleep. The entirety of this trip was extremely pleasant even with the cramping and vasoconstriction."
75614,"Not Enjoyable, at All",ReBelli0n,"Feb 20, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"About a week ago I purchased some H.B. woodrose seeds from my local headshop.  I always read up on everything prior to trying it out, and after reading about these, I decided 8 seeds for $10 was a great deal for a test.      I took 5 seeds immediately after I got home.  I popped them in my mouth, chewed them up real good, and swallowed them.  I had an empty stomach.  I sat down to watch the movie 10,000 B.C.  I watched the entire movie with no effects, aside from nausea.  I felt like if I moved too much, I would vomit.  So I just laid around.  I took the last 3 seeds the same way, right after the movie.  About an hour later, still no effects (going on nearly 3 hours now) I was hungry, so I ate an ice cream cone.  As soon as I was done eating, I was tripping HARD!  The trip itself is very hard to describe, because I can\'t find words to say it.  Details of everything stuck out at me.  I stared at a pill for about 20 minutes, reading the inscription on it, breaking it and looking at all the different shapes and designs of the \'crumbs.\'  I was extremely exhausted, so I decided to go to bed.  Bad idea...  My whole body was tingly, and each movement sent shivers through my entire body.  Huge waves of shivers.  My thoughts were very deep, and I felt a unique intuition to my own consience.  I laid in bed, exhausted, but unable to sleep because my mind was moving way too fast.  I had feelings of being inside my own body, inside my heart as it was pumping blood.  Somehow I eventually fell asleep, probably some time around 4-5 a.m.  I woke periodically, still tripping, about every 2 hours.  I finally woke up for good around 1:30 p.m.  Completely exhausted, and somewhat hung-over.  Still tripping somewhat as well.  My last dose of seeds was at about 9 p.m.  So well beyond the 12 hours suggested.  I made the best of my day, feeling sluggish, and still feeling waves of nausea and euphoria about once an hour.  Not something I really enjoyed, and definitely not something I\'ll take again."
24456,Bad Times,Jbwitchdance,"Jan 24, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"Just this past weekend I had my last experience with HBW.    I have taken the seeds twice before and rather enjoyed the trip but something went horribly wrong. After having dinner and a few drinks (I have drank with these before) I decided to take HBW thinking it might be interesting to be out and about whilst tripping. I was in a public place at the time so I couldn\'t really sand the fuzzy rough surface off. I proceeded to throw all seven in my mouth and chew them as throughly as one could. I had expected to feel nauseous for a little while but once it started at around 10:30 pm it didn\'t stop, I was however in good spirits and was feeling a slight trip take hold.     Myself and a few others went out to a cafe and I was still fighting back the urge to be sick when we decided to call it a night at around 1 am. My Boyfriend and I went home and I layed down hoping to sleep it off. I was wrong.    About an hour after I feel asleep I woke up very very sick and also tripping beyond my comprehension. I made my way into the loo in the hope I would get rid of whatever I needed to. I was very cold yet sweating horribly and my pupils were extremely dilated.    I had to crawl from the bathroom floor to the bedroom to try to wake my partner but it seemed to take years and once there I was in tears and couldn\'t get the words out to let him know I needed some help. After maybe fifteen minutes I managed to wake him and we sat in the bathroom till I forced myself to be sick.      I was sick several times that night and could not sleep as well as having the impending sence I was going to die. No matter how many time I was sick the nauseous feeling would not go away and I took to pacing the room till around 8am the next day. While the trip could have been good,the sickness and thoughts ruined the whole thing for me."
115068,"Not Quite a Trip, but Still Pleasant",Goh,"Jan 20, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"Mildly experienced psych user, but by no means veteran. It was my first LSA experience so I started low.    11:55 AM: 5 hits of liquid LSA equivalent to 12.5 seeds (assuming a perfect extraction via Kash\'s method, which of course no extraction is perfect but, just for reference) were placed on a sugar cube then left under the tongue to dissolve. ""Mild apprehension, blank dreams of the coming fun.""    12:08 PM: Dabbed some hash oil, morning coffee. So far I\'m only feeling the dab. Maybe a bit of ""unsteady hands"" like I get before LSD kicks in.    12:15 PM: Feeling something for sure. That subtle shakiness in my jaw and other joints. Feels like something getting ready to kick in. Maybe just in my head?    12:32 PM: Things are looking more vibrant, maybe slight breathing. Mild difficulty typing, have to keep deleting occasional wrong letters, dabs won\'t do that to me but I may just be tired. No pupil dilation.    12:50 PM: I feel good. No nausea. Colors are vibrant and I\'m feeling a bit cold but that might just be winter with the window open. No visuals yet. Listening to MGMT with iTunes visualizer. Quarantine trips feel like high school.    12:57 PM: Extremely subtle breathing in ""cottage cheese ceiling,"" the psychonaut\'s best friend.    1:02 PM: Another dab and Shakedown Street. I feel better than I\'d feel after this many dabs normally. Ceiling breathing becoming a bit more evident but still very subtle. No nausea and, if there is any sedation, it\'s very mild.    1:30 PM: Doesn\'t feel like I\'m coming up any more than this, and LSD peaks around 2 hours? if I recall correctly, so that should be about right. This felt like somewhere in-between a microdose and an actual dose. It felt good but I do wish it had been stronger, only because I\'ll now need to wait 8 days to experience it more in-depth. I\'m all for waiting a bit after a trip, but I wouldn\'t call this quite a ""trip."" Nonetheless a very good experience. Just got in from tending to cactus and cannabis garden so that speaks to how little sedation / unpleasant or noticeable vasoconstriction there was. I\'m still feeling it but I\'ll basically be able to go about my day like normal, with a bit more appreciation for music and colors. I\'d probably have been fine to drive this whole time but will avoid it for the next few hours just to be safe.    3:00 PM: Everything is still a little vivid and everything is really interesting, but never reached that level of tripping.     It tapered off from there, with nothing noticeable to report for the remainder of the afternoon. It felt really nice, almost like an edible where I don\'t realize how good it feels until wears off."
12154,Chillin With the HBWs,Nug Lovin\',"Jan 17, 2021",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"Ok, this report is from one of the Koops Rakoons Clan, from the South Side. I will identify myself as Nug Luvin. So here\'s the deal:    Ok, my brother and his friend ordered 200 seeds off the internet from a guy in Honolulu. They\'ve purchased from him before, and liked what they got, so they decided to get a bigger shipment. So Ive only tried them twice, taking 5 seeds both times. Ill write about both my experiences here. The first time, about a week ago,  I was chilling at Stuie\'s house with him and Mishap and Wakenshakenbake when me and Wake decided to try some. We had smoked a good amount of herb earlier so we were pretty baked but I wanted to what they were like. Wakenshakenbake decided to take 8 and we started preparing them.     We scraped off the outer layer and got the seeds pretty smooth with the help of a rapidly spinning little brush with tiny bristles on it. We crushed them up so they were pretty soft, and ate em. I chewed mine pretty good, and made sure I got all the little bits in my stomach. So we decided to get on the computer and fuck around til the effects start taking place. Wake took them at about 10:00 and I took them about a half hour after that.    I don\'t really know what happened in that time period, but about 45 mins later, it hit me. I knew the exact moment when they started taking affect and it was amazing. I could tell instantly what was going on. I was very alert, and everything seemed so clear. I knew right away that I was going to enjoy doing them in the future very much and I really just had fun. Everything stood out and was so clear, and definite. It was a lot different than just smoking a lot of weed Everything stood out and was so clear, and definite. It was a lot different than just smoking a lot of weed, when I don\'t really know what\'s going on and everything\'s blurry and stuff. But on these, everything is easy to understand and see and its a truly unexplainable feeling. So I decided to start out my trip by just playing some video games. It was fun as hell, even though I sucked really bad, but I was just so happy, nothing mattered. If someone told me that I was going to die in 5 mins, I would\'ve just sat there and laughed. I was happy. It was great.   So next, me and Wake decided to check out some cool stuff on the internet. We started with one of our favorite sites, www.elftrance.com and watched our favorite video, Evolution. Monkeys tripping on mushrooms and anal probe-planting have never been so funny. It was great and the music accompanying it definitely enhanced my experience.   -->  After that, we sat back and listened to some Bob Marley and Jamiroquai while checking out some trippy visualizations. The colors kept changing into amazing patterns and the little lines were forming shapes and images I had never seen before. I slowly slipped into a trance where all I could do was sit there and listen to the music and think. I was think about how great everything is, giving thanks to everything that was helping me have this great experience. All 4 of us decided then to go smoke another bowl, so we went outside and up into The Dragons Lair. I didnt really know what was happening, but I just took quite a few hits and then went back inside. I decided to lie down, so I wandered into Stuies room.    I fell, sprawled out onto his bed and closed my eyes. I was flying and talking to all my friend in my mind. Everyone was happy and everything was perfect, it couldnt be any better. So I dont know when, but I fell asleep probably around 12:30.    The next morning, I woke up in a daze. I stared at the closet and tried to figure out where I was. Oh shit, I had fallen asleep in Stuies bed. My bad. I had to piss really bad, so I stumbled into the bathroom, put my pants around my ankles like a 2nd grader, and tried to focus on what was going on. My eyes couldnt fix on any one point and I slowly lost all my senses. I couldnt see, think, or hear anything, so I fell on the floor. I lay there for about two minutes before I realized what was happening. I talked to myself in my head, Dude! What are you doing? Get up and put your pants on dude! Come one, get a hold of yourself! So I splashed some cold water on my face and walked into the other room, finding Stuie and Wake sleeping on the couch. I apologized for stealing his place of rest and we sat around trying to piece together what had happened last night. There were cookie crumbs everywhere and it was a complete mess.     Even in the morning, I was still feeling the effects pretty strongly, and I told myself in my mind that everything was alright, so I just put a smile on my face and chilled out. So me and Mishap left Stuies at about 10:30 and I was still feeling it the next day until about noon or 1:00. Overall, I had a great time and was anxious to do them again sometime.    So in another few days, I got my chance. Heres the deal:    It was us same 4 guys chilling together again, this time, at me and Mishaps house. We decided this night would be a fairly good time for a trip, so me and Stuie decided on 5 each, with Wakenshakenbake taking 8 (again), and Mishap eating 7. It is always a bitch to prepare them, but we found a good system.<!--  that I will share with all of you --> Stuie started rubbing the seeds on the real scratchy side of some velcro, and the coating started coming right off. We scrape them until they were perfectly smooth, and this didnt take too long with Stuies new invention. Then, we dumped all of our assigned seeds into a pepper grinder that Mishap stole from my mom. They were ground up pretty finely and we dumped them into empty gel caps that Stuie got from his parents. We all decided on an activity to do until we started tripping, so we got out drawing pads and start sketching funny stuff.    Stuie was drawing crazy things that make your mind go insane, Wake was making fake commercials for the Koops Rakoons, and I started on a comic strip of our experience that night. It didnt take too long for us to start feeling them, since they were ground so finely and all of our drawing were just silly stupid stuff, but we thought it was pretty damn cool. It honestly was funny as hell. We were just having conversations about stuff that most people talk about on psychedelics. Everyone was in a very mental mood and we had some pretty intriguing ideas and conversation was definitely a good thing to do at the time.    Mishap was sort of feeling sick to his stomach, so we decided to go smoke a lil weed, so we finished off a little nug and some shake that Mishap had. It is weird being high on two totally different plants at the same time because they are both totally different kinds of high. However, I think it is better that way because I can still have an awesome time with HBWs and just chill out and being stupid/silly from the weed.  Mishap started feeling better, I was feeling great, along with Stuie, but Wake had some bad stomach cramps. It is probably mostly to blame on the HBWs, but we were all also eating massive amounts of munchies so that might be part of it too.    I decided to try and meditate, since I have done it before, so I got comfortable on Mishaps bed and put on some music, a mix of trippy relaxing dub and some smooth techno music. It was hard to concentrate on one thing, but I finally could focus enough that I was convinced that I was swimming through fields and fields of lush green vegetation. I was surrounded by nature, mostly by flourishing plants and bushes, but some wildlife too. Weird animals ran through the huge forests and I just kept swimming along in my mind, without a care in the world. After awhile, I got bored, so I joined the other guys in the next room.    After a little while of playing some Nintendo (and sucking horribly), I started to get a headache, so I went to bed. <!-- The other guys stayed up for awhile, even though Stuie and Mishap were waking up early the next morning to go snowboarding, but they just played Nintendo for a while. I didnt see Stuie or Mishap in the morning, so I didnt know what they were feeling, but Wake and me woke up at about 9. --> When I first got out of bed, it was similar to what happened before at Stuies: I couldnt really focus, and I almost lost control of all my senses again. <!-- I regained control of the situation and wandered into the room where Wake was sleepin.     He told me had thrown up last night, at about 3 in the morning, which seemed strange to me. Besides a little head ache, I experienced no nausea or cramps, but still, Wake said he was feeling pretty shitty last night and not too good this morning either. We got up and had some breakfast, and we had a problem. He had to be home in about 45 minutes, but he had no ride, and there was no way we were walking or riding bikes in the snow. We had some pretty crazy ass ideas, which I wont mention right now, but when I look back at it, its pretty funny because we were pretty messed up still, and we didnt even realize it. But everything turned out and I decided to chill for a while.  -->I felt the effects till about 1:30 in the afternoon and I enjoyed the whole day very much.   Well, thats the end of my stories so far on HBWs, but look for other reports from the Koops Rakoons Clan coming soon. If I have anything to say about HBWs, I would say that you should make sure to scrape all of the coating off them before you consume them. You should try out our methods of preparation and consumption, because they work fairly well and they are pretty easy. Also, I would recommend for first timers to take a fairly small dose, maybe 5-8 seeds, and see if you like it the first few time before you move up to 10 or 12. I also recommend to surround yourself with things that will enhance the experience (cool music, movies, visualizations, etc.) and it is fun to hold deep conversations with some of your good friends, its interesting to see what ideas come up. Well, Im out so peace forever from the KRs, and remember our motto, Be Happy.   -->"
100184,Good  for Emotional Trauma and Cuddling,Whatissleep,"Nov 25, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"My fiance and I had been looking for hallucinogens to help with her fibromyalgia as well as both of us having PTSD due to the death of our daughter. Due the lack of availability of any substances such as mushrooms or LSD, we looked into natural hallucinogens such as morning glories and Hawaiian baby woodrose and ordered bags of both. The HBWR was the first to arrive and we consumed them after about 2-3 minutes of boiling just in case of treatment.     I gave my fiance about 6 and ate about 6-7 myself. Not really sure as I was quite distracted by conversation with a friend. We had read lots of online stories that usually resulted in stomach troubles so we kept her Reglan (Nausea medication) and Tums handy.    After about 15 minutes or so we both started noticing \'tracers\' out of our peripherals. Colors would blur outside of our direct line of visions and we repeatedly thought we saw our cat\'s eyes in our peripherals as well. There was some serious cramping in my legs. Colors were very interesting however. Flat colors would develop patterns that danced. (Adventure Time was quite amusing.) There was a head tingle that reminded me of taking boxes of cold medicine back in my younger days.    We decided to lay in bed as cuddling on the couch revealed that touch gave a rather interesting sensation. We didn\'t make love as the sensations made certain it hard to become erect (no pun intended) but we did strip naked and cuddle tightly which gave off quite a euphoric sensation. She said it compared to ecstasy, which I had never tried.     When the physical sensations started to slightly pass, my mental state was zen to say in the least. There was loose word association in my conversations and everything around me in my room had an odd, comfortable yet unfamiliar feel to it. There\'s a feeling afterward that everything was right with my head. I felt so emotionally euphoric it made me almost teary.    The next day, I felt slight cramping in my leg at first but a little stretching made it feel much better. My mental state felt better than it had in months. Next time, I plan to take more and hope for a more psychedelic trip.     OVERALL ANALYSIS: Perfect for lovers or very zen people. Conversation is a must. And it\'s better to trip with someone because I became very self-conscious and loose association with thoughts and ideas could lead to a bad trip if I were to make it a pity party. NO negative energies around to have a pleasant trip."
69450,"An Annoyance, Not an Experience",Mounthawk Boy,"Oct 22, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Wine,"One night after the nightclub, we (me E, P and S) got a phone call from some of my friends who lived near us on our university campus, asking us to call over as they were also returning from a night out and were bored. I am quite drunk at this point, having drunk 2 bottles of 14% proof white wine (local shop sold 5 bottles for 20 euros, live in Ireland). One of them had been talking about these seeds (now know them to be HBW) he had procured from a legal drugs store for some time before this, and when I arrived offered me 20, saying he had a good trip off them, but 2 bad ones. I accepted them, and drunkenly tried to remove the outer layer, as he instructed. Managing one, I get bored and eat 8, giving E 7 seeds and P 5.    We hung round here for an hour, drinking a few cans of lager and E wants to leave. We soon see why as he steps outside the door he pukes up the seeds. How I envied him the next day.    Went to my friends house for half an hour, before returning to my own flat next door complaining I felt nothing exept a bit sick off of those shitty seeds, and was tired. I fell asleep around 4am, about 20 mins after I left my friends house. I still felt slight nausea, but not enough to stop me from conking out.    Around 5:30 am I woke up bolt upright, with my head feeling strange, and the room misty and wierd. I was incredibly dehydrated and was experiencing wierd colour trails emanating off of my hands when they moved. It was nothing major, but reasonably interesting. The nausea had returned with a vengeance and I knew there was no chance of returning to sleep.    At this point I put on some music and it was very, very good. I remember laughing at how perfect and tuneful it was, appreciating the smallest harmony as something unbelievably complex. This 20 mins was the only good part of the experience.    The nausea swelled and dropped almost like waves, annoying and uncomfortable and I quickly became exhausted, yet absolutely unable to sleep. Music was also no longer fun, and I was INCREDIBLY uncomfortable, fidgeting and shifting around horribly in my bed, way too hot and way too cold simultaneously. For some reason I wouldnt leave the room (I dont know why this is, I didnt even think of it) so I sat there suffering with intense dehydration also.    Around 8am the nausea was at its peak, so I crawled to the toilet, heaving up a thick, porridge-like material with great difficulty for about 15 mins. I also drank from the bathroom tap. (sooo thirsty, dear god). On crawling back, I passed the mirror and looked at myself. I was naked because of my crazy temperature, and my body, usually skinny but toned, looked skeletal and disgusting, almost anorexic. I was repulsed by my appearance, and this was a wierd experience, usually love myself ;-P... Could finally sleep though.    Woke up the next day feeling like I had been severely beaten up, and then slept on a bag of rusty horseshoes. My pupils were heavily dilated and messed up, I looked like shit and felt depressed  and strangely sickened with myself. P, who had not vomited, had experienced the same as me to a lesser extent, and agreed they were a piece of shit as he also shared the after effects. I think the nausea was probably heightened by the poor removal of material and my heavy drunkenness, but my opinion is still that they are a waste of time<!-- , go the whole hog and get some ecstasy or lsd for christ sake-->."
114860,Death and Rebirth in the Bathtub,KLB,"Oct 19, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I experienced the effects of LSA on two separate occasions within the same week in 2017 while on holiday from college. I had purchased Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seeds and ingested 4 seeds by chewing and holding the seeds under my tongue for several minutes. The vasoconstrictive and nauseating came on first within about half an hour and intensified until the peak of the experience. Notably, the experience was one of confusion and visual distortion that made light almost too intense to bear. I spent the better part of this experience tending to my nausea and feeling that I would purge. No purging occurred, likely because I did not swallow the seeds.     The second experience involved crushing the remaining seeds and soaking in naphthalene for a day. The solvent was evaporated and the dried residue was packed into gel capsules. I took the equivalent of 8 seeds worth of capsules and prepared for the experience. Nausea and vasoconstriction began rapidly and built in intensity until it reached an almost unbearable level. I had not eaten that day, so I repeatedly dry heaved until the sickness passed and my sense of reality faltered. I lay in the bathtub with a small amount of warm water to comfort myself. I had turned the lights off as well. I closed my eyes and felt a presence in the darkness. I saw a dark entity with wide brimmed hat that told me it was there to kill me in a matter-of-fact way that was reminiscent of a grim reaper late for his next appointment and wishing to finish me in short order. And kill me it did. I lost all sense of self and then for a time my consciousness seemed to be taken off the grid entirely. Someone had hit the off switch on my entire being and the idea of being itself. There was nothingness. This was death.     I am not sure how long I lay there, but eventually my faculties came back online, one-by-one. First came the sense of touch and then the sensation of movement. I writhed around unaware of who or what I was. I became increasing body conscious and was able to just breathe and allow my brain to come back online. I was first aware of being alive, then of being human, then of being capable of language, then of being ME. I had returned to sober reality just as suddenly as I had left, but I will never forget this experience. I was shown what it felt like to die and how it felt to be reborn."
92387,A Moment of Peace,clatatat,"Oct 11, 2020","H.B. Woodrose, Aripiprazole & Alprazolam","I had been taking Abilify earlier in the morning for about two weeks. I included it because some have suggested it can interfere with tripping; I have never noticed much of a difference.     I got home around ten and my brother offered me some seeds. He had ten and wanted to give me half, but I have a sensitivity and have been tripping about once a week for a few weeks so I just took two. The first one I swallowed, like a pill. He was chewing on his and said it seemed to work better so he gave me another and I chewed it. I took it with half of a 0.25 Xanax, which I am prescribed for anxiety (0.5/day). After a half hour we went outside so I could smoke a cigarette and we could smoke a bowl. Then we went our own separate ways to watch netflix, agreeing we would meet up again if we both started tripping.     An hour after this I begin to feel slightly up on it, my high sort of transitioned from weed to something else. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and while I never reached the point of tripping on it things shook gently when I was not looking at them especially the wallpaper in the kitchen and the floors. Sitting out there was euphoric almost, but I was really exhausted so when I went back inside I fell asleep and probably missed most of it. As I was falling asleep I felt so happy, so relaxed, and a little out of my mind. I felt attached inwardly to some fixed ideal that seemed reasonable and justified and possible. It was the most peaceful moment I have had while just laying and thinking in the past six years."
75613,One Night in Heaven,Andrew,"Sep 22, 2020",Alcohol & H.B. Woodrose,"My friend T and I had been wondering about these seeds for a while, and finally one day we bought 50 from an internet headshop. This is how our evening went.    Basically the first thing we did was the general pre night in planning, where we ended up getting lost on a mountain for  four hours and then went to the local supermarket to buy several bottles of wine and a crate of beer. We headed back to Ts  house and started excitedly started to prepare the seeds, which out of our excitement was done in a very basic and crude way (although this works for me). We just wrapped each of our doses in tissue and put it in a bag, then crushed them with a hammer in the back garden, we then added them to two cups of water and let them stand for about 20 minutes. When the time came we both drained our murky green/brown mixture seeds an all, which in my opinion tastes revolting, but is WELL worth it J. We then sat in the living room watching a football match with Ts Dad, waiting for them to kick in, and drinking our various alcoholic drinks, feeling only mild stomach discomfort.    After about an hour and a half we started to finally feel the effects, and it happened so subtly that Im not quite sure of when or what happened when it did. What I do know is that we spent most of the night marvelling at how the seeds had altered our perception, we did a range of random activities that we wouldnt think of in any normal situation, other than playing the guitar a lot which is one of our favourite pastimes anyway. I distinctly remember at one point we were both in the kitchen and I decided to sort of run from one side to the other repeatedly bouncing off the walls, which I found to be extremely satisfying, and only extended the grin on my face.     Another thing that struck me about the amazing effect of these seeds, was my intense appreciation of nature Another thing that struck me about the amazing effect of these seeds, was my intense appreciation of nature, as once it had gone dark shortly after our kitchen fun, I had found one of those gel masks in the freezer that you wear to help with a hangover, and since it was bright blue put it on, then I went into the back garden (without telling anyone) and began to start wandering around. The garden seemed so much bigger than usual, there is a weeping willow tree there that hangs so low you have to duck to avoid the leaves, and I spent around an hour and a half blissfully wandering around it like it was a walk through a very peaceful wood, and by the time T had realised I wasnt inside with him, he came out to find me standing in a miniature patch of earth between his and his neighbours fences, I kept telling him how this tiny piece of land (about a foot wide and three feet long) was free and wasnt owned by anyone, unlike pretty much everything in society, needless to say I found it of great significance to me and really enjoyed the feeling of elation knowing I was standing in a free spot, which probably was owned by one or the other anyway.    After finally returning inside we decided to breakout the musical instrument, so we each got our guitars and started to play song after song, which being a happy thing to do usually was pure bliss in euphoria that night. Then I got another twinge of stomach ache  so I went to get a glass of water, I drank half of it down and suddenly started to taste blood, but being quite inebriated I was unable to locate the cause, so I kept drinking and tasting blood, the taste of blood was making my nausea even worse so I decided to stop and then eventually realised that the glass I was drinking from had a crack that had cut my lip very slightly, but the damage was done and the taste of blood set of a spiral of nausea which ended up with me vomiting. For about 3 minutes before I finally threw up. I felt terrible, then decided to allow the inevitable and went to the toilet, after I had finished I felt even better than I did before and my euphoria peaked tremendously.    We spent the rest of the night monged out on a sofa and a beanbag chair listening to extremely mellow music that I cant quite remember, and after about an hour of that went to bed at around 2-3 am. I found the camp bed EXTREMELY comfortable and fell asleep easily while watching the flickering light of the video player. The next day we got up after a good 12 hours of sleep and felt great, if not a little tired, but I must warn we did it again and got up at 7am the next day, which left me the most tired I have ever been in my life.    On summary, to me it was one of the best experiences of my life, and all since that has yielded the same results, I also found that the environment makes a huge difference to the results of the high, for me it was a peaceful and slightly unfamiliar place that gets the best from them.    <!-- Hope you enjoyed this review and I would highly recommend these seeds if you have a day or two free.-->"
89347,Heaven and Hell,Father Kesey,"Aug 7, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Ive been interested in psychadelic drugs for some time now, and have tried LSD, psilocybin and amanitas muscaria mushrooms, DXM, DHP, ketamine and salvia. So when the possibility of LSA seeds came up, I was eager and thought I knew what to expect\x85.    11:00 PM - I eat twelve Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds purchased from an online vendor. Im pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to chew them up and eat them, and compared to how dried mushrooms taste it is practically gourmet.     11:15 PM  Im beginning to feel nauseous, and I vomit a little. Im worried that Ive ruined the experience because I had only just eaten the seeds, but apparently the LSA was already absorbed.    11:30 PM  Im feeling worse than any drug has ever made me feel, with the possible exception of one time when I chugged two bottles of cough syrup for the DXM. Im feeling extremely nauseous and cannot move, and my mental state is quickly approaching the dreaded bad trip    12:00 AM  Im still feeling quite bad but Im beginning to feel better. My friend whos taken LSA seeds many times assures me Im about to feel amazing, but Im still distrustful. Ive completely lost my conception of time  it could have been five minutes or two hours.    12:15 AM  Im starting to feel warm and soft, and I sink into the couch Im sitting on. A sense of calm and spirituality is starting to steal over me, and Im forgetting the nausea that was so severe before    12:30 AM  The LSA is truly kicking in now, and I feel great. Im seeing movement in my visual field similar to LSD, though not as strong. Mostly I feel awesome, connected to the people Im with, and serene. It reminded me of the ego loss that occurs on MDMA as well as LSD.    1:00 AM  Walking home, I feel extremely close to the world. I run into some people I know and they fill me with an intense joy (again, like MDMA) and colors are vibrant as on other psychedelics. I go home and settle into a relaxing trip.    4:00 AM  the LSA is starting to wear off and I feel sleepy, not jittery like I do at the end of an acid trip. I drift off to sleep and the next morning there was no trace of a hangover. If anything, I felt an afterglow of peace and sociability that lasted the whole day.    Huxley said hallucinogens take us to either Heaven or Hell, but LSA took me to both. As beautiful as my trip ultimately was, I do not know if it was worth the hour or so of hell I went through to get there. The early part was as bad as the later part was good, and although the later part lasted much longer, the early part felt much longer.<!--In short, I recommend LSA to only those who truly love psychadelic drugs, because only then will the awesome effects be worth the rough come-up.-->"
89819,Lucky or Unlucky,Sprout,"Jul 2, 2020",Alcohol & H.B. Woodrose,"My first time using HBWR seeds I crushed and ingested 5 whole seeds; it was actually tremendous fun and highly euphoric/empathogenic. <!-- Perhaps you will be lucky enough to have such an experience. However, <!-- you might have an experience like -->my second and last time using these seeds...    I had been drunk all day, and as the evening drew on I thought it might be fun to get the giggles. I crushed and ingested 5 HBWR seeds. After waiting impatiently for a mere 30 minutes, I very unwisely ingested 2 more seeds. The psychedelic effect hit me hard and fast and I was soon lolling about laughing and seeing tracers and bits of color. I thought everything was fine. Unfortunately, about three hours into the trip, it started to get uncomfortably intense and I stupidly thought more alcohol would mellow me out. I drank a few more beers and became EXTREMELY sick. I vomited explosively and lost motor control. All I could do was lay on the ground, with gut-wrenching dry heaves every few minutes. I felt a sensation like corrosive acid flowing through my veins and I realized I had poisoned myself. I called out feebly for my wife. When she came I asked for my friend Tom to come over. For some reason I thought he could save me. My wife was frightened and I was unable to console her because damn it, I was scared too!    When my friend got there he found me incoherent and babbling so he practically carried me to the car and took me to the hospital. I remember feeling like it was too late; I was going to die a pathetic death. The waiting room at the hospital was full, but when I fell out of my chair and dry heaved I was admitted immediately. I was asked questions to determine my mental state and I guess they decided I was too wasted to be a threat to anyone. I told them what I had taken and they sort of shook there heads like there was nothing they could do but wait and flush out my system with intravenous fluids. I lay there for many hours. It was difficult to breathe, and difficult to think, and my heart kept skipping beats. The psychedelic effect had long since worn off. I was simply ill.    I finally went home at about 4 in the morning and took some melatonin to fall asleep. Thankfully, I woke up fine the next day. I have been tempted many times to ingest HBWR seeds again, but each time the memory of that experience fills me with dread and I refuse to eat those things. <!-- If you are desperate enough to try these things, scrape off the outer shell and DO NOT eat them while drinking! In fact, don\'t mix them with any other drugs. There is no need to. Trust me, if they work right, you won\'t need anything else in you. But from what I\'ve heard from other people, my second experience is much more common. So really you should not bother. Please be safe I really believe these seeds could kill a person!-->"
99618,Near Death,TheFeeling,"Jun 16, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Coffee,"Although I have used these seeds before, I have never had a worse experience with them than this time. Some parts were euphoric, but for the majority of it I believed that I was going to die.     At around eleven o\'clock at night I took eleven seeds which I had prepared by scraping the fur off the seeds, grinding them in a pepper grinder, and then putting them in water for around twelve hours. There were a few things I did differently this time, namely I had a coffee before I took them, I took one more than usual, and I soaked them for longer than usual, which may have had an effect on what happened.    For the first hour it was the usual lying in bed feeling like I couldn\'t move, watching videos on Youtube, feeling like I was euphorically happy. It had kicked in quicker than usual and I was virtually immobile for thirty minutes. When I looked in the mirror I could see that my pupils had become absolutely massive and I wandered around laughing about that for a while once I managed to stand up from my bed. Then the cigarette cravings got too much and I had to wonder outside to have a cigarette.    This is when things began to get bad, I smoked a cigarette and felt fine, looked around at the dark sky, and felt pretty happy. Then a friend of mine came out and I lit another one, they had realised I was off my face and seemed quite worried and I became extraordinarily paranoid about this. Suddenly I felt as if I were going to throw up, and had to run upstairs without finishing the cigarette.    I threw up in the loo without having to make myself about three times and I can\'t particularly remember much for about an hour, aside from the fact that I lay on the floor of the bathroom freaking out. Every once in a while I would get this rushing feeling in my head and a very harsh ringing sound which I could stop by sitting up. Once I could finally stop freaking out, I washed my hands, and marvelled at the water\'s feeling, but I was still scared that I was going to die. On that bathroom floor I honestly thought that I was dying, my heart was beating a million miles an hour and the ringing in my head freaked me out. One thing I notice looking back is that my sense of perception was completely warped and although the bathroom was tiny I felt like I was laying in a massive room.    Once I got back to my bedroom I found that I had a lot of energy, and I managed to draw a picture, leave a message to myself on my mobile, and write an entry in my diary. The picture itself was the typical crap that someone off their face would draw, all swervy lines and weird eyes and when I look at it seems to reflect how scared I was at that point. I then remember briefly listening to some music but my legs became restless and I begun to hallucinate more so than I already was, while usually lines become a bit weird, this time I begun to see shapes shift and things move. This was probably around three o\'clock.     I became more scared after listening to Pink Floyd and so at around three thirty I tried to get to sleep. But there was no way I was getting to sleep, firstly my legs were so restless and I had to keep on moving them, I was getting cigarette cravings that were physically painful, and when I closed my eyes I was seeing microwave ovens going on journeys. I basically couldn\'t move and I didn\'t get to sleep for a long time.    The next day I couldn\'t focus, and the lines on a page kept on moving around and the restless legs continued until the evening. Although I have had great experiences on these seeds, I found that this time I thought that I was dying. It might have been the coffee<!--  since these are technically a depressant and coffee is a stimulant-->, or that I skipped over the preparation too much, but whilst I felt enlightened and mildly euphoric I was also very scared and unable to do much more than lay down. Next time I would probably take no more than ten seeds and try to get to sleep before the restless legs set in."
99375,Took Long Time to Kick in but Worth It,TheFeeling,"Jun 16, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I took twelve of these seeds at about 11 o\'clock at night, I recently bought some from a shop and they had done nothing and so decided to get some off the internet. I took them by scrapping the fur off, chewing them, and then swishing them around in my mouth for around an hour; until my friend came into my room and I spat them out into the loo.    I was feeling alright at this moment, but nothing much had particularly happened, I went and had a cigarette before deciding to go to bed at 1 o\'clock. Still nothing had happened, aside from what I believed were placebo effects of feeling relaxed. It was at about 4 o\'clock in the morning when I woke up having to go to the loo very badly, and as I got up it felt as if my stomach muscles were tearing and it hurt to walk. When I finally managed to go back to bed I lay there almost paralysed for a while, just thinking. I think I had some closed eye visuals at the time, but I fell back asleep.    Waking up around 7 o\'clock I realised that the effects had not worn off, and I felt an inordinate amount of energy, when I got up I realised that my pupils were going crazy, and I went over to breakfast and grabbed an apple. Nature looked pretty amazing at this point, and I spent a while looking at the sky and the grass which just seemed enhanced and very interesting. I think I chucked the apple away without really eating it.     I had to go to a brief talk at around 9 o\'clock and then had a lecture afterwards. In the talk I plugged myself into my iPod and listen to Pink Floyd feeling completely at peace with myself, time went slowly and I noticed how the light was falling in the room. I was still completely high.    At the lecture I barely restrained myself from running out of the room, and spent most of it looking out the window. I felt like I wasn\'t able to talk and had a few strange visuals at this point. As soon as I was finished I literally ran back to my room, and went outside for a cigarette with a friend. My friend could see that something was up with me, and started freaking out slightly. I went into the nearest park and sat in it for about an hour and a half, I wasn\'t seeing many visuals but my thoughts seemed expanded and every sense was enhanced.    At about twelve I went to sleep for about two hours and woke up feeling more normal. I still felt a bit spacy for the whole day, and I didn\'t feel quite normal until a day afterwards. Nevertheless it was an enjoyable experience, but next time I would do them on a day when I don\'t have commitments and can sit and enjoy the world around me otherwise it kind of ruins the experience at bit. The only downside was that I felt quite sick, but this wore off and I didn\'t throw up. I did feel quite gassy however, and I burped quite a lot, but I am not sure whether that was related to the seeds."
106653,Temporary Reprieve From Crippling Depression,MikeyP,"Jun 2, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I have been diagnosed with treatment resistant major depressive disorder and have had significant flares of my illness around twice per year for the past six years. Having tried every class of antidepressant medication and only achieved a partial remission I decided to look into alternatives. After reading about an upcoming clinical trial of psychadelics in clinical depression and reaching the end of the road in terms of what my psychiatrist could offer, I decided that I had nothing left to lose by taking the plunge. I decided that I had nothing left to lose by taking the plunge.    My previous use of psychedelics was at least 10 years ago and was limited to psilocybin containing mushrooms. My past experiences were all very negative. I felt out of control and couldn\'t handle the introspection. These little seeds were very, very different.     I ordered 300 hbwr seeds online and put them away for a day when I had a good enough mindset to use them. Unfortunately, my mental health was in a downward spiral and I found myself actively planning my suicide. I thought about the seeds, and thought that if I was going to die anyway then I might as well try them. I was staying with my parents following a separation from my wife a few months earlier. Nobody else was aware of the seeds. Hardly an ideal set and setting!     At 15:00 I took 5 seeds. At first I planned on just eating them but when I put them in my mouth I couldn\'t stand the fuzzy texture so I decided to steep them in water for 10 minutes before rubbing most of the fuzz off with a dry cloth. I then chewed the seeds up for at least 5 minutes and then swallowed them down.    At T+0:20 I started to get a mild nausea which lasted for around 40 minutes then faded away. As the nausea disappeared I started to feel the first effects. I felt light and floaty, a little like I had smoked a little marijuana. My mood lifted slightly and for the first time in weeks I forgot about wanting to kill myself.     At T+1:20 my thoughts became increasingly abstract and introspective. I felt euphoric and could look at my life with absolute objectivity. Why did I feel so bad about life? In this state it didn\'t make sense as I went over each detail. I looked up and saw a plain brick wall explode with geometric and intricate patterns that had been there all along but hiding in plain sight. The world was beautiful.    T+2:00 Objects appeared to grow and shrink as I looked at them but there were no overt OEV. I closed my eyes and sure enough colourful patterns and spirals filled my Visual fields. I felt great, Better than I had for longer than I could remember. I understood my place in life and at that moment understood my purpose. I wanted the feeling to last forever. This sensation lasted for a number of hours.     T+6:30 effects diminishing and I felt tired both physically and mentally. I went to lie down and closed my eyes. There were still some mild CEVs at this point and I felt a inner peace that I hadn\'t felt before.     The next morning I woke up to find that the effects of the seeds were gone but so too was the depression. I felt good!     Over the next few days the familiar Black fog drifted back but less so than before. <!-- While I wouldn\'t recommend doing what I did there seems to be some potential here and I hope that in the future these effects can be harnessed to treat depression in a controlled environment.--> I will continue to explore this avenue!"
101461,A Non-Linear Fun but Rough Trip,Garth Kone,"Jun 2, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"I had read about the LSA containing seeds of the H.B. Woodrose online and have recently had a pang to experience something new and unconventional that I could acquire easily so ordered 50 of them untreated online really inexpensively for the price of \xa33.99 or around 6.45. I had a little experience of psychedelic and euphoric drugs having in the past taken salvia, Acid just once or twice (but forgot the experience due to alcohol), Many times taken ketamine but by and large kept to milder stuff or stimulants like weed, ecstasy, speed (but had trips on it with large amounts), coke and a majority of opioids. Maybe this was why I was panging for something psychedelic since I had barely touched drugs recently save for a little ecstasy a few weeks back. I have grown bored of the old kicks and look for something more substantial or dare I say spiritual.    As it was my day off from both University and Work I had very little sleep the night before so was up early yet tired and then the mail arrived. I could have gone to sleep but I was too excited so immediately soaked 6 of the seeds, I then scrapped off the toxic coating of the seed and looked for my grinder in order to extract the LSA in liquid but couldn\'t find it. l I looked and looked ... and looked, so I was going to have to ingest the seed itself orally which from most reports I have read was leaving me wide open to nausea.    At around 11-11.30PM, I started to chew each of them one by one until they were thoroughly pasted in my mouth and washed it with a warm mint to to aid the ingestion. The seeds did not taste particularly strong surprisingly.    By 12 pm I already started to feel the seeds effects as I was getting slight closed eye visuals whenever I blinked, but nothing too intense along with mild upset stomach.    At 12.30 pm the nausea was much stronger so I lay on my back already in my bed and felt generally loose my arm and legs felt as though they were experiencing some tension which wasn\'t really that unpleasant as opposed to the nausea. Being aware of the slight tension made me feel more aware of my movements and how I focused on moving which makes me think my sense of feeling was affected as I touched my matte painted wall and felt the texture. I tried to ingest some diet cola but it was very rough on my throat yet I was read of rehydration otherwise this would get rougher.    About ten minutes later I drank some fresh orange juice and it went down much easier. With rehydration I felt better With rehydration I felt better and the juice was cooling on my gullet even though It made my stomach feel more full which meant there was a more conscious effort to hold the contents down. The experience was getting stronger too, The closed a visuals would linger when I opened my eyes. if I had to describe the visuals I would say a mild morphing swish of light.    I thought I would see how it would affect my perception of things so watch a fractal video but to be honest it just made me a little weary and then watched a random Leslie Nielson comedy instead and fell asleep, noting the LSA had not affected my humor or made me giggly.    I woke up around 4.00 PM and felt much less nauseated and with intense closed eye visuals, mild open eye visuals and a general sense of being detached from it all. It made me wonder if this was the peak of the experience or whether I had that but been asleep something I had wondered once before when I swallowed an ecstasy and immediately fallen asleep only to have woken up several hours later sweaty like I had been through it all. The feeling was pretty good, Nothing too intense or trippy.    By around 5pm I was feeling pretty regular and altogether again, Though intermittently through the even nod off with a slight lingering feeling. The passage of time looking back seemed much lessened even taking into account my sleeping.    Looking back on the experience I would say that I would have preferred something a little stronger but of course this is not LSD so I\'m not very surprised. It just felt like the start of something or add on to something and not an experience in and of itself, I believe that some weed or even a mild dosing of valium would help each potentiate the other <!-- and plan to try this at some point in the future-->.     I will definitely prepare the extraction next time because the nausea really stopped this from being a fun and detached time but having a strong stomach stopped me from purging. I also think I will pick my setting better next time both the mood and venue, With a group of people or outside would bring out some of the aspects of the drug much better than say experimenting in the house whilst tired."
112566,Two Hours Passed With No Result,Willie the Rat,"May 27, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Woodrose July 2018    Preparation:  Ground 15 seeds into fine powder with mortar and pestle. Soaked in 40 proof vodka for 12 hours to kill toxins. Spilled result onto a paper napkin to let vodka drain out then wrapped remains in the napkin and swallowed with water on stomach empty for 8 hours. Ate seeds at 1:00. Two hours passed with no result.    3:00 Light nausea. Unpleasant feeling. Ache in balls.  3:15 First yawns. Always a sign things are about to happen. Very tired. Took small toke of grass.   3:30  Very tired. Drank some good orange juice in hopes of getting some energy back. Dont feel insightful, or creative.   4:00   I start to understand, and then I dont.     Insight: Stop trying. There is nothing there to understand. (Thats the trick.) Reading some Buddhist scripture is has been very difficult for me to understand. Now makes sense.    4:12 Lay down. Walking not easy.  5:35 Get up to do some meditation.  I keep getting sucked back into thinking.      Recording some insights on tape recorder: On trying not to think. We are stuck in flypaper of thought. The harder we try to get out, the more stuck we are in it. I keep thinking I dont know anything, but there is nothing to know. Truth itself is an illusion. Im asking, What is there to do? The answer comes to mind.  Just wake up. You dont have to do anything. It will come to you.  What will come? I cant imagine. Watching  the USA slide into a swamp of words  meant to confuse, diffuse,  disarm. How can we not think? It sees an unfair thing to ask. The act of asking in itself is an illusion. Love and hate  the two do not exist without description. Before that the two do not exist. There is something else, beyond thought. But there is no escaping although I think a few have done it.     I always get into, What should I do? and the answer is always, Relax. You dont have to do anything it will come. Just relax. Reality seems an illusion. A constant stream of events keep us distracted, occupied. No room to really think, or see.    Physical description: Time is very messed up. Seems to go both forward and backward. Sometimes seem to stop. A feeling of being in contact with someone, something. A very spiritual experience. Answers come to questions.    6:00 Still seem to be in contact with something spiritual. Reading dreams I have recorded. Meanings seem easy, obvious.     Thoughts on illness: Body reacts to stress. Can be cured by relaxing. A lot of stuff about relaxing  stress and TV news, the job. Let go of it. So hard to see. Hard to believe.    7:00 Some creative thoughts. Writing a poem.  8:00 Starting to come down a little. Balance still off. Being very careful as I begin to move around. All this time has been at my desk, in bed or sitting on meditation cushions.    9:00 Ate some chicken and drank more orange juice. Felt good on empty stomach.  Watched some TV and was able to fall asleep around midnight.  Felt good the following day."
97818,I Wanted to Die,SpiceIsNice,"May 19, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first experience trying Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds. I work for a local headshop, and my boss and I went to an Adult convention in Miami. We saw a booth that had some Kratom samples, we grabbed those, but, in the bottom of the samples he gave us 10 HB Woodrose seeds. I was like, what are these, coffee beans? The dude working there was like, Its an LSA, and you can keep those if you take all 10 of them. So, I said I would. Monday morning came around, my boss asked me to stop by his house. He said that I could try the seeds. At this point, I didnt know what LSA was, I did not know what to expect. See, I am the Ginny Pig for the Headshop. I am the Ginny Pig for the Headshop. I test everything before we sell it. I want to make sure it works. Boy was I in for a Hella ride!    10:30 AM: I was allowed to chew 3 seeds\x85..It was like eating sunflower seeds. No effect at the time. My boss J crushed 7 seeds and put them in water and nuked it for like 2 minutes making a Tea out of it.    10:32 AM: The tea was ready, so, J let it sit for 30 minutes.    11:02 AM: He said I needed to gulp it down and eat the residual seeds. Well, I did it. Little did I know that you have to sip it over 20-40 minute period. He must have read up on it before preparing it. I didnt know that I was in for a really weird experience.    12:00 PM: BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!! I started feeling like I wanted to puke. Every time I bent over, I could feel queasy.      12:30 PM: Im sweating like a bitch now. I was so hot. I had to go outside and take off all of my clothes (not a pretty site). I like my body was on fire.    1:30 PM: I sat naked outside in the sun texting all of my family thinking that I was going to die and no one would know where Im at. I started researching the seeds on my cell phone.    1:35 PM: My boss J had me work from his home, and to actually function as a normal person. So, here I am staring at a computer screen and all of the peoples heads kept getting bigger and smaller. I just couldnt focus or concentrate on my work. I was thrilled to watch the magic of the LSA distort my vision. I couldnt stop looking at my arms; they were huge, kind of like Popeye the Sailor Man. My clothes felt baggy on me.     2:00 PM: Of course, while working from my bosss house, I had to change his babys diapers. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The diapers looked like huge granny panties fat woman wear. Every time I attempted the diaper, I was like, WOW! J, these diapers are the wrong size, their HUGE! When I picked the baby up, they were normal size again.     2:15 PM: I was scared to die, so, I started to write out my last words on paper, in case I die. At this point, I chilled on his couch, and slept for a minute staring at Sid the Science Kid with his kids. J figured that since I couldnt get any work done, he wanted me to just babysit his kids.    2:30 PM: I am now the baby whisperer. Its like I can read the thoughts of his twin 20 month-olds. I had more fun taking care of his kids till about 6pm.     I want to say that I had a good experience, however, make sure you know about it before trying it. <!-- I heard that youre not supposed to eat up to 4-5 hours before taking it, because youll puke. -->The good news is that I never puked, and I wanted to call 911 at least 4 times."
81804,Nice Stuff!,DiabSoule667,"May 6, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"After a nice trip to a local University to see a friend of mine, my girlfriend, two friends, and myself decided to head to a little plant store just outside of the town. There we acquired approx. half an ounce of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, among other plants. Several days after our return, I decided it would be a nice idea to give them a try. Here is a brief description of what followed.    At approximately 5 pm, I ingest a soda bottle cap sized chunk of fresh ginger to help with any nausea I could possibly experience with the HBWR.     5:30 pm, I ate 5 HBWR seeds, after having scraped the fuzzy outer coating off of the seed. (<!--There are many sources on the net saying that the fuzzy outer layer of the seed contains cyanogenic compounds that, if ingested, can cause cyanide poisoning. There is no concrete evidence to support or oppose this bit of information, but -->I figured better safe than sorry.)    6:00 pm, I feel the first subtle waves of LSA intoxication wash over my being. It\'s a familiar buzz, similar to that which the LSA\'s in Ipomea violacea provide, but more similar I think to the buzz felt under the influence of psilocybin containing mushrooms. Very relaxing, almost sedating. It\'s like a chemical massage.    6:15 pm, I threw on some music, a compilation entitled Unity Dub\'s Voyage into Paradise. A very relevant title, I think. I can\'t quite tell if there\'s any difference between the first wave of the drug and what I\'m feeling now. There\'s a slight sensation of distance from my head. I\'m definitely tripping, but it\'s nothing really spectacular.    6:30 pm, I ate another two seeds to boost the trip. I\'d like to see if I can reach the point where I\'m experiencing visuals, and where my mind is set on overdrive. I feel like there\'s something lacking with this drug. Not psychedelic enough for my liking (haha).    7:30 pm, The album I put on is close to over, and I\'m starting to feel nice and trippy. There are some pretty tracers following things around the room, it\'s quite entertaining. I decide that maybe it would be a nice idea to smoke a bong load or two of some good dank and relax. It\'s time to find out where this drug will take me.    7:40 pm, I\'ve finished smoking, and now seem to be overpowered by the cannabis. The LSA might as well have left my system already. I\'ve finished smoking, and now seem to be overpowered by the cannabis. The LSA might as well have left my system already. I decide to take one last seed to boost. Probably shouldn\'t, but oh well. It\'s fun to experiment. I\'m having some strange flashes of color behind my closed eyelids, like in-between a high dose of cannabis and a  low dose of mushrooms. The music in the background is relaxing, Younger Brother does wonders for that sort of thing.    8:40 pm, I\'m thinking maybe it wasn\'t the best idea to add that extra seed. Still no trace of the nausea everyone talks about, but I\'m feeling an excess of physical energy. I think I\'ll go for a quick walk, see if I can get it under control.    9:00 pm, Back home in bed, still feeling a little off, but getting better. I\'m starting to settle into a nice soft sort of psychedelic state. Visual distortions are more pronounced, things seem to waver and peel almost like flames, and shimmer with a mild iridescent quality. My thoughts are easily guided with a small amount of focus. This drug would be a great help along a spiritual journey.    11:00 pm, I decide to get up and get something to snack on. The only thing I can find is a bowl of Captain Crunch. Poor choice. The dry cereal mixed with the milk has an awful textural quality. I force myself to eat the whole thing, as I haven\'t eaten since around 2 and I know I need something. The trip has been moving in mild waves, similar to LSD, but with not as pronounced high points. At the low points, the effects are almost unnoticeable, but soon make a full return. I feel like this would be a good intro drug to psychedelics.    1:00 am, I decide to smoke some Calea to help put me to sleep, as I remember I have to be to class in the am. The Calea sends me into a very visual state, not like dreaming, but like my thoughts are explained in the form of a film. A nice way to end the night.    8:00 am, I wake up to the sound of my alarm, feeling refreshed and surprisingly well rested. I\'m quite satisfied with last night\'s endeavor.    All in all, I had a great time. I feel that these types of LSA\'s are a wonderful alternative to LSD, although not nearly as visually stimulating as LSD. I\'ve done them twice since this trip, and still no nausea whatsoever. I\'ll definitely be experimenting more with this wonderful tool in the future."
85018,My Mind Sends Me to Outer Space,CM Go,"Apr 17, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"My wife and I have been trying several different plant based entheogens lately including Ayahuasca, Morning Glory seeds, Syrian Rue, etc.. The only problem is neither one of us are Psychonauts so we tend to be a little on the apprehensive side and do less than we really need so we don\'t have as \'good\' of an experience as we\'d like. So this time I was brave and decided to go for it!    I followed the directions on prepping the seeds and ate my dose around 9:30pm. I\'ve been on vacation so there was no need to worry about getting up or anything for the next few days. I got my trip setting ready and settled down for what I hoped to be an enlightening experience.    After an hour I still felt pretty much normal, half hour more and I started getting somewhat cloudy vision with some fisheye vision. I could feel it creeping up on me. I was giddy with excitement hoping that this would cool. Soon thereafter I was kicking back, resting, eyes closed and next thing I know my mind sends me to outer space. I mean I was traveling across the galaxy like superman, visions of beautiful colors, bright stars, and all forms of colored clouds all around! It was 100% fantastic! Then I would open my eyes and just faintly see things distorted. Most of my \'eyes wide open\' visions were fairly subtle, but when I went into the lucid dream state it was profoundly different!    After about an hour of this, my wife was continually checking on me and trying to tell her what I was experiencing, but I was having a hard time communicating. It was like I was blazed beyond all comprehension and couldn\'t talk on a single subject for any length of time. I was enjoying this immensely!    I chilled for another hour and got the thought of gummy bears in my head. I was lucid dreaming of the care bears for some reason and the made me thing of gummy bears. Luckily we had a few packages for the kids on hand and she brought me a pack. Let me tell you I\'ve never had anything as good tasting as those gummies ever in my life!!!! The flavor was so intense that I had to eat them one at a time savoring each and every one to the last speck of candy fruitiness was gone from my mouth. My wife still jokes about how crazy I sounded slurping and smacking those bears for 2 hrs!! OMG I want to do it again just to enjoy those damn bears!     So needless to say I thoroughly loved my trip and am very much looking forward to doing this again! Overall the experience lasted about 7hrs and will do it again. <!-- My only advise to someone wanting to do this is to have some yummy candy, probably just gummies around to enjoy! Don\'t miss out on that part of the trip! I promise you if you don\'t have them, you\'ll be missing out!!! Enjoy your trip and share your experience with others! -->"
51582,XBOX 360 Music Visuals,Chaotic_Euphoria,"Sep 13, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Well first off this was my first time and I did not know anything about LSA or Woodrose seeds.  I went to my friends house because he told me that this was some cool stuff that he read up on and purchased some for one of our Psychadelic Experiments.  Well I get there and he tells me we have to shave of the outsides of them that knowledge was gratefully gotten from a harm reduction website.  But anyways we got them completely shave and we took them.    [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    My friend too 12 and I took 12 because he told me this was a low does....last time I ever listened to him again.  We sat around watching Alice in Wonderland for like an hour and a half.  I felt really giggly and things that weren\'t cool to stare at suddenly became very interesting. 2 1/2 hours later it was almost time for me to go home, because my friend told me it would have had all started and been controllable by this time.  I started to get really giggly and really off balance and I looked at my pupils and they were huge.  For some reason I decided I should still go home because I don\'t like my friend when his trips don\'t work well because he gets all whiney and stuff.  I just ruins it when peeps get whiney.  So I took off in my car and my girl friend calls and I\'ve driven on some stupid shit like DXM but this was actually amazingly easy other then the paranoia of my girlfriend finding out that I was in my onset of a Baby woodrose trip.    Well I finally got through that I got to my house after experiencing extreme tunnel vision like MDMA and that wierd feeling like I\'m going way faster than I am, I got in my house and said hi to my mom and went straight for the kitchen feeling extremely shaky and crazy.  I ate some chilly... Because my mom told me I wasn\'t eating enough so this was were it got really crazy.  I ate the chilly and I was body trippin but not my mind.  I went down in my room and turned on my XBOX 360 to look at the kickass visual things that come on in the music player.  This was at 3 Hrs in and it hit me!    You can move the visuals around witht the joysticks on the controler and I had some kick ass techno going at the same time so I felt like I was flying through a space tunnel in these crazy visuals. <!--(PEOPLE SHOULD TRY THIS with an XBOX or an XBOX 360) i-->It was like one of those Gyro-rides that they strap you into and you get spun all around.  Man I was tripping my balls off running around my room like a mouse in a 4inch X 4inch box.  It was like MDMA mixed with the mentals of shrooms.  I had to periodically go get water because I was sweating like crazy.  I had to get to bed at some time but it was running on 11:30 and my mind was racing.  So finally after rolling around in bed I passed out......    At 1:30 in the morning I had to piss bad.  So I went up stairs and my mom and her boyfriend were still up... I got a glass of water and my moms boyfriend was standing right next to me (BANG)  I woke up on the floor with my mom screaming and her boy friend yelling my name.  I was wondering what the hell just happened when I realized I must have passed out because I was holding my breath without feeling.  I was still tripping hard at 1:30 in the morning with two grown adults wondering what the hell I was on.  Some how I managed to get them to believe me that I wasn\'t on anything (I don\'t know how they didn\'t notice my pupils) .  They gave me a glass of water and I went down to my room and stood there smoking a cigarette.  I went back to bed at 2:00 and I was finally on the down fall at that point.  I never had a trip as cool on Baby woodrose seed again (this could be due to the fact that my mind never fully recovered because ever time I did them again was within a week to 4 days of some other Psychadelic)."
106434,I Call Her Baby Purge,Lanus S,"Sep 7, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Hawaiian Baby Purge Woodrose    I decided to have my first encounter with hawaiian baby woodrose (Argyreia nervosa) na\xefvely, without doing too much research. I opened the bag containing 10 seeds at 1 pm. The seeds were dark brown, sort of angular-globular, around 5 mm in diameter. They were half covered in a thin layer of reddish fluff, which had apparently been removed for the most part.     I put the seeds in my mouth and sucked on them for a few minutes, tasting them. The taste was not unpleasant, but somehow alarming. The taste was not unpleasant, but somehow alarming. Gently and instinctively, I started removing the fluff with my teeth, swallowing it, drenched in saliva. When the seeds were bare, I spit them in my hand. They were all bald and shiny now. First I put one back in my mouth, slowly crushing it with my jaw. Then the next, and so on. After chewing for several minutes I had a mouthful of baby woodrose slush. The taste, again, was not unpleasant, a bit like lemonade. I swallowed.    I started the 9 km bike ride to my vegetable garden. I had imagined enjoying the beauty of my garden, which is in bloom this time of year, tripping on baby woodrose. After about 20 minutes, I had to park my bike and vomit. Luckily, perhaps wisely, I had eaten very little that morning, so my puke was clear, frothy, and small in amount. I thought the effect of baby woodrose would be diminished greatly now, ejecting her after just 20 minutes. My assumption proved false.    I puked four or five times more on my way to the garden, raising the occasional dog walker\xb4s eyebrow. When I had finally arrived, feeling nauseous, increasingly weak and cold (there blew a chilly breeze and I was too optimistically clothed), I discovered that the neighbouring farmer was just gearing up his tractor to raid the wheat with pesticide. Good bye fairy tale garden experience. I decided to bike the 9 km back home, to warmth and safety. I felt weak and nauseous all this time, very sensitive to the stink of exhaust fumes, asphalt, the city. I began to wonder if baby woodrose should be classified as an ordeal poison, or is the poison in the city. I began to wonder if baby woodrose should be classified as an ordeal poison, or is the poison in the city.    I must have arrived home around 3 pm, still feeling weak, nauseous and cold. I barely managed locking my bike, unlocking the front door. Having closed the door behind me, I found myself in safety. I fell to my knees and starting puking freely, thanking baby woodrose for the purge, asking her to release me. After wiping up my vomit with a towel, I retreated under the bed cover. Soon, the nausea disappeared and I was starting to warm up. I now felt cold shivers run through my body, which I recognized as the onset of psychedelic good times (though I have not felt quite the same shivers during my encounters with mushrooms and ayahuasca). My face was grimacing smilingly, I was really starting to trip now, a little more than 2 hours after ingestion.    I\xb4d say baby woodrose, mushroom and aya are vehicles that take you to the same place of well-being, but the journey there is flavoured differently, dependent on the drug. In mushrooms, the purge is less physical than with aya or baby woodrose; no vomiting. With woodrose, I had no visuals in bright daylight, but some enhancement of colour behind closed eyelids. Also some of the symmetrical patterns in carpet etc., so familiar from the mushroom trip. The high lasted for a good 3 hours more, before starting to wear off, leaving me happy, thankful, cleansed, ready for a healthy meal.    I call her \xb4baby purge\xb4, she is no joke. 12 hours after ingestion, while writing this report, her spirit still hovers over me."
110771,Capsuled HBWR Method,WanderGod,"Jul 16, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"This method has been tried before and has been successful at eliminating / minimizing the nauseating effects of \'LSA (Lysergic acid amide)\'.    SUPPLIES: HBWR Seeds, 00 Pill Capsules, Grinder or Hammer and Plastic Bag, and real ginger root (for when I\'m actually gonna take it).    STEPS: If I can, I limit the light exposure in the room. LSA is known to be light sensitive.     1.If I have a grinder, I grind my chosen amount of seeds (3-4 seeds) into a powder.   2. I empty the contents onto a plate or a sheet of paper   3. I put the contents into the capsule and close them securely.    CONSUMPTION: I would take the pill on a empty stomach for maximum absorption, eating less than 2 hours before and after consumption may lead to increased nausea.    After taking the pill, I proceed to chew on a slice of fresh ginger root the size of about 3 stacked quarters.    Onset takes about 1 hour - 2 hours. Total time is about 9-12 hours    MINI TRIP REPORT:   For me there was no noticeable nausea after taking a does of 4 hammered seeds in a capsule. That trip was very euphoric, which came in waves. <!-- If you know how to meditate I highly recommended you do.-->I meditate. Also binaural beats became a trigger for these euphoric waves. There were no visuals on that trip but that was most likely because I had eaten about 1 hour before consumption.     On another trip where I took a capsule with 6 seed; I experienced CEV\'s and light OEV\'s. And that capsule was taken immediately after eating a big meal so I\'m sure that could have been way more intense. Also I make sure not to take them while tired or sleepy... I wont get to fall asleep.    <!-- Anyways, be safe guys. Wish you all happy trip :)-->"
34257,Refreshing Slumber,Digitalfish,"May 27, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"I was apprehensive at first about trying this material, as I am an experienced tripper but a friend of mine seriously hurt himself on the same seeds.  Although to his credit, I don\'t think he knew to scrape the fuzzy gunk off the seeds first.    Chopped the gunk off of 12 seeds, then mashed the remainder of the seeds and placed them in a shallow glass bowl, filling just enough to cover them with fresh-squeezed lemon juice.  Placed this bowl into a  larger one with hot water to expedite the extraction.    After one hour, I strained the juice through a coffee filter, mixing the lemon juice with a cup of OJ.  Tasting the straight lemon juice I could immediately tell by the very astringent bitter taste that it had soaked up some interesting alkaloids!  In fact the bitterness was still apparent even when mixed in with the OJ.      Taking each bitter mouthful, I\'d let it sit for about a minute, slowly squeezing the juice down my throat.  Within 30 minutes I had the first clear signs of intoxication, as the lights started their LSD-familiar \'tinkerbell dance,\' as I so lovingly call it.    Feeling a bit uneasy and slightly queasy I decided to lay down for a cat nap.  I fell asleep and slept a good seven hours.  I just woke up and can honestly say that this material beats the hell out of OTC sedatives for sleep!    Even now though, I feel its effects in the background.  My mood has improved significantly since before I fell asleep.  Perhaps this is the lingering LSA \'plastifying\' my neurons.    +1, with definite possibility for a repeat at a larger dose."
33529,8 Seeds Was Too Much for Me,attorney,"May 25, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Mindset & Setting:  It was a Sunday afternoon, I wasn\'t in a particularly happy or sad mood, more like a bored mood, in my house with my two non-tripping flatmates. They knew what I was doing, but were not very experienced in dealing with people on substances.    Preparations:  Only the usual mind preparation I do, working myself up to taking a substance, which doesn\'t consist of meditation or yoga or anything, rather just telling myself occasionally \'ok be ready\'.     Dosage:  I got 8 of my Hawaaian Baby Woodrose seeds and ground them up by smashing them with a brick. I chose 8 because from reading other posts that seemed like an average number, and my previous water extraction using 10 was very mild. I put the ground up seeds in a piece of bread, and ate the bread at roughly 4 o\'clock.    The Experience:  For the first two hours or so I didn\'t really notice much, I thought that yet again I would have a quite mild experience, so I relaxed somewhat. At around the two hour mark it was time for dinner, but I wasn\'t very hungry feeling a little sick at this time. I tried to eat it anyway, but couldn\'t stop laughing. My flatmate was telling me \'if you dont eat it you won\'t get any icecream!\' which I found to be hilarious, and it seemed no matter how much I ate off the plate there didn\'t ever seem to be any less there. I knew at this point I was in for something a little stronger than I was used to, only being experienced in weed and ecstacy.    After dinner (I didn\'t manage to eat it all) we started watching a TV show which was about the most venomous animals on the planet. This was probably the worst thing I could have been watching at that time as I was thinking about how I\'d read the seeds are poisonous (and I was feeling pretty sick) and was what probably turned the trip a bit sour. I got up to go to the fridge and realised I was very uncoordinated, and that I was feeling pins-and-needles in my arms and ears. I also noticed that everything was becoming distorted, the walls were \'bendy\' like in a cartoon, and when I walked to the fridge it seemed a lot smaller than normal.    The trip gradually intensified from this point until I was seeing some pretty insane stuff, there appeared to be wavy lines everywhere and were making up everything, and there were also a lot of trails. I checked my pupils which were about halfway dilated at this point. I can\'t really remember too much more of the trip other than I got quite sick and threw up after about 3.5 hours. When I went to bed I checked my pupils again, and they were absolutely huge. I looked at some trippy pictures I had which seemed to have little animals or creatures within them that I normally couldn\'t see. When I closed my eyes all I could see were what appeared to be pixels making strange patterns in my head. It was incredibly intense and I couldn\'t get to sleep for a couple of hours, constantly having to get up to go to the toilet. Finally at about 12 o\'clock I was able to get to sleep.    In Retrospect:  I would never do that many seeds again. It really can\'t be expressed in this report how incredibly intense it was, especially for someone like me who didn\'t have that much experience. The last half of the trip was very unenjoyable, mostly because of its intensity. Next time I might try half as much as this, if I can work up the courage."
102380,Had an Interesting Time but Was It Worth It,anonymous,"May 15, 2019",H.B. Woodrose & Pharmaceuticals,"I took Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for the first time on January 21, 2014. I was with my boyfriend at his house at the time; he was sick with the flu and asleep for most of my trip. I should note that I have bipolar disorder and at the time of my experience I was taking two anti-depressants, one low dose anti-psychotic and one mood stabilizer for my condition. I was taking two anti-depressants, one low dose anti-psychotic and one mood stabilizer for my condition.    The recommendation was four to eight seeds; I took six. Because I had been warned about nausea, half an hour before I took the seeds I took a prescription anti-nausea drug called Zofran. I used a razor blade to shave the fuzzy coating off the seeds, as was recommended; it wasn\'t too hard though it did take awhile, about 20 or 25 minutes altogether. The seeds looked like chocolate chips and didn\'t have much of a taste, kind of cardboardy. They were hard to chew. I washed the last bits down with a can of pop.    I took notes throughout the experience, beginning with:    3:31 p.m. Just ate some Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. They did not taste too bad -- in fact they had almost no taste at all. Now I wait.  3:44 p.m. No effects yet. Okay, mouth does feel a bit numb, but that\'s it. No nausea, thank goodness.  4:03 p.m. Okay, I think something is starting to happen now.  4:07 p.m. The computer screen is inexplicably fascinating to me. My legs feel weird. Some mild nausea.    A few minutes later I checked my eyes; the pupils were huge.    4:35 p.m. So far a disappointment. I don\'t feel good, I just feel weird. But we\'ll see what happens; I\'ve got seven hours to go. My nose is running. I don\'t know if it\'s the seeds, or if I\'m catching [my boyfriend\'s] flu. Chances are the latter.    My nose was running like a faucet and I took two NyQuil gel tablets to make it stop. It did, and the next day it wasn\'t running so I think the congestion might have been a symptom of the drug. I think the congestion might have been a symptom of the drug.    4:38 p.m. 2CE provided a much better trip. Which is probably why it\'s as illegal as **** now (although it wasn\'t when I bought it).  5:01 p.m. Okay, so far this hasn\'t been pleasant at all. The hit I\'m getting isn\'t worth the nausea (which has got pretty bad now in spite of meds).  5:12 p.m. Okay, just got sick, ironically while trying to take another anti-nausea tablet.  5:20 p.m. Feel much better since I ralphed. Unexpected effects: valium-like forgetfulness and loss of fine motor skills.    As far as loss of fine motor skills and some of the gross ones: I was swaying around like a drunk, occasionally bumping into the wall. I was also making a lot of typos when I took my notes, and writing down words in the wrong order, which is something that happens when I\'m under the influence of valium.    The forgetfulness was more like an uncertainty. I could remember things, but it felt as if they had happened to someone else, a long time ago, and I wasn\'t sure my memories were real. I wasn\'t even 100% sure I\'d vomited in the toilet that evening, though I remembered doing so.    5:36 p.m. Okay, I am DEFINITELY feeling the drug\'s affects now. This has gotten...interesting. Strange perceptions.  6:41 p.m. Now THIS is more like it. I am enjoying myself. This made the nausea worth it. Should have induced vomiting sooner anyway.    My perceptions were nothing like I\'ve experienced on any other drug I\'ve tried. Everything felt like it was two seconds behind. That is, I would do something, like walk around or sit down, and it felt like I wasn\'t aware I was doing it until two seconds later.    I called a good friend and spent about 45 minutes talking to him. We actually had a very deep conversation. It felt like my inhibitions were lowered and I think I said some things I wouldn\'t have said if I had not been stoned. I was deeply relaxed and felt kind of dissociated from myself. After speaking to my friend I mostly wandered around the house and surfed the internet while keeping an eye on my sick boyfriend.    I started to come down at around six hours in. I started to come down at around six hours in. Within half an hour to forty-five minutes I felt almost normal. I was very tired whether from the NyQuil or the seeds I don\'t know and decided to go to bed. I slept long and deep, waking at 9:00 a.m. feeling normal again.    VERDICT: It was okay. This was a quite pleasant experience, but I could really have done without the nausea in the first hour. It might have improved matters if I\'d let myself vomit sooner, as the nausea all but disappeared afterwards. The high was very calm and soothing and, I think, made the nausea worth it, but only just. I might try Hawaiian Baby Woodrose again, but this certainly wasn\'t the best drug experience I\'ve ever had."

109524,"I Couldn\'t Fall Asleep, and Was Very Nauseous",Roofy,"Apr 22, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"First HBWR LSA Experience    So this other day I had some HBWR seeds in my drawer which I ordered online. I\'ve tried making an extract of 9 seeds before, but I messed up something in the process. I read on the internet about a sublingual HBWR ingestion method, as the side effects aren\'t that horrible. I hate nausea and being nauseous.    This one evening at around 17:00 I went outside with 2 friends and brought the seeds with me. Not knowing what to expect, I went to the store and bought some water and Coca Cola (helps the nausea), and a chocolate bar for some kind of munchies. I proceeded to go to a beautiful, discreet place by a lake, and one of the friends brought a tiny joint with only about 0,3g of herb in it. I only took 1 hit and got a little bit high.    At around 17:35 I put 7 seeds in my mouth, soaked them in my saliva and crushed them with my teeth. I kept them in until 18:10, we took a walk through a forest, it was very dark and snowy. I had 2 cigarettes with a 15 minute interval. I expected to feel the first effects at around 18:45, but there was nothing.    At around 18:55 I took 3 more seeds, crushed and kept in my mouth. 18:05 is when I got tired of keeping them in my mouth and swallowed them. We kept walking around until 21:10, I had no effects at all, I was only slightly relaxed.    When I got home, I wasn\'t feeling that well, but I really craved some food. I ate some lasagna.    At around 22:30 I chewed on 4 more seeds and swallowed them. We started joking around with a friend about the seeds, and that they\'re either bad and have a really low potency, or they have a delayed fuse and soon I\'ll be tripping pretty bad (first psychedelic experience).    At around 24:00 I started feeling really drunk, just as if I had 3-4 beers, I ate a bar of Mars and drank my Coca Cola. It peaked at around 1:00, there were absolutely no OEV\'s, and very, very slight CEV\'s of geometric figures dancing around with the beat of music, I felt reaaally drunk.    I turned off my computer and got into bed at 1:30. I couldn\'t fall asleep, I was very nauseous. It got worse, so I sat at the edge of my bed, when I felt that it\'s getting worse, I walked down to the toilet. My thighs hurt, in the toilet I sat down by the sink and waited. There were a few moments when I gagged, but nothing really came out. I was in there for good 40 minutes, since it is winter and I was naked, I started getting really cold. I felt a little better, but I started shaking. When I got into bed, I pulled over 3 heavy blankets, I was shaking and very cold, as if I had a fewer, it went on for 20 minutes until I fell asleep. I don\'t remember my dream, but when I woke up at 7:55, I could see slight white halos around objects, and the street lights turning off when I looked at them. I fell back asleep, woke up at 10:30 sober."
42423,Selfishlessness,Pedigogue,"Apr 6, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"After plenty of research (mostly just reading other trip reports), I thought I would give the good ol\' H.B. a try.  I bought 50 seeds online for $15.  I made sure that they were the nice little fuzzy guys I\'d heard are the best.  A friend of mine and I ingested 10 seeds a piece at about 10:00 a.m.    I planned going for a hike, but found myself compelled to just be.  After about 45 minutes, some nausea took affect.  I usually would try to fight the feeling until the onset passed, but I really didn\'t find it to unpleasant to purge my body.  Not only did I release myself of the toxins, but found a cleansing feeling overtaking me upon releasing the seeds from my gut. It felt as though I had just had a shower for my soul.  My buddy held the seeds in, with little nausea. I think diet was the main differentiating factor in our two outcomes.  The trip came on strong shortly after I made friends with the toilette.    I\'m not sure how much time had passed, didn\'t really care.  My mind was off the walls.  It was some of the more intense soul searching I\'ve ever done.  As I rambled on for probably hours, my friend just sat in contentment and enjoyed the performance.  Some time had passed with him saying nothing, until he stopped me in mid sentence.  I think I was talking about care of others as being an overwhelming disease in my life.  I put others before myself.  He says to me nine words,\'the most important person in your life is yourself.\'  Right then and there, I discontinued verbal communication and changed my life.    Since that day, I still am a very compassionate, caring person, but I do everything for myself only.  This doesn\'t mean neglect others, but do what makes me happy over anything else.  This may include making others happy, or making others sad.  I am a changed person because of these seeds, and I have tripped on a lot of stuff before.  I am now more focused and centered than ever before, and have an intense understanding that life is an adventure in education.<!--Use the seeds wisely and they will teach you more than what is what.

26910,I Really Learned a LOT From This Trip,Hillman,"Mar 31, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"A GREAT Trip!I     Yesterday I experienced Hawiian Baby Woodrose Seeds for the first time.  I am 28 years of age, and it has been 9 years since I have experienced any hallucinigenic drugs.      I have been reading on the subject, and experiences others have had with Hawiian baby woodrose.  Despite some claims of stomach upset, I decided to keep positive thoughts, and give it a try.  I ordered a pack of 200 seeds online, and Tuesday AM I picked them up from the post office.  Being as I did not have any clients booked that day, and I had been contemplating some life issues, I decided it would be a great day to trip.  I only had a business lunch, and I just could not wait until the lunch was over to get started.  Being as I did not know how the reaction would be, I decided to take 2 seeds orally.  I simply scraped the seeds clean, making SURE to get all of the residue of the coating off.  I then bit the seeds open, and ground them up in my mouth, one at a time.<!--The taste was a lot like the taste of blotter acid.-->  I swallowed the remains, and off to lunch I went.    About half way through lunch I was feeling, well let\'s just say altered.  I do a lot of process meditating, and breathwork, so perhaps I have added more sensitivity to my mind.  I was having a challenging time focusing on the project I was there to discuss, and found myself getting pretty deep into things, and I knew this was not the time, nor the place.  I did the best I could to stick to business, and I ate a normal lunch.  My stomach was feeling fine.      [Erowid Note:  Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]    After lunch I drove back to my office, feeling something coming on, and I was surprised to be feeling this from just two seeds.  Back at the office I prepared five more seeds, and consumed them the same way.  I felt the slightest twinge in my stomach, but no big deal.  I stayed at the office for an additional hour, and then decided I would be better off at home.  So I drove home.     After getting home I was feeling like this was LSD.  I was tripping, and it was really nice.  All of the answers to the issues I was looking for were presented to me, and I really felt good.  I was having mild visuals, like the ceiling and walls moving ect.      I felt like I really learned a LOT from the trip, and I came down SO smooth it was like a dream.  No side effects at all!  I did not really want to eat that evening, and that was fine with me.  Sleep was not trouble, and I am definitely going to experience the seeds again.    I feel the best way to consume the seeds is to scrape them with a blunt object, and remove all of the \'coating\' until I have a pure brown seed.<!--I also recommend having great respect for nature, and the many ways nature has provided to get in touch better.-->  I may also attribute my great experience to tripping for a purpose, rather then just to party."
89577,White Fuel and Vinegar,Suunaabas,"Dec 6, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Firstoff, I\'ll admit I am an impatient person. After reading a few prep methods, I decided to combine a couple of them, trimming the parts not immediately available/doable. That said, my seeds may have been of an older stock too, which could account for a lessened intensity. I\'ll test this theory soon with the new batch of freshly harvested seeds.    Steps:  1) I smash the seeds as finely possible. At the time I had no mortar and pestle to make this easy. So I used a glass baking... pan (?) (which normally is used for cinnamon rolls and such) and a spoon.    2) Added HBW dust to glass jar, added Coleman\'s white fuel (used in lanterns for camping). I double-checked by reading all the text on the can, to ensure nothing about Benzine was mentioned. The amount of fuel used was about 1 cup.    3) Let sit over night, swishing the mixture about whenever I thought about it. In total, probably 18 to 22 hours. Kept in a cool environment, and my gloomy light-lacking abode.    4) Over the mouth of another glass jar I secured a coffee filter. Poured the fuel / HBW mixture through the filter, and let it drip mostly dry.    5) Ensuring no contents are lost from the filter, I removed it and placed it in the glass cookie pan to dry until no smell at all remained of the fuel (hours).    6) When completely dry, scraped the HBW dust from the filter and added it to the cleaned glass jar. Into this I poured about a cup of White Vinegar and let sit for an hour.    7) From jar into huge drinking glass goes the mixture, topping the drink off with Orange Juice.    8) Down the hatch and sit about waiting for my journey to begin.    Note: might have felt a tiny bit of nausea, but I\'m rather sure that was from drinking a load of Vinegar and OJ together. Admittedly not the most awesome tasting beverage to hit my tongue.    It was an overall mellow experience, lasting quite a few hours with light visuals. The effect was similar to the rise towards a nice LSD trip, where I\'m like \'fuck yeah, this feels all light and energy-y\'. But I\'m sure it would have been better during my normal hours in darkness -sans twats knocking at the door to sell wares or convert me. I did gain a lot of respect for WinAMP\'s Visualizations."
86108,5 Seeds. Or Was It 10?,FletcherHaven,"Aug 24, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Syrian Rue,"My Woodrose adventure started with taking 5 Pakistan grown seeds from a pack and smashing them up with a pestle and mortar. The seeds were notably more shell like with little \'meat\' in them if you will, compared to the Hawaian ones (I\'ll get to in a little bit). I want to mention here, for added effect I took about 20 rue seeds and ate them flat out.     After I mashed the woodrose seeds, I simply put them in water and let them soak maybe 5 minutes. I then used a coffee filter and filtered out the mixture and drank the water.  I saved the filter and pieces and put it all in the fridge in a baggy. I waited an hour or so and nothing was happening on my end. I got the mix back out and mashed it more in a cup with water again and this time made a real cloudy liquid with it. I then proceeded to again strain out the mash and drink THAT liquid. I discarded the filter and pulp this time.     A half an hour later still nothing going was on that I could detect. I then went and got out 5 Hawaian seeds and mortared those up.  I picked out the shells but this time I noticed the seeds were more meaty. The shells were harder to get apart from the white pulp but I picked out the larger seed shell brown parts and discarded them. This time I took a soda, took the grounds and ate them, then drank them down with soda just in case a flavor issue was to arise. I then went about my business around the house.     Not feeling anything a half hour later still, I ran to the store, got some things then came back and watched some tv. Bedtime was getting close. I noted maybe a little bit of feeling like I had a beer or something. I noted maybe a little bit of feeling like I had a beer or something. As I watched tv about an hour went by and I started to get up a lot. Having just gotten over the flu, I got up and drank some soda, went to the rest room and took some advils and layed back down. Maybe a half an hour after that I noticed I was feeling woozy and maybe seeing some colored patterns in my head when I closed my eyes and maybe even feeling more closer to intoxication. I was running and peeing a lot.     I went to bed and tried to go to sleep. I noticed my chest getting a little tight and my heart rate going up a little.  I had no nausea. I was expecting it but never got it. I had some food on my stomach and I may have felt just a small knot in my gut but nothing even major.  With my chest getting a little tight I figured I was too anxious and I went and got half of a xanax tablet and took that. A half an hour later, yet again, I was calming down but very antsy. My dog was pacing a lot too. It was a full moon and the dog for some reason needed to go out constantly. First the dog was thirsty, then had to go out, then thirsty again, then needed to go out. This went on 3/4 of the night. Meanwhile I was in bed, sweating like crazy. I\'d get up and change the thermostat a degree every 20 minutes. Eventually I took off my shirt and layed on the couch. I saw colors whizzing around but only with my eyes shut and it seemed the colors were distant swirls like a bad tv signal.      Part of my excersise in doing this incidentally, is to get in touch with more spiritual entities or \'the other side\' or being able to hear and see them better. As I lay there on the couch I could sense \'something\' in the chair across the room. I could even hear what sounded like someone IN the chair. All through the night I had every problem I have in my current life, go by me and I had a difinitive solution for each. There were times when that would cease and I got in a bit of a panic and wanted to sober up but couldnt. I then would tell myself to be calm, its only temporary and it would be over in a number preprescribed hours. I went to sleep just for a couple hours. It was restless sleep. My mind was racing so fast at times. Having to do work later in the day the next day, I felt and acted like morning-after drunkeness like wise cracking, but I had a clear head after having solved a lot of issues in my head.     The next night I slept like there was no tomorrow. Dreams are more rememberable and a little wacky like friends crossed with other friends, lol, but recurring older dreams coming forward. Nonetheless I don\'t have the spiritual connection I was seeking. I have DMT containing resins standing by for use perhaps in a few weeks. More reading and preparation needs to occur on the materials I have awaiting me there.     I making sure nothing I do will prohibit me from working on monday morning nor mess me up too bad to function undetected around the household. I am going to presume this exercise included 10 woodrose seeds after only drinking 5 and popping 5. The 5 I physically swallowed were Hawaian. The 5 liquid mashed ones were Pakistani."
94496,Fantastic Tracer Trip,Clowner,"Aug 23, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I ate 33 seeds at 10 0 clock in the morning. An hour later I vomited my fatty breakfast into my kitchen mixing bowl. After some exercising I was tired and still feeling stomach cramps so I laid down on my bed.    I felt the waves of the LSA coming into my body and the poison still mingling in my stomach. Poor stomach. I wanted to make some lunch but was too tired to get up. I was staring at TLC\'s first record and they looked like clowns from the thirties. There faces were changing & they didn\'t look like they were hip hop but clowns.  I felt like a clown too from the LSA.     The tracers started to come on and WHOAH they were way better than before. I moved my arm and hands and saw all sorts of color, red yellow green etc. I was just waving my arms around and I see color tracers. I would stare at the light bulb on the ceiling and various colors would form in it and the bulb was sparkling. My body felt mushy and and it was pulsating very much.  I stared at the clown girls again and I started making clowns noise. I was doing wild special effects. My voice was going bonkers. I was cracking some jokes but could barely speak because I was laughing and cracking up so much. I went to go pee pee and wow the trail of urine was amazing to stare at. wild colors and the droplets in the toilet mesmerized me. Still more sickness in the stomach and I vomited again.    I started making hand designs. Moving my hands around and seeing geometrics and colors and shapes. I wanted to draw some pictures but I was so tired from the hand tracers and I wanted to ease my sick stomach that I closed my eyes and relaxed on some twinkling color shapes. I fell asleep and after an hour I got up but the LSA had taken its toll but I was still sick so I went to go eat. It was hard to make some beef patties and I had to lay in bed all night to nurse my stomach back to health.  In summary it was an awesome trip but the stomcach wasn\'t worth it.    The best part about the seeds are the fantastic color tracer effects I got by waving my arms and hands around. This the the fourth time I\'ve done the seeds staring with 10 then 15 then 25 and then this 33 seed trip. Next time I might do 50 seeds but I will wait a while because my tummy needs a rest.  Enjoy your Trips!"
111649,"Chronic Pain, and Suicide",PenisFlavors,"May 29, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"My goal has always been to improve my depression and chronic illness. I started taking LSA in May of 2017, and quickly started taking the seeds every few days. It always made things better so I kept taking it. High doses, low doses, tons of weed, crazy edibles, and lots of kratom. I took a total of 300 HBWR seeds over the course of this time. This trip was the result of the last 15 seeds in the bag.    I had a panic attack 4 hours after taking the seeds, and I called my friend thinking I was literally going to die. This is kinda where it gets funny. I took a urine test for my physical two days prior and didn\'t think about how I had masturbated that morning, so when I gave the sample it had too much protein. So they thought my kindeys were failing. So of course the day before I\'m supposed to get my tests back I take a fuckton of LSA. Not exactly good set and setting.    I knew I was going to die. It was just what was going to happen. The seeds were poison, I had just given myself the fatal dose and I would be the first idiot to overdose on LSA. I saw my face on the news and the emotional video interview with my distraught family. My body was in so much pain, just unimaginable agony. Pain has been a part of my life always, but it\'s always interesting to see experiences make it better/worse, it reminds me that it\'s all just bullshit perception. I can endure anything, I have control over my mind.    But back to the panic. My throat was going to close up and I was going to die, in my parents house, right under their noses, for completely ridiculous and stupid reasons. I legitimately wrote up a giant post on /r/deadredditors before I sobered up enough to call my friend. She helped me make a note in case I did die, and I started to settle into it. I smoked a ton of weed, and what happened next is hard to describe. The whole world zoomed out and I saw all my old friends and lovers and everyone who has affected or been affected by my life. I started having conversations in my head with people I haven\'t seen in years. My life isn\'t terrible, at all really, so I didn\'t understand why I kept seeing myself hunched over on the edge of my bed crying my eyes out over and over again. I saw every bad social experience which reinforced all my depressive thoughts, every shitty thing I ever did, everything was just so clear.    The trip wasn\'t exactly pleasant, but I swear this was the first time in my life I ever cared this much if I lived or died. I used to beg for death, but when I finally faced it I could see clearly.            It took me quite a few hours to even come back to reality. I was lost in my head, talking to old friends and lovers. I wound up falling asleep at roughly 1am, and waking up at 6am.                  Here\'s the bottom line, my life is great. I still haven\'t accepted my death, but I\'ve started to accept my life. I\'m always astounded I\'m still alive after so many years of trying to destroy myself, all because of my bullshit overactive nerves and chemical imbalances (what doctors call depression) in my brain. I\'m over the guilt associated with needing painkillers 24/7, I\'m ready to live. I applied to a few jobs online just now which is a MASSIVE deal for me. The seeds are all gone now, I won\'t be able to get more for a while, but I don\'t know if I\'ll ever need them again.    I do however have a few psychedelics en route, but I\'m waiting the full two weeks at the very least. My next experience will be with LSD, for the first time realistically as my first and only dose did very little."

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    Allright, I\'d like to start off by saying that 25 seeds is ALOT to take. However, in my case I\'ve worked my way up to this dose and found that this particular batch of seeds is pretty weak. Once on a stronger variety of seeds I took only 8 and experienced some visuals and an overall trippy feeling.    But last night was the most interesting. I ate all the seeds at about 7:30pm. I noticed the almost immediate feeling of \'hmm, something is different\' before I had even finished chewing them all up and swallowed them (I never swallow them until the last one is chewed... having them in my mouth is not as disgusting as the actual act of swallowing). I then proceed to hang out with four of my friends in my dorm, who are aware that I have eaten the seeds.    8:30 - No nausea (although I have experienced severe nausea with morning glory seeds, which I don\'t enjoy because I have to eat so many of them its just sick). Feeling a little trippy, a little euphoric, not too much.    9:30 - We go out to smoke some bowls. I notice that my hands are pretty cold, which is because of the ergot alkaloids I guess (think Saint Anthony\'s Fire, except not nearly so bad. Smoking herb always amplifies the HWBR experience, and this time was no different. After smoking for about 15 minutes, my friend\'s heads started taking on strange forms. One became kind of skeleton-like, and the others looked strange, like in the movie Beetlejuice. We live in a dorm so we smoke in a car in the parking lot, so when we got out of the car to walk back into the dorm, all the other cars seemed to be rippling a bit, which I thought was pretty cool although I wanted to be inside.    10:30 - Well, we were inside playing video games which was alot of fun. There were some christmas lights strung up around the dorm room, and they seemed to surround me, but it wasn\'t very intense. At one point the room seemed to grow very tall and curvy, which was really cool but something distracted me and I snapped out of it. Too bad because it was really cool.    11:30 - The herb is wearing off, I forgot what I was doing at this point.    12:30 - I went to bed now... GOOD IDEA! I put on some Radiohead which was really intense, and stared at the ceiling, which is very close since I am on the top bunk. Pretty soon the ceiling was taking on a life of its own. It looked like energy was pulsing through it, and then parts of it would light up and I could feel that I was about to start tripping pretty good. The room kind of morphed to a cylidrical shape and soon I was getting some interesting visuals that looked like they were electicity-based. I loved it! Then it looked like footprints were moving around on the ceiling. I was feeling pretty euphoric too. But then my monitor turned itself off and the room was totally dark, and I lost most of the visual effect. I went to sleep very easily.    The next morning, not much effects today, I can force things to wave around a little bit in my vision, but overall I feel pretty well rested and normal."
13909,Sublingual Didn\'t Work,lizzybell,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"It was over a year ago that I first tried these little seeds.  I ate five of them and had the most painfully beautiful growing experience.  There was intense nausea that would come in waves that I would keep down with cloves and ginger.  I have been kinda weary about trying them again due to the toxic symptoms.  I recently read a report supported on a harm reduction website by a man who took nine seeds crushed mixed with water (tspn.)  allow to sit five minutes, add a little juice and put in one\'s mouth and under one\'s tongue for twenty minutes.   Well I tried it and only felt psychosomatic symptoms...  Oh well, maybe my mouth is flawed or something.  Maybe the seeds lost their LSA content over the year???  I am thinking their is no way around the nausea.  If one wants the experience, then one must sacrifice and let the purge work its wonder.  So maybe I should just eat them as normal and embrace the nausea.  Letting the plant extract the negative energy out of me.  Well good luck.  Take care."
110828,Fifty Percent Heaven Fifty Percent Hell,Stramonium,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Alcohol - Hard,"[Erowid Note:  The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid\'s \'heavy\' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    Back in 2013, I known like nothing about entheogen plants, just a fact that they can make people high and hallucinate, so I was kinda uneducated in this topic. As I never do anything like before beside alcohol and a very few joints of cheap weed, I decided to try HBRWR seeds.     On that day I was in a pretty depressed mood, as I just became unemployed. I hated that job, so it was also a good riddance. I still had got some cash, so I bought some booze:  a small Ballentines whiskey with Coca-Cola, and a 1000ml can of Faxe beer, light lager with 10% of alcohol. I drank those without any problem. After that, the LSA thing came into my mind  why not raise the inebriation with a new substance  yeah, I know now how stupid and ignorant was that in the past, but as I said, I didnt known much about these plants spiritual heaviness  - to the mix? So a bought 20 seeds at the local head shop, as its a totally legal thing here. I chewed all them totally unprepared, they had a very hard coat so the seeds also broke one of my teeth. After this, I decided to go home. I become very sleepy and sedated because of the booze, so I slept an hour on a bench waiting for the rural bus.     When I came up the bus and take a seat, I started to feel a very heavy and painful nausea, along with fever-like hotness. I am that kind of person who never asks for help, but it was so overwhelming that I had to ask a passenger to open a few window in front of me. Things due a ventilation got a little better. After a half hour of traveling, I came home. My pupils were extremely dilated, it was pretty scary for me for the first time. I have mild acoustical and visual hallucinations like hearing echoing metallic sounds, seeing the speed of the light differently - sounds crazy, but it was totally real for me then. I had got a heavy tactile sensation, physical euphoria during this time. I started to rub my feet and it was a beuatiful thing, and things that I hate like dog barking, radio stations, street sounds, etc:. was a totally happy and funny thing for me.  I started to make a phone call with a girl, and I said very nice and kinky things to her, but she didnt understood much of it as my voice become so soft and inaudible that It became painful to listen to me, so I closed the call. I was in a very euphoric and dreamy state for an hour ore more, lying on the bed, listening to very minimalistic, noisy electronic ambient music. My hearing became so sensitive that even the lowest volume was huge. I was in a good mood, but than, I had to go to take a piss, but nothing came due the vasoconstriction. This made me worried and ill, as I tried to urinate so many times and nothing came. I gone back to my room, it was very late afterning / early night now. After the previous euphoric state, things gone bad since that moment.     My heart beated so fast like never, and I get a strange panic attack, and I just had to say one sentence to start an negative emotional avalance on that trip: I will die because of a heartache, or I can prevent it by killing myself. After this, I \x84chained myself with my arms to the bed, and prayed for God that I will not ingest this material any more, just got me out of this suicidal thought loop. I came into a psychotic state, everything what was europhoric became scary and I felt an insane fear from darkness, so I kept the lights on the whole evening. I tried to vomit, but only a few seed coats come up with some alcoholic bowel acid.  After I vomited and got tired of my lying rage, I finally become tired and slept for a few hours. On the next day I barely got a hangover, but I have a lot of brown dots on my face.<!--as a sight of this substance overdose. --> After a research, now I know, that I didnt do any kind of recreational rules (set/setting, trip sitting, right mood), knowning the negative side effects what make me panic.<!--and that a psychedelic material should not been mixed with a depressant like alcohol.-->    To summerize this experience, there was some very nice body high for a few hours, interesting thoughts, and happiness, but after that the negative side effects made my panic, and I cried, vomited, and wanted to kill myself for the whole night. Also, 20 HBRW seeds was truly an overdose as much of the people recommend 5-8 seeds. Nearly 3 years after that, I tried LSA again with proper preparations and less dosage (100 Morning Glory seeds), and it was a much better experience than this."
109242,The Most Powerful Trip of My Life.,Birdboy,"May 21, 2018",Hawaiian Baby woodrose HBWR,"[Erowid Note:  The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid\'s \'heavy\' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    About 2 weeks ago I ingested 20 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. A little backround on my substance use is 4 LSD trips, 1 of those a pretty high dose. 1 morning glory trip, my first psychedelic experience :). 2 San Pedro trips, in which one of those I fell asleep during and another was a micro dose because I took it a few days later. 1 experience with 4-ACO-DMT which is and extrodenary drug, unfortunaly I didn\'t have a good setting until the end of it. And 1 2c-X trip, not sure what it was but it was a fun trip. Also countless times with weed, which I can\'t smoke now because of probation. And a few pills which I don\'t touch at all anymore. Some spice too by accident but fuck that stuff. Now I don\'t really know the timing of the effects but ill try to explain it in order.    So I chewed up 20 seeds, not really caring about the coating and around 30 min later I was begining to feel really sedative, I watched Dark Side of the rainbow, Wizard of Oz with Dark side of the moon in the backround, while coming up, while I also talked to some really close friends from back home. I just moved so I miss them alot but they helped comfort me. By this time I was already naked so I knew it was going to be a good trip. Also this is my first time tripping alone, so I was a little anxious but not until later in the trip.    Soon enough I was getting slight visuals but nothing really intense, I started walking around my apartment a little until I realized that I was begining to get into a thought loop, which last time that happened on 4 tabs of acid it made it a little scary so I retreated to my room. I listened to some classic rock like the beatles and Grateful Dead for awhile but then I got a sense something was behind me... Nothing was there visually but \'it\' was there.    This was when I was peaking and I got scared. In this experience I was looking for ego death, not knowing what to expect. A ignored it for a while but soon enough it was time. I was thinking alot about my life and how I got to this moment, thats when I realized it was time. This is when I puked... Alot... And I just couldn\'t let go and my friends wern\'t answering the phone so I was terified at this point. I turned on the Ego Death video by Psyched Substance which helped me let go. I was lying in my bed and I looked up at my light, and someone asked, \'are you ready now?\' We had a little converstation pretty much I was saying I was scared, but this is what I wanted and \'It\' said it was okay to be scared but when your ready close your eyes and I will take you.     So I turned on a playlist a perpared, turned off the lights, got in my bed, and let go. I remember feeling very sensitve to touch but then I felt nothing, I became everything. My visuals were these strings that were constantly morphing into these 5th dimensional shapes and it felt like my body were the visuals. I\'m not sure how long I was in there but I opened my eyes and called one of my best friends dylan and we talked for a little bit. I told him a loved him and all my friends and that I felt like they were my family, like we all have a deep spirtual connection that I have never felt about anyone. I cried a bit saying, I always thought there was something there but I was skeptical. I finally felt the warmth of \'god\' or whatever you want to call it I reailzed there is something in the universe connecting us all and it loves us. I realized Love is the most powerful feeling because it surpresses all others and goes past space and time. Across the Universe by the beatles makes so much more fucking sense.    Anyways I was coming down and I looked in the mirror and my head looked really funny. I talked to my self a bit more, or god or whatever. When I say I was talking to someone its not like a heard voices it was like a feeling of communication, probably from my sub-conciouss mine. I realized Death was behind me like litteraly the feeling, and now that a knew kinda what happened we became one and I no longer feared it, No longer will I constantly live my life fearing the unknown but excepting it with open arms.<!--Another thing if you wish to take these seeds I recommend a high does, but not during the day becuase I could barley walk and I probably looked hammered.-->    Alot of more things happened but nothing a could describe in words.<!--I just wish if anyone wants to try these be prepared because they will hit you like a train, And be ready to let go.-->                         ~Love Birdboy"
109761,The Insignificance of Pie,smurf,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Let me start off with the fact that at the time of this report, I am 21 years old, and most of my drug use is a thing of the past. I used to experiment with many substances from the ages 14-18. As of the last few years, I am only a daily cannabis smoker and a very occasional user of LSD (maybe 3 times in the last three years), as well as prescribed antidepressants.     This experience happened five years ago, but as someone who has heavily relied on reputable harm reduction websites to provide information and experience reports in the past for proper safety precautions, I feel it is my duty to submit my own reports in order to be of some help to any curious users.    I had met my new friend (we will call her \'H\') a few months before and told her about my drug use and experiences. She had never used drugs, but I seemed to really have an effect on her as she found a sudden interest for experimentation as well. Her first use of drugs was with me a week or so earlier when we tried salvia. I didn\'t care too much for it but she enjoyed it. One day she asked me if I had ever tried LSA. \'LSA? Don\'t you mean LSD?\' I asked, and she said \'No, LSA. It\'s different, but similar. It\'s the chemical in Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.\' She had found out about HBW seeds on her own research and purchased some right away online. I did some research to find out dosages and any other key information.    Some set/setting and personal info regarding this experience:  Up to this point in my life I had tried drugs such as spice, dxm, dmt, spice, salvia, prescription pills, lsd, and was a regular user of ecstasy, mdma, and cannabis. The experience took place at the beach and my bedroom for the most part, and some time was spent at a drug store.    I was excited, as I always was to try a new substance and had researched HBW seeds a bit prior to the occasion after she first told me about them.    When she arrived at my house, my parents were home. I snuck the mortar and pestle from the kitchen as I read one should grind the seeds into a paste. I also read that the seeds coating often induced much nausea and uneasiness so before grinding them, H and I spent much time scraping as much of the seeds outer-coating off with a knife & scissors. This took about 30-40 minutes just to scrape about 10 seeds. After my readings, I felt comfortable setting my dose at six seeds, and H decided on four seeds. After mashing the seeds, we ate the bitter mush. It was very earthy and hard to swallow.    Within the hour, H was throwing up in the bathroom and my parents were concerned, but I told them she had been feeling sick. She then felt much better and we decided to take a walk down to the beach which was just two blocks from my house. It was a cloudy and somewhat grey day. We sat upon some rocks as I texted \'A\', who was my boyfriend at the time. He was on his way to meet up with us and he had taken some Adderall as that was his drug of choice and he had not yet tried psychedelics. It was about an hour and a half after initial ingestion when I began to feel the subtle beginning effects. It was dreamy, like I was in a mental fog, but a content fog. There was no euphoria at this point, just subtle content calmness.     This experience happened so long ago that I do not remember most of what we conversed about but I do remember that at this point, H felt very happy and A was of course, very talkative. After maybe an hour at the beach, the dreaminess intensified and looking out into the ocean while the grey clouds covered the sky looked like a still painting. We began walking home and when we arrived, my parents were gone. I felt....weird. I\'m pretty sure H was in a very happy, heightened state, but I felt like I was walking in a dream, not fully grasping everything. We got in my room and H began playing on my laptop. She put some music on and was playing some sort of game I think. She was very entertained but I still felt odd. A and I were laying on my bed, as I couldn\'t really fathom any other possible options of what to do next. From there, I remember things got really uncomfortable for me. H started talking about food and what she wanted to eat and began insisting that pie was the answer to her food dilemma.    This really struck me in an odd way. My thoughts from this point began a loop that repeated over and over. Pie???? PIE?! What could pie possibly have to do with this moment in existence? PIE? I forgot pie even was a thing, so when it was brought up, it oddly caught me surprised. I thought pie was so.....irrelevant. I started getting agitated a little. H actually wanted to walk across the street to Rite Aid and buy pie. I kept telling her we would get pie later, and that in our current state, it wasn\'t a good idea. She retorted with \'I\'ll go by myself.\' I began to worry. She has to cross the street and she\'s on drugs and I wouldn\'t even be able to do that right now so how can she? I kept telling her it wasn\'t safe, and not to go, but she insisted. I felt like I just wanted to scream out \'MAKE IT STOP!\' because the effects of the seeds were becoming too paranoia and anxiety-inducing. After much talk about going to get pie, I finally said I\'d go with her. This was only because I really thought something bad would happen if she went alone. So H, A, and I walked across the street to the store, but this didn\'t end with an easy pie purchase. Instead, I entered a new kind of hell as H began browsing for all kinds of food, becoming interested in EVERYTHING. I felt paranoid, annoyed, scared, and simply DONE. I felt paranoid, annoyed, scared, and simply DONE. Time was stretching so slowly. I was in the store an eternity, I thought. What felt like lifetimes, could have really been 10 minutes, but I honestly don\'t know how long we spent in there. We finally returned home and H ate her feast of food while A and I continued lying on my bed for the majority of the comedown.    I enjoy profound, enlightening experiences with psychedelics, and my experience with HBW seeds did not provide such an experience, but instead left me feeling like I wasted my time. And so, five years later, I still have about four seeds remaining somewhere in a bag in my closet that I have not touched and do not wish to."
109774,Born Again,jmel_,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"This was my first experience with a hallucinogen besides diphenhydramine, so I was extremely curious as to what the field of psychedelics had to offer. The months leading up to this trip, I had been very eager to experience psychedelics such as acid or shrooms, but these chemicals were sadly never bestowed upon me. After some frustration, I decided to try the Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds to get my feet wet in psychedelics. Also, because they are legal and more readily available.    On the night of the trip, I was just coming down after smoking a few bowls, so my friends and I decided to break out the seeds. Worried about an inevitable confrontation with my parents later in the night, I decided to be cautious and only take 4 seeds. I scraped off the white fuzz, popped them in my mouth and chewed the hard seeds into a paste and swallowed. The seeds were bearable, but tasted like the smell of dirt, which turned my stomach a bit.    After about 20 minutes, my friends and I decided to \'take a walk\' and smoke a few bowls to negate the nausea expected with the seeds. We smoked, and after heading back inside, I was met with the leg cramps described in many of these trips. We had watched tv for about an hour, and I began to feel a slight drunkenness beginning to dull my brain. This was quite pleasant, comparable to a couple shots, and an almost opiate-like euphoria.    Another hour had passed, and I had to get picked up by my father. Upon returning home and getting in a ceremonial bath for the occasion, I was met with pure bliss, a complete sense of contentment in my own skin. My inhibitions had been erased, and I was at peace. At this point, some slight visuals had began, such as objects seeming to inhale and exhale. Then, suddenly, it happened. I was born again, and I was discovering my body, amazed at my limbs. My skin was orgasmic to touch, as I rubbed all over my naked body like an idiot. I was having memories of experiences that I was never a part of. I could envision a situation, and I was suddenly there. This experience consisted of a lot less seeing things with my eyes, but instead I saw things with my mind.    I drained the bathtub, and retired to the living room, where I laid on the couch. My brother entered, and we engaged in deep conversation, my mind and body being vastly stimulated throughout. I spent the rest of the night just swimming in the euphoria, until I finally went to bed, and dreamt extremely vivid dreams. The next morning I was a bit hungover, but this subsided later in the day. Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience.<!--and I would highly recommend this dosage for first time users. --> I barely experienced the negative effects, and I had a wonderful trip that stimulated my body and soul. I plan to use the seeds again, but at a much higher dose to experience the full effect."
111277,Unpleasant Experience Difficulty Breathing,stoner,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Salvia divinorum,"I had been interested in trying HBW seeds as they were cheap and easy to procure legally.     I decided to just chew them and hold the crushed seed gunk in my mouth for 20-25 minutes as it was reported that the sublingual method of taking the seeds removed the nausea frequently experienced.    Since it was suggested to start with a low dose to first gauge the effects, for the first time I ingested 4 seeds. I took care that I did not eat the last 3-4 hours so as to avoid vomiting it up.    First effects were felt after about an hour. There was a strange sensation in my body and it was mostly intense euphoria with a body high. At this point I smoked a joint as a precaution to not get nauseated. This I felt added to the effects, it was like there were vibrations running in my body to the top of my head. Music felt good but there no visuals or distorted perception.    The peak lasted till about 2-3 hours after which they subsided till I took another 2 seeds at the 4 hour mark. This did not add much to the experience which I should have anticipated as tolerance to LSA is said to build up within hours.  I was eager to try a higher dose as it felt like I was just scratching the surface of the experience.    The next week I took 8 seeds the same way- chewing them up and spitting it out after 20 minutes. At this point, I have to mention that I was a bit thoughtless and overdid the part that I needed to have an empty stomach. I had a very small dinner and intended to ingest the seeds in the morning but wound up waking late, around 1P.M and was a bit weak as a result.I also tend to not drink water much and was probably dehydrated.     This time around, I decided to lay off the weed till a bit longer to see what LSA felt like without it.    I took the seeds at 2 P and 2.5 hours passed without any visible effects except slight discomfort in the stomach, at which point I packed a bowl with weed (which also had a small amount of chilean holly, mugwort, wormwood and calea as I mixed some left over herbs with the weed) and smoked it.    I began to feel the effects of the weed and settled down for the LSA trip. But this time I began feeling extremely lethargic with erratic thoughts and my motor functions were affected for some reason. Maybe the other herbs played some part for this unpleasant feeling.    I was also very hungry and tried eating some food but ended up throwing half of it away. I retired to my room and stayed for an hour or so in this restless state.     It had now been a solid 5 hours since taking the seeds. Now I had just gotten my shipment of salvia leaves, which I had never tried before.    This turned out to be a mistake. I packed a bowl in my new bong and took some fast pulls keeping the smoke in my lungs for ~30 seconds. I felt the salvia \'pull\' I had read about and fell down back first on my bed behind me. At this point it is difficult to explain but I felt waves lapping up on my chest and like I was not myself but some random characters I had made up in my mind, but this was for a short duration.    Now the worst part of the trip began. My breathing became extremely slow and I felt like my body was not getting enough oxygen. My thoughts became even more jangled and I found it difficult to move my body. I even thought I might have to go to the hospital at one point.    This hell lasted for 2.5 hours (it was around 9:30P I think) and I tried sleeping it off.     Finally my breathing slowly returned to normal and I had a short nap for an hour. I had a lot of negative thoughts and generally felt bad on the inside for some time before finally becoming normal at 11P. I ate some food, did my laundry and sat down to write this report.    I don\'t know when I will try these seeds again but will take more care for the preparation (definitely not smoking salvia with HBWR!)    Though my 2nd attempt too a turn for worse, I want to atleast feel like I did the first time and will maybe try 5 seeds next without   foolishly not eating for a long time and being properly hydrated."
84535,Pure Bliss!,Girlfriend&I,"May 7, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Ginger,"My girlfriend and I took 4 of these seeds each. We de-husked them very carefully and rinsed them in cold water. Then we took   a large teaspoon of ginger powder, to combat any nausea we were told we might encounter.     I started feeling tingling starting at my feet and gradually moving up to my crotch. The feeling was electric. We both started to feel very blissful. All our senses were enhanced touch, taste, smell and hearing. No visuals, no nausea just a state of pure bliss and great love. Touching was electrifying, the fruit we ate was delicious. All music we played was great. We melted into each other for 4 hours, totally beautiful! Then we had a \'tea beak\' and made some food, it tasted great!. The next 4 hours were also blissful we went to bed and felt warm, close and all loved up. Probably the best experience of my life. Awesome brilliant Both of us are experienced psychonauts....set and setting folks!!!!"
110960,Heaven and Hell but Worth It,DayTripper,"Mar 27, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I am a very experienced tripper... did practically everything. Shrooms, Acid, Ayahuasca, DMT the whole show. For this reason I didn\'t follow the recommended dose of 4 seeds and ended up chewing 8 of these big boys. After 30 minutes I started to feel very sedated like after taking a natural kind of heavy tranquilizer. It felt very pleasant and dreamy with a kind of pressure in my forehead. Then came intense nausea, tried to vomit but it didn\'t work. So I sat on the couch and listened to a guided meditation.     At the 3 hour mark it felt like a very powerful LSD trip except with a huge body load, (intense nausea, high vasoconstriction, stomach cramps and extreme thirst). Thanks to the guided meditation I was able to leave my body for a couple of hours during which I experienced complete ego death. Somewhat scary but at the same time there was an underlying peace and understanding that all was good. I honestly don\'t ever recall having such a complete (yet aware) ego death on any other psychedelic (even DMT).    After this two hour period was over however I started hearing weird sounds from outside (it was probably just distant thunder or wind in the trees). For some reason I convinced myself that the world was about to end. The apocalypse was imminent... some kind of nuclear disaster, war or natural calamity was about to hit the earth. At that point I started to have a panic attack and found myself pacing back and forth in my apartment. The panic got worse by the minute and at a certain point I was 100% sure I was going to die because of some weird allergic reaction to the seeds. I felt an extreme thirst that no amount of water was able to quench. Then I remembered reading of someone who had died because they drank too much water during an MDMA trip and I literally thought I was having an emergency type situation.    Long story short I ended up calling an ambulance and spent the night in the hospital with the doctors and nurses practically laughing at me (they knew I was just having a panic attack) a very humiliating experience to say the least.<!--I would really suggest following the recommended dosage and having a trip sitter close by if possible. -->  What seemed like a beautiful trip turned into a nightmare which I probably could have avoided had I taken just 4 - 5 seeds.<!--Still I would highly recommend HBWR... especially if you are a spiritual seeker you will probably benefit a lot from this kind of trip. But do yourself a favour: be safe! Peace.-->"
26907,Pure Ecstasy,bluegreen,"Mar 9, 2018",H.B.Woodrose,"A little anxious, I let soak three seeds crushed of A. nervosa in a little vodka during five hours. In the late afternoon, I drank the whole on a empty stomach... Fortunately, I took only three seeds because what followed is beyond any description.     The plant nicely took me by the hand and with lot of softness brought the answers to me to all my existential questions. I left to walk in surrounding nature, sat down in a field under a splendid sky with a beautifull sunset... and I can resume what followed by only one word...ecstasy.....    pure ecstasy in front of the incredible beauty of a thing what we do never see but what is however beside us... The universe, our world, in a calm and a indescribable silence. The mask fell... finally.    I realized at what point my friends were important for me for the joy and the laughter that we share together. I saw them ravelling in front of me with a superb clearness. I saw each one of them with their particular characteristics, their concern, their qualities, their defects and I understood instantaneousely how to help them on their path of life...     The night came and I returned to the house surprised by the quality of what happened to me... the spirit was gone down on my poor person and clarified me with a soft and warm interior light...    Lastly, I returned at home purified, after years on the road. I lit candles and incense, put soft music until the early morning in one atmosphere of peace and meditation as I had\'nt known from a long time ago.     There will be a before and  a after...   I am in deep veneration in front of the power of these plants and I will be always infinitely grateful for what they brought to me. They deserve our respect and they should not be taken with lightness... In the morning I went to see my ipomaea violacea flourishing, and each blue flower seemed to laugh at the good joke that their tropical cousin had played to me... I will not do it again before a long time but from now, I know that I have an ally soft and quiet but incredibly powerful."
61877,Just Another Ant In The Colony,Perry,"Jul 14, 2017",H.B. Woodrose,"At about 9:45 in the morning two days ago, I crushed up 15 Woodrose seeds. I put them in cold water with a squirt of lemon juice with the intentions of doing the no barf method. After about 20 minutes I felt nothing, so I figured I got a bad strand of seeds. Silly me, I decided to just swallow the seeds.    I fired up a few computer games to kill time before the stuff kicked in, however it became hard to concentrate and my stomach began to get upset.    From here on out I am just going to copy and post what I wrote while coming down from the substance.    I was by myself, but I felt my preparations could keep me strong.     About 20 minutes after consumption my stomach turned topsey turvey and I began to feel nauseous, however I did not feel \'sick\'. About 40 minutes in I puked up everything in my stomach, but after doing so I can\'t convey the emotion I felt. I felt as though I overcame fucking death, and I turned the puking into an entity at which I could insult and triumph over it like a Trojan would to an enemy after a victory. For about an hour I was bed ridden and could do nothing but watch TV.    I did not go into this experience wanting to \'get fucked up\'. I went into it wanting to grow mentally, and I believe I took a journey and am satisfied with what I achieved. There was a moment where I had a feeling of pure insignificance. I felt that the seeds I took symbolized nature as a whole and it was punishing me for my ignorance. I felt that what I did was an abuse of another drug, and that I could not handle the truth it was to bring to me. I was quickly slipping away and I wanted to just give in to nature\'s power. I tried to sleep but nature was always there, destroying me, stripping me of my self, and reveling to me that I was just another ant in a colony. No matter how hard I tried to give up I could not, and nature was always there to break me down. I tried listening to music but nature was still there. No matter how hard I tried to think, I could not think of anything positive.    I really wanted to reach out to someone but I did not know how. C was kind enough to come all the way out and pick me up. Before Cs arrive I had a lot of time to burn. I was still feeling that the nature entity was destroying me, but slowly a ray of help came inside me. I kept explaining to myself what in my conscious mind I thought was good, and that seemed to help a little. I got in my hot tub and looked around. Awe struck I finally came to grips with nature. The sunlight was baring down on me, the wind flying through air the and a squirrel on the fence near me. The joy and euphoria that overcame me is beyond explanation. I was thankful for everything, because nature was not destroying me, I was part of nature, I had been destroying myself. I also touched upon time, which seems to be a center of attention for me on psychedelics.     Think about this, if one could change the rate at witch they perceive the world around them, does one see time as slower? So if one perceives a ball flying at them at a much faster rate then another person, then does that ball go slower for that one person? Hard to write, please talk to me about it.    I realized how much I loved my mom and dad, and felt bad that my room was messy so I went and cleaned it.  I feel that from now on I need to make more of a commitment to my parents, because they commit so much to me. Parents give so much care, it is our place to return it.     A lot more happened today, I went out with some friends, battled more nausea, came back home. I feel fine now, no side effects, maybe a little withdrawn. Talked with my mom so on. I feel very personal right now, and there is a lot I can\'t talk about because its still being formulated. One thing that really touched me was the power of nature. Nature is not just a subject we lump a bunch of stuff with. Nature is in all of us. There is an entity within us all that never manifests itself. It stays hidden and we suppress it. I say look to your natural side. Understand who YOU are. I found the side that is always knocking me down and I overcame it, I think it would help a lot of you to do the same.    One last thing, my friend just did this stuff, and he tripped for the whole day and well into the night. He could still be tripping for all I know. This stuff is powerful!"
105408,Communing With the Whales,Talen,"Nov 21, 2016","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis, Amanita muscaria & Mushrooms","So, this is two years after said experience but I feel compelled to report anyway...    I\'m experienced with psychoactive materials such as, Salvia, Mushrooms, BromoDragonfly, Amanita Muscaria, Alchohol, LSA containing seeds, Cappi Vine, Syrian Rue, Datura, Brugmansia, Yopo, Vaporized DMT and copius amounts of Cannabis in every form imaginable. Even a horrible experience with synthetic Cannabinoids and DXM... Respect for these substances is essential to safe explorations!    I am a military veteran of two tours in Iraq so bravado sometimes gets the better of me... Thankfully not this time!    The experience started in Eastern Colorado on a weekend off of work and all my co-workers wanted to go bowling/drinking the Booze. (I\'m pretty biased towards drinking, being supported by the establishment/big brother/corporations... Dumb dumb drug... I digress). I agree but not before taking some Valerian Root 1750 mg, Skullcap 1500mg, Passion Flower 1000mg, Phenibut 750mg, Picamilon 250mg, Blue Lotus Extract 1 gram, 4 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds Chewed and swallowed and rolled a joint laced with Amanita muscaria Extract (adds a little extra to cannabis an combats the cotton mouth!) Cannabis buds were being continuously smoked allnight (gotta love Colorado!) All this took place at roughly 7:00 p.m..    7:30 P.M.- Arrival at the bowling alley.    Everyones in a very jovial mood (Cannabis!). I am feeling slight nausea but nothing the Kratom and Cannabis deadly duo cannot take care of. Starting to feel rushes of energy (Kratom) and becoming quite talkative. I feel as if enveloped by a warm field of static electricity, Very nice. All the stresses of the week and anxiety are just melting away. Takes puffs of Hash out out of a vaporizer pen (tastes lovely!).     9:00- Ok.. Tired of the Bowling alley.    Wow ok, I was having fun at first but now the Hawaiian woodrose seeds have kicked in (also every other substance consumed!). The seeds make me super aware of patterns and the subtle underlying energies of places. Raucous drunken laughter and dirty jokes really don\'t mix well with deep insightful abstract thought processes... Neither stumbling steps and long spaced out stares into empty space, and I really had both going on. People kept asking about my wellbeing seeing that I had only been drinking water and didnt appear intoxicated... Until speaking or walking. I felt extreme euphoria, warmth and downright groovy. Except the drunk rednecks interfering with my vibes. So I decide to smoke my Sneaky laced Amanita/cannabis joint around the back. Well co-workers followed and asked to partake with me. I explained the contents of said joint but they still wanted to try... Everyone agreed that the taste isnt so good but loved the drool inducing extract.    This made me almost manic and the thoughts and words were flowing like a river! This conversation led to that and so we all decided to leave the bowling alley and eat some Magnificent Mushrooms (cubensis).    11:00-? There she blows captain! The great white whale!    Sorry about the time frame. I honestly had lost all reference of time by now...    So our group returned to my house to \'meet the magic (mushroom)\' there were 6 people back at my place and five of em were talking crap about my beloved mushroom... Saying it probably wouldnt amount to much anyway... So at first I was going to deny them the experience but they kept pushing me. (My inhibitions were extremely lowered by now...) So I gave them the ultimatum that they could imbibe the sacrament but only at the dose I handed them. They accepted. So I weighed out 4 grams for each of them. (At first they wanted a 1/2 gram each to enhance some video game playing, I thought that this would be disrespectful to the mushroom spirit. Hence the 4 gram dose.) They wondered about interactions with alchohol and I told them to expect nausea and confusion but Psilocin can and most definitly will overpower feelings of drunkeness. They all dosed and I bravely (insanely?) weighed out 6 grams and dosed as well. I went downstairs to gather my singing bowl and other assorted shamanic gear.     11:30? Guess. Psychedelic pandemonium    Well as I am grabbing my tripping toys I hear yelling and commotion upstairs. Uh oh! I go to see whats going on. My friend is punching walls and very upset with me. I ask \'whats wrong bro?\' He starts flinging accusations that I am being unsocial and abandoning them all to the trip. I dont really understand whats going on at first then it dawns on me... We are starting to come up! \'Whoa my friend, no abandonment here! Just gathering more weed and shiny bowls and feathers and crystals an such!\'. \'Oh! Ok\' he says and breaks into a massive grin. He turns on a video game after this and all I hear is gunfire and explosions... Ugh. Well two of our fellow trippers dont like the vibes so decide to walk home and proceed to watch Lion King on repeat all night. 30 something year old brothers scared into watching Disney all night. Psychedelics are curious, no?  There were six, now down to four.  The comeup was extremely fast for me this time! Exponential liftoff! I decided to browse some Alex Grey art books but as I turned the pages I started having the strangest feeling. That I wasnt supposed to do this... That that was his trip, not mine. It was uncanny and forceful, almost a telepathic and heartfelt NO! Along with this I had the compulsion to go into the restroom. By this point we were all pretty fried. But mainly a supreme body feeling and pretty moderate color enhancement. Lots of pinks and yellows, much like adjusting the T.V. screen. Strange that I didnt percieve breathing walls and carpet movement like I usually do.    12:XX? Stairway to heaven, Realisation    I go into the bathroom and my breath is just taken away. On the white ceiling is a golden fractal stairway seemingly leading strait to the gods! Very organic, like a cross section of a conch shell only breathing and growing into infinity. Imagine the inside of the most spectacular cathedral dome imaginable. All the cracks in the paint were flaking off and growing nonstop, similar to the day/night transition of the movie Silent hill, only really beautiful and engrossing. All of the sudden this familiar feeling washes over me... What is it, hmmm. Oh shit its my ego beginning to come under attack! I wasnt really prepared for that. It had happened to me before but never as strong as it was this time. Like an inescapable steamroller come to crush me out of existence. \'SHIT SHIT SSSSHHHHHIIIITTTT! Not now I begged and pleaded. I prayed to whatever force would listen. Only the mushroom spirit answered. \'You asked for this, to see my true power, now here it is. Experience awe and pay attention and learn!\' Well damn I thought here goes nothing or everything. So I walked back into the living room. I said \'sorry everyone, I\'ve gone and over did it. I am about to be FUCKED up! But dont worry it will pass...\' I was met with stares of trepidation from my three fellow travellers. The video game had been turned off because they said it was making them think that a S.W.A.T. Team was about to bust in the door.     1:00? Consciousness Fractured and Communing with the Whales    We decided to load a bowl of Cannabis to help with the morose atmosphere. It seemed like eternity but not a one of us was capable of loading that bowl! Eventually we gave up... Probably wouldn\'t have helped anyway. My friends were having pretty profound conversations that is normally absent from their normal talk. I was fighting the slippery slope of ego dissolution and losing badly! Then all of the sudden I had an epiphany! \'Stop fighting it and just let go!\' I told my friends that I was going to go with it and to try to remain calm. They laughed and agreed and turned on The Simpsons. After I accepted my fate everything got much better! Even for my fellow travellers! I think that my anxiety was flowing into them... Poor souls! Laughter started coming in gales from everyone! I had felt like a trapped and cornered animal earlier. Now I KNEW that all was well. I kept telling them that I was going CRAZY! That made everyone laugh really really hard and they would say \'no bro, you aren\'t going crazy!\'. \'Oh yes I am! It\'s GREAT HA HA HA HA!\'     By this point I couldn\'t even walk. I could only kind of slither around on the hardwood floor. I guess that would be an accurate description... Soon I could not even sit upright. Gravity seemed to be getting extremely heavy. I begged my friend to hand me a bottle of water (starting to get really hot and parched, sort of uncomfortable bodily sensations). He set it in front of my outstretched hand (I was on my side just unable to get up.) Well that damned bottle just slowly rolled away out of reach. The wooden slats of the floor were starting to look less than normal, more like undulating snakes or different colors of paint all swirling together. Very ocean like. Turbulent waters. In fact all of reality was distorting and morphing like jello or Salvador Dali paintings. Archaic letters and runes similar to Aramaic or Hebrew were scrolling across every flat surface. Living matter was vibrating so fast as to make the edges blurry or fractalized. Living matter was vibrating so fast as to make the edges blurry or fractalized. Time wasn\'t even in existance. I was hearing whispers and strange echoes everywhere. It was far too much to comprehend and quite nauseous to say the least, so I closed my eyes.     In this dark realm I realized that my conciousness had fractured into multiple perspectives. One was imobilised on the floor clinging to any form of existance that it could. Another was listening to my friends converse and watch T.V.. And yet another was reviewing life decisions and memories in glorious detail. One more was responding to my friends inquiries to my wellbeing with moans and grunts an groans. Ha! But this other aspect of me was experiencing a strange cold pressure... I tried focusing on this one. The more I focused the more the other aspects fell into background noise. I felt cold but comfortable in here. All darkness but I felt presences around me and kept hearing a strange sound. I started taking deep slow breaths in and mooooaaaannning the sound out. After several iterations of making the sound I heard my friend really far in the distance say \'he is ok, just tripping really hard\' reassured that my friends were still watching over my body I opened my \'Eyes\' and was taken aback! I found myself in an aquatic locale surrounded by gargantuan creatures! I was very disoriented at first but came to the conclusion that I was floating in the midst of a sleeping pod of whales! I moaned out in excitement and a few eyes started opening around me. I moaned more and the rest started waking up. More moans and the whole pod surrounded me curiously rubbing against me. Euphoria and excitement went through the roof! The whales were trying to calm me down with soothing calls and squeals.     This state was similar to a lucid dream but far more vivid! I could feel the caresses of my fellow pod members! Their deep resounding calls imparted far more information than I ever thought possible! Eventually I worked out that the pod had discerned my \'alien\' nature. They sang me back to a deep comfortable placid sleep like state. Songs of oneness and deep understanding.        All of the sudden my eyes jolted open and I jumped up with a start! My friends were so startled! Ha! The said \'whoa man! What the fuck just happened?!?\' I said. \'What a fuckin TRIP man! I was with the whales!\'. They responded \'No, man. You were singing like a whale, really LOUDLY! Just like one on the Animal Planet!\'. <!--I\'m telling you erowid readers... -->    This was my most awesome trip ever! I was brimming with energy and felt on top of the world. I couldnt stop making strange vibrational sounds though. I was tripping like \'normal\' now. Breathing carpet fast flowing thoughts and all. The vibrations made the visuals strikingly more animated. We just hung out smoking Cannabis and Hash until the sun came up.    This was the most amazing experience I\'ve ever had with mushrooms. Hands down! I was psychedelically sated for over a year after this. Also strangely my recurring Cluster and Migraine headaches have dissapeared... I have been free of symptoms for close to two years now... Hmm.    Please be careful and respect these things. We have only scratched the surface of existance. Keep searching. And spread love and compassion whenever and wherever you can!"
96706,Horrifying Intensity at the Camp,MottTheHoople,"Aug 18, 2013",H.B. Woodrose,"This report deals with an experience I had on this very potent psychedelic.  I did many stupid things this particular day and I want to write this report as a caution to anyone interested in exploring the legal psychoactives available in the U.S.    It was the summer of \'07, I had been around the block with drugs enough times to know where the good parking spaces were at that point.  I started out with marijuana at age 16, which totally changed my perspective on life for the better.  Over the years I had used Mushrooms, Cacti, DXM, Morning Glory, Ecstasy (which I became quite addicted to for a six-month period when I was 19), 2C-1, 2C-E, Cocaine, Crack, Opium, various Benzos and Painkillers, Ritalin, Addarall, Meth, AMT, DiPT, 5-meo-MiPT (see my experience report \'The Mind Numbing Psychedelic?\'), and probably various others which I can\'t think of right now.  And during that time I had fallen madly in love with a bad woman, probably the most potent \'high\' and worst \'crash\' of them all.  I also developed a stubborn addiction to Cigarettes and Alcohol, which I am still trying to rid myself of...    When I was 17 I had made an extract of Morning Glory seeds using the polar-nonpolar method to ease the nausea.  I believe I felt something from that but it was very subtle, maybe a + or even a +/- on the Shulgin scale.  This time, five years later I decided to make an extract of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose and wanted there to be no mistake about potency.  I think I used about fifteen seeds and the extract went well, leaving me with a few capsules of what I call \'psychedelic birdseed\'.    At the time I had lived on my own for a few years and was getting ready to go back to college, so my dad suggested I move into his basement for a few months to save up money.  The morning of the experience, I took some newly purchased camping gear, food, black tea, a harmonica, a notebook and pen, loaded up the car and drove about sixty miles north to a beautiful state park.  I had also brought along about a quarter bottle of rum and some weed, just in case the extract didn\'t work.    When I got to the park, I found a nice secluded area, set up my tent, made a cup of tea and ingested the capsules.  I believe I also took some Dramamine or something to keep me from throwing up... Very stupid idea!    Within about thirty minutes, the effects began to manifest and I knew within an hour that I had taken way too much.  My tent was beginning to become covered with caterpillars and spiders, which were really there, not a hallucination; however the bugs\' gyrations sent intensely frightening shadows into the tent.  I opened the front of the tent and saw that the forest was breathing and colors were taking on a \'Van Gogh\' type effect, not to dissimilar to good mushrooms.      I also became very ill and attempted to vomit, to no avail.  The \'losing my mind\' feeling was in full, FULL force.  It was like tripping as hard as you\'ve ever tripped and having the flu at the same time.  I don\'t know how long I was there but it was probably early afternoon.  I decided I needed help, so I left my gear in the woods, walked to the trailhead where I had parked my car and started slowly driving out of the state park.  I know Erowid will insert their stock warning here, but it bears repeating... Driving intoxicated or tripping is extremely dangerous and can hurt or kill people.  Don\'t do it, EVER!  [Erowid does not condone or support operating any vehicles while under the influence of any substance]    When I got to the interstate, I decided I was overdosing on LSA and I probably should get my stomach pumped.  There is a town with a hospital right off the highway, halfway between the park and my dad\'s house, so I figured if I felt confident by the time I got that far, I would go all the way home, but if not I would go to the emergency room.    The drive home was a nightmare.  I was not swerving like a drunk or anything and I saw a few cops who obviously didn\'t think I was driving poorly either.  But I kept feeling like I was being pushed closer and closer to the ground, as if my tires were flat, and I pulled over several times to check the tire pressure, which of course was fine.  I also ditched the booze and weed at this point on the side of the road.    I tried to turn on the radio to give me something to hold onto, some grounding in reality... When I flipped it on, the Allman Brothers\' \'Whipping Post\' was blaring and as you can imagine, it was evil!  As if Satan were playing the guitar and organ.  It crushed my head and I couldn\'t take it.  I drove the rest of the way home in silence, watching the clouds dance, the sky change colors and repeating to myself over and over \'You\'re gonna make it, this is a drug and its effects will eventually end\'.    When I got home I went inside and my dad was standing there, perplexed.  He thought I was going camping for a couple of days and wanted to know why I was home so soon.  He tried to tell me some information he had just learned about the college I had been accepted to, which is in Alaska.  He was very excited and happy that I was pulling my life together and started showing me a map and talking to me with rainbows flying out of his head.  My dad\'s a short guy, so am I, but while tripping he looked like a midget!  I told him, \'I\'m sick as hell, I need to go lay down.\' and went down to the basement to ride out the horrible trip.      In my dad\'s dark basement, the audio hallucinations began to kick in heavily.  There is a part in the J. Geils Band song \'Wild Man\' where their singer, Peter Wolf goes \'Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!\' over and over again in an urgent, almost demonically possessed voice.  I had only that one section of the song stuck in my head on loop, the \'yeah, yeah, yeah\'s pounding in my brain and screaming directly into my face.  Eventually that subsided and was replaced by the one growling low-pass filter synthesizer sound from a Tool song off Lateralus.  Also extremely intense and unstoppable.  The ceiling was swirling and I still felt very, very physically sick.  My dad left to visit my mom, who was in a nursing home at the time suffering from Multiple Sclerosis.  I could tell by his sighs as he got ready to leave that he was pissed off.    It was well over 18 hours before I felt even remotely normal again and 24 hours or so before I could eat anything.  I had a bowl of cereal and stroked my dad\'s pet rabbit.  When he asked me what had happened, I told him I was drinking Kava Kava tea to try and meditate in the woods when I got really sick.  I\'m sure he knew I was full of shit.      Anyway, a month or two later, I packed up my stuff, got on the road and drove all the way to Alaska, which was probably the best thing I\'ve done for myself in my entire life.  I realized while I was slowly coming down from the trip that I had very nearly blew my chance at moving to this wonderful state and finishing my education.    So to recap, here are the mistakes which made this trip the horrible experience which it became.  First, I grossly overestimated the amount of material I should take.  Because I wanted to make sure I had a +++ experience, I ended up taking way too much.  Also, taking the Dramamine was a bad idea.  If you feel like you took too much of something and need to vomit, you have to be able to!  I drove, which is the worst thing anyone can do on drugs, and honestly shouldnt be done sober either, cars are bad news.  I took this trip alone, with nobody to watch over me, in an unfamiliar setting, in a park where rangers may have caught me and I ended up leaving all my brand new camping gear there.  I went back for it a few days later and of course, it was gone.  I lied to my father, which obviously is something most young drug users have to do.  My dad and I have a good relationship nowadays but we both put a lot of strain on each other back then.  I also panicked about the car tires and set myself up for possible arrest if a cop had stopped to help me.      Im not going to say \x91dont trip, but for me it was not really worth it.  I continued doing drugs for a few years here and there and even grew my own shrooms in college, which were very potent.  Many of my experiences were very good, but many were difficult.  Today I stick with weed, and as I said earlier, I am trying to quit drinking.  If you are a somewhat unstable person like myself, have a moody personality (Im a cancer) or an addictive personality, then drugs just arent where its at... Especially psychedelics.     I know if you wanna trip, youre gonna trip, but please be careful.  Do it with a trusted friend, and do not, under any circumstances get into a vehicle.  Put your car keys in a safe deposit box or something.  And always, always err on the side of caution when it comes to dosage.  You can always take more, you cant take the drugs out of your bloodstream once theyre in there\x85  Peace!"
77264,Clear Distortion,Forrest,"Oct 26, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"Ive been experimenting with psychedelics for a few months now and decided that H.B. Woodrose was worth a shot seeing as how theyre cheap and many people enjoy the effects.       I ordered seeds off the internet and my friend and I chose a Friday evening to take them. I had eaten a quarter of a pretty potent hash brownie so I was already pretty on by the time we got around to the seeds. At about 6:30 PM we each ate 7 seeds, simply popping them in our mouths and crunching them up without prior preparation. We decided to walk down the beach while waiting for them to kick in. After about 20 minutes I noticed a slight change in my vision and a peculiar body feeling. There was a faint sort of veil over everything in my range of vision and when I closed my eyes I could see some moving shapes and colors. My friend reported that he was feeling a bit spacey. My stomach began to feel a bit off too so we decided to smoke a bowl on the beach. Afterwards we walked towards my other friends coffee shop to get some drinks. The body feeling remained more or less the same for most of the walk but I noticed that time seemed to be moving very slowly because the 30 or so minutes it took us to get there seemed like at least an hour.       About halfway through the walk my friend started bugging me for more seeds because he wasnt feeling it so he took another 2 seeds while I took an extra 4 for myself. This brought my total to 11 seeds and 9 for him. By the time we reached the coffee shop and I got my drink I was feeling sicker by the minute. Nausea began to creep into my stomach and I was so tired I felt as if I was going to fall asleep right there. My tripping buddy said he felt fine apart from being really buzzed so I figured it must have been those two extra seeds and the large mocha freeze I drank. My two friends wanted to go to my house and finish off the MJ but I told them I just wanted to go to bed.   \t    It was about 9:00 when we began the long walk home and I was sure I was going to throw up. On top of the nausea I was getting painful cramps in my abdomen and my mouth felt extremely odd as if my tongue was swelling. Once I got home it was about 9:30 and I went straight to my room and flopped down on my bed while my trip buddy used the bathroom. When I closed my eyes I realized that the colors and shapes I had noticed earlier had become much brighter and clearer and were quite a bit of fun to watch. So after giving my stomach a minute to rest my friend and I decided to smoke anyway to see if I couldnt intensify the hallucinations a bit. So we went out back and packed a huge bowl and I stayed for about 2/3 of it and left the rest for him.     \t  I went back inside, stripped down to my boxers, turned the lights of and put on some Shpongle while I lay on my bed enjoying the kaleidoscopic colors and geometric shapes dance before my eyes, they seemed to move and bounce and spin in time to the music. I was having a very good time when I heard a noise in my backyard and went out there to find my trip buddy who I thought had gone home 20 minutes before staggering around muttering to himself. When he saw me he said I found it! I really found it!       I thought to myself Jeez, hes really fucked up, I cant let him walk home like this so I invited him in and told him to be quiet cause my brother was asleep downstairs. He collapsed on my bedroom floor and started mumbling something about how he had become god and he could see and feel everything in the universe. He would start to get very excited and begin yelling and raving and I told him to shut up and he would apologize profusely and say something like You dont understand, you are my son, my disciple.       Every 20 seconds or so he would ask me what time it was and Id tell him and hed refuse to believe me because he said it felt like years had passed since he last asked me. Then he started holding his breath for as long as he could and then scream Im dead my son! Im dead!      I eventually got him off the floor and made him watch the visualizer on itunes which he seemed to enjoy very much and I made some instant noodles and we sat there for about an hour listening to Shpongle and eating. At one point I wanted to experience what my buddy was experiencing so I smoked another bowl by myself but it only made me feel slightly more loaded.       At around 11:20 I walked my buddy home and returned to my house to try to go to sleep. I couldnt sleep because the hallucinations were still pretty intense and the stomach cramps began to return. My throat felt as if it was expanding and contracting slowly and my jaw kept locking up making me very uncomfortable. I laid there for about 15 minutes before getting back up and putting the music back on.       At 12:30 I was still pretty fucked up and my pupils were pretty dilated. Then without warning, I started experiencing very powerful, very weird sexual urges, like crazy kinky fetish stuff that had never even crossed my mind before. Just the fact that I had such an intense urge to do these things scared me a little. But just as I was about to go get out some oil and candles the desire disappeared and was replaced by a deep sadness that lasted about 20 minutes. I tried to get back to bed but my jaw continued to clench up and the hallucinations distracted me.      Over the next hour I had dramatic mood swings that took me from depressed, to ecstatic, to horny again, to confused, then back to depressed. I kept having the desire to do very bizarre things like run around in my backyard with no clothes on. At one point I wound up in the bathtub naked and crying. At around 3:20 AM I finally calmed down and fell asleep.       I woke up the next day at 2:00 PM with a headache and a weird tingly sensation in my legs that made me pretty wobbly and I wasnt quite back to 100% until about 5:00.       Overall it was a very bizarre experience, both good and bad at the same time. I think Id like to try them again in the near future but I\'ll take them by myself and just stay home for the duration of the trip. I may smoke more too because Im curious to see what my tripping buddy was talking about."
94060,Scary,wackojacko,"Feb 8, 2012",H.B. Woodrose,"We bought these after my friend tried them, we bought 50 as about 10 of us tried them all at once at my friends flat (big mistake). Firstly we made the flat really comfy, and calm and started to watch a film after ingesting the seeds. The effects started with me wanting to touch things, my pupils then became dilated and I needed to get up and walk around. After pacing up and down the corridor I came back into the room where everyone was. I don\'t remember the next half an hour, but I remember listening to music in a friends room. By this time everyone had come up. I found that I needed the be in a quiet place, which was dark and calm, firstly I tried the living room, where a friend was laid in silence. This was really pleasant for around 15mins until a lot of people entered the room.    I then started to feel bad, I knew what I wanted (peace and quiet) but I couldn\'t have it. I ended up pacing the corridor again when a friend started having a panic attack, this made the trip get worse and worse, I felt like I was descending. I scrambled into my sober friends room and tried to calm myself down. I succeeded at first but then my friend who was having a panic attack entered the room, my friend was in tears and claimed to be finding it hard to breathe. I ran out the room and was sick several times, this helped my negative feelings and I entered back into the bed where I was laid after my friend who was panicking had left. I laid in the bed for what must have been two hours, after this I ventured back out and found that everything had calmed down and there were less people about.    I ended up back at my room and began to chill out, I found it hard to sleep. I woke up in the night tripping sometimes. For the past two days I have found that my pupils dilate, and I loose my sense of balance, this scares me senseless. In the end I wish I had never taken these seeds, I will not be taking any drugs for a while now. Please heed this warning. I hope in a few days I feel the same as I did before the trip.    Thanks, and stay safe."
64721,My God Man!,PurpleNeptune,"Mar 21, 2010",HBW,"7:30pm - I got these seeds with a bit of skepticism. I\'ve done LSD before, the most being 2 hits at one time, so I though 15 seeds might give me that 2 hit experience. I crushed them up, and downed them with a glass of water. No Problem. I did this on an empty stomach.  I started feeling some nausea about 20 minutes later, not so bad, it only lasted about an hour.    9:00pm - I started feeling some effects, I started to wonder if this might just be a placebo effect. as more time would pass I would believe that if this was a placebo effect, it was one hell of a placebo effect.    10:00pm - I believe I started to peak around this time, it\'s a bit sketchy. Watching TV, faced started to have that mutating effect. Colors were definitly more intense. My thoughts began to transend far what I expected. This is were one would begin to realize that they were connected to the spirit world. It became an eye opening experience, especially for my personal life.    11:30pm - So it was around this time I decided to take this experience to a whole nother level. I smoked a bowl... This brought a whole new mind alteration. A happy, giggly sort of alteration. It also eased my mind somewhat, not that I was having a bad trip, but maybe borderline.     12:30am - I decided to watch the Beastie Boys \'Awesome, I Fuckin\' Shot That!\' This seemed to last for hours. It was a whole new experience.     3:30am - after about this time I\'m not sure how long the experience lasted because I went to sleep. But I can assure you that these seeds are no joke.  Next time I think I try going with less seeds."
70400,Tumbling Seeds,Gabe,"Jan 10, 2009",Morning Glory & H.B. Woodrose,"Hi folks, my experience with these two seeds has been wonderful and I have used them for a very long time.  I have always heard that some M.G. seeds had an applied coating of insecticide and fertilizer that was slightly toxic.  The same was said about the baby woodrose seeds, but I always bought my woodrose seeds still in the pods on stems with the petals.  I bought these at craft stores where the artsy crowd bought them for flower arangements etc.  I noticed that they would also give nausea and other unpleasant symptoms and heard through the grapevine that they had a natural coating on the seeds that kept seed eating critters away from them when they were alive.    I came up with a very simple way to remove whatever was on both seeds by simply running the for an hour or two in my rock tumbler. Baby woodrose seeds started out black but polished out to light tan.  M.G. seeds showed a similar dramatic change of color and I found this process to totally remove the toxicity from the seeds. I think maybe the M.G. seeds also may have had a plant produced substance on them also but this is a neat trick.  I sold the product for a good mark-up as a special variety of seed that were spared having the poison put on them."
73055,Ghana Strain Review,Ineedbout3fity,"Aug 24, 2008",H.B. Woodrose (Ghana Strain),"I noticed that there arent many (if any) HBWR Ghana strain reports so I thought I should add this as it is happening. I bought the seeds from one of the best vendors online for about $5.00/100.  I knew that they were less potent, but very inexpensive, compared to the Hawaiian strain; so I thought I would just up the dose.  Alone, I chewed all of the seeds over a two hour period on a light meal beforehand (30 mins before).  I am in good health, no meds, and in a good frame of mind to trip so fingers crossed (dicks too).      9:00pm-25 seeds eaten total/almost at once    1hr-after 50 seeds not much more than a slight buzz is noticed    2 hr-just finished the last 50, still only a slight buzz and now gas (hoo-raaaa!)    3hr-I believe I have reached peak buzz with slight euphoria, but still no trip    1:00am- no trip, no visuals (open or closed eye), only a mild narcotic like euphoria and slight body high                         Conclusion- For $5 I guess Im not too pissed, I mean I did achieve some effects with no discomfort.  Clearly I just need to buy the Hawaiian strain and eat the low seed doses; I believe they are $18/50.  The HBWR India strain is the next potent, supposedly, but still not near the Hawaiian by comparison ($9/50). Dont waste money on inferior strains.  I have read that some people actually puke their hearts out on 6-7 Hawaiian seeds; I ate 100 of the Ghana with little effect."
61349,It\'s Underrated,jeremi,"Apr 17, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"All my life has corolated to last night, it felt like my whole life reached a crescendo last night, cacaphony became harmony.  The most intense experience in my life.  Like LSD, but I feel much cleaner.  This drug is very well balanced which I loved, I had to fight for the rewards I got.  I felt completely balanced, my life was made up of extreme lows and highs, the highs were soo beautiful, I felt like I was enlightened and I would disapear if I so wanted to.      The onset was 4 hours for me, extreme body at first, we also hiked for those four hours, got rid of all the poisoned, I though I would fall asleep in snow after I threw up because I though it was the end of the trip, little did I know it was a mountain of ever increasing peaks, wow. We got back to an apartment and layed on beds until 9 am, where it was pure visual and out of body travels.  I cannot emphasize the strange ever rising aspect of this drug, being very ambivalent at first, thinking only 8 seeds, whats the big deal, I was not expecting the most powerful experience of my whole life\'s existence. I have only done this dose, but if felt very high, although not out of control, but very intense, the right amount for a powerful experience.  The poison was hard to deal with, I drank a lot of water, so much that I though I was drowning myself.  We came out of this being more clear and refreshed then ever before, a true purge.  Now having slept and woken up at 5 pm, I feel better and ready to do good deeds and become an active part in changing the word."
64963,Felt Like a Hybrid Human,Herr Mannelig,"Feb 27, 2008",H.B. Woodrose,"Well I recently had bought 50 H.B. seeds from a reliable vendor. And me and my friend (we ill call him MR. T) had made plans to use them that day. So when he was on his way I threw 4 seeds in my mouth chewed and swallowed. Now I have taken morning glories before 300 seeds to be exact (nothing happened...nothing at all) and they tasted like shit. So much so that the next time I wanted to try them I couldnt the taste made me gag . The H.B. didnt taste bad at all the chewing part was a little difficult they seemed rock hard.    By the time MR. T got to my house I felt pretty ill. (probably because I didnt wash the seeds off) but it wisent to bad I could steady it just by breathing. But when we got to his house about 10 mins later the sickness was pretty much gone. Then I took the bag out and divvied up 4 seeds for him and four more for me. This time though we washed the white shit off of the seeds. I wasnt rely keeping track of time but about 10 minutes after he took the seeds I could feel it coming on. It was similar to MJ but rather different (if that makes sense). Things took on a new perspective, colors seemed different and my pupils were fully dilated almost no cornea at all. We decided to go swimming. By that time I was almost at the peak of the trip.    When we got in the pool the water felt very strange. Felt like jello. When I closed my eyes under water I saw multi-colored swirls thats seemed to move around each other. When I came up I looked at the sun there was a small cloud over it and it was setting a little bit. Its was changing color green blue red orange ect. Mr. T I guess wasnt experiencing the drug yet and besides he only took 4. But he was getting angry with me because I was in the pool and not spending time with him. But I was tripping to bad to care. When he was trying to get me to come inside I was looking at him and there seemed to be a yellow aura around him it was very strange. By the way this whole time I rely didnt say anything to him. I guess he got angry and headed inside I must have been outside for at least a half an hour. I felt that I was like a hybrid human I went underwater, it felt like I could hold my breath forever (but I didnt chance it) every time I closed my eyes I kept seeing the same swirls of color....magnificent.     When I decided t get out if the pool I sat down and stared at this tree....it think it was trying to communicate...I walked up to it and touched a leaf....I dont know how to explain it. Then next thing I know Im on my hands and knees staring at the wood porch. I felt like something was watching me (not in a bad way like paranoia or anything) I asked who are you who are you and kinda came to the conclusion that it was me...but not.... I came inside and watched some TV (kinda brought me down) and we d3ecided to make some food it was like one of those bags with some noodles and veggies with like no nutritional values at all. Just pure MSG. After it was done we had a big bowl each I could barely pick up the fork it was odd I felt \'weak\' but I knew I wasnt. But anyway we both fished eventually. Then we got to talking (this is like 2 hrs later still peaking) about the universe life death god hell heaven. And the TV was on and I was like.....dude...urn it off. So he did. Then we were talking about space and where we go after death. I picked up a broom, and looked at the handle it seemed to like grow and crawl (looked exactly like shit dose after staring at a spiral for awhile then looking away)...also his couch seemed to change hue...then he asked for the broom.     And...well he explained the universe.....we think that when u die u reach the end of the universe (or at least what we know as it) because we as humans cannot comprehend nothingness  so once u die u are instantly reborn...may not on earth again but reborn. Like on the old Mario game when u go to one end of the screen u pop up at the other. After that we sat on the couch and kept talking about shit like that. And people drugs and why we feel and such.    All in all I would say this was a very good trip I plan to do them again very soon.    Thanks for listen    Peace, love, drugs, Terrence mckenna And bill hicks....and black metal"
35631,My Time with the Seeds,The Novice,"Dec 18, 2007",H. B. Woodrose,"Wanting to experience a psychedelic, during my first year of college my roommate and I ordered Hawiaan Baby Rosewood seeds.  This eventually led to four years of experimentation with psychedelics and other drugs.  All said I did H.B.W.R. 3 times, acid twice, X twice, and I smoked pot until it became commonplace (what a way to make your life boring).    Anyway, about the H.B.W.R.  First, I feel that I have lost memory capacity due to this drug.  I, of course, cannot confirm this.  However, I believe it strongly enough to reccomend against anyone taking these seeds.  Before I ever experimented I really had a mind for retaining facts (no matter how useless), and now I feel that it is difficult to retain the simplest information.  For instance, I really have trouble with driving directions that are more than a few steps if I do not write them down.  Albeit I was smoking pot most of this time, but I have not smoked in a couple months and I am still plagued with these memory problems.    Anyway, about H.W.B.R. -- well, at the best of times I felt a connection with everyone.  I arrogantly thought those who had taken them were enlightened, and those who had not were innocents -- unenlightened.  At the worst of times -- I was violently puking.  The actually--intelligent probably thought -- \'He is puking, therefore what he ingested was probably a bad decision.\'    What I remember most clearly about all the experiences, was the feeling of steadfastness.  Unlike acid, when I was on H.W.B.R. I felt like my bed was my home.  In fact, the force of gravity was so apparent that I felt that I was being forced to lay down when I sat on my bed, or forced to sit when i stood above a chair.  This was fortunate because it quelled my desire to seek out \'bigger and better things\' and forced me to explore exactly what I was experiencing at the moment.  Both times I did acid I felt compelled to immediately drop anything I was doing with the hope that what was next would be more exciting.     At any rate, my three experiences with H.W.B.R. were all positive but I feel they may of had lasting negative effects.  Maybe I will take H.B.W.R. once or twice more in my life but no more."
11684,Woke Up Tripping,Vespertilia,"Jul 27, 2007",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"My experience was in the mid-70s.  I ordered HB Woodrose seeds from a company advertised in High Times magazine.  Being totally uneducated as to preparation, I did not remove the fuzz from the seeds, but crushed them with a hammer into particles about 0.5 mm and put them in gel capsules.  I took them with water and waited about 30 minutes--nothing.  So, assuming it was worthless, I smoked a nice joint and lay down to sleep.  I woke to hallucinations of a wallpaper like pattern of pink birds, a complete visual field of a burr-like pattern and a total unreasoning terror.  My pupils were totally dilated, skin and oral mucosa white as death. All of this with vomiting of the most vile substance I have ever tasted.  I called my best friend to come over and trip sit with me and was only able to get out one syllable with each breath.  She stayed with me until the experience passed, which took about 4 to 5 hours.  Seriously, I cannot recommend this to anyone.  From that point on I stayed with \'safer\' known quantities like LSD or shrooms."
26360,Mental Anguish Resulted in Wanting Suicide,Anonymous,"Jun 26, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,I always wanted to try acid and experience something that takes me out of this world. I had done many pills before and after hearing about H.B Woodrose were supposed to be the next best thing to acid I decided to give them a go. As we bought them from a shop I didnt even expect them to work. We did all the requirements to take them and so we drank the water and eagerly awaited the results.     After a little while my vision started to alter and I was happy that they were kicking in quickly. My friend was feeling pretty sick and so was my brother but it was off and on. When I looked at things everything went off in different directions but slowly. This I liked but I wanted a more intense experience. My friend assured me that they get better and better and he was right. I started to trip out and I would wave my hands about and gaze dazedly at the colourful patterns that were left behind. Truly I thought these were better than pills or anything I ever had and I was even up for doing some more. The decision not to saved my life.     When we left my friends house we went to the woods. I was walking down the street still enjoying the experience and I resembled those guys in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This I liked. It was getting better and better but very soon worse and worse. By the time I got to the end of the street the mood changed. I felt nauseous and so did my Brother and friend and then all of a sudden my friend started heaving his guts up. It was dark and so I couldnt see it but it sounded so violent and this scared me. Low and behold about 1 minute after he was sick I was too. I felt like my chest was gonna explode. The thoughts going through my head were all saying that this is never going to end.     When I stopped heaving I thought I was better but I was kidding myself. Everything was rapidly moving of in different directions and there were strange colours everywhere and at this moment I realised that my mind couldnt take it anymore and there was nothing I could do about it. I wanted to cry and call the hospital even my mum but I knew that if I let these thoughts get the better of me then it can only get worse. I realised that I wasnt breathing and when I tried to breath I couldnt feel the air going into my lungs and I was panicking. I couldnt concentrate on anything not even my own breathing.     When I closed my eyes it didnt really help either. I would get crazy visions that I just wanted to get out of my head but I couldnt. I realised that once its in my head it is there to stay. I thought that I had gone insane and that never would I be able to normal again. Thoughts even occurred to me that the only way to end this would be to kill myself. I didnt like the place I was in as it had started to seem very sinister and like a place of evil. This was not improving matters so I said for the others to take me back to my friends house. I was eventually able to bring myself to reality and tell myself that its all in my head and it will be over soon and after an hour or so things calmed down a lot. It was at this point when my brother came out of the bedroom and started freaking out. He had tears in his eyes and just kept saying that he was scared. He stumbled around walking into all the rooms in a frenzy of confusion before violently vomiting in the bathroom.     As my other friends didnt freak out much they didnt understand what was happening to him considering all night my brother didnt even feel the effects of them. All he felt was ill until hours after when he freaked out. I went into the bathroom to see if he was ok. He was sat against the wall with his head between his knees and he kept saying how sacred he was. I tried to console and assure him he would be straight soon as it happened to me earlier but he didnt believe me.     I nearly lost him to an outburst of tears which is what I wanted to do and I knew that if he was feeling anything like I was if he broke down in tears of terror then he would never have stopped. Luckily he didnt and after a while he got over it but the experience left us shattered. I can no longer smoke weed due to me getting so paranoid its like having a panic attack and as for my brother he can smoke but for a while he thought that he was fucked up for life as he was having anxiety attacks for about 3 weeks after we did them.   My friend said he enjoyed them but the rest of us hated them and it just isnt worth the risk
58893,"Simple, Effective Preparation and Notes",Egor,"May 14, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"The best way to use them in my experiance is to start with 5 each time I get a batch (lowest level I find can be effective from MOST batches) to get a feel for the potency of said batch.    I have a very unique way of preparing them also.    1- get all the fuzz off of the outside of the seeds.  2- grind the seeds to a fine powder  3- spit on the seeds and let them sit for about 5 minutes  4- take the mush and put it on about 8 oz. of gatorade  5- stir and let the gatorade sit for about 45 min to an hour  The drink can be allowed to macerate overnight for better effect  6- use cheesecloth to filter the seed mush (which it will be by this point, and coffee filters clog up too easy)  7- Drink the liquid and enjoy!!    This method allows me to feel the effects very quickly, instead of the 1 hour minimum wait I experianced with all other preperations I tried. Effects within 30 mins most times.    Also, I find a quick bike ride or walk while waiting for the effects will greatly ease the leg cramps that are unavoidable with this substance. The saliva begins to break down the seed mush and allows for a much more effective extraction, as does the acidity of the gatorade."
22802,Euphoric Hookup,GreenGirl,"Feb 10, 2006",H.B. Woodrose,"My first experience with these seeds was a very positive one. My friends and I all took them at different times, yet we all started to trip at the same time. For at least an hour before they kicked in, we were all in agony, complaining of stomach pain. All we wanted to do was lay in bed clutching our stomachs. Finally, we felt well enough to travel the few blocks to our friends who gave us the seeds. There they had set up a very nice environment to trip in. And thats exactly what happened. As soon as we got to his house, our stomach pain disappeared and our trip kicked in. One word I would pick to describe it: Chill. We were all just chilling out. I went outside to sit on the porch, and started talking to this guy that I had a crush on. Because I was tripping really hard by this time, it was much easier to talk to him than it had ever been before. After chilling out for awhile, my other friends decided to go back home. I made the decision to stay with the guy. We went back to his room, and he set up another awesome tripping environment. We chilled out, and then eventually, we hooked up. The whole experience for me was entirely perfect. I experienced a lot of euphoria with these seeds, and the visuals were very cool too.     Later on, I found out that once my friends left, their trips began to go downhill. They found themselves alone, just the two of them, and started to trip out. With no one around to help them, they just continued in a circle of questions. Neither of them knows exactly what happened, all they would say was that they were somehow communicating with out speaking. Weird.     Overall, the experience with these seeds was very awesome, I personally experienced very little nausea, and had a very wonderful time. Highly recommended."
19926,Mind Explorers\' Seeds,Clar604,"Oct 7, 2005",H.B. Woodrose,"The first time I tried HBWR seeds(I believe these are good quality) I only scraped off the coating as I found instructs for everywhere online. I was very careful but it wasn\'t enough. I hadn\'t eaten in about 20 hours and I had just woken up and my mind was clear and sharp at the time. I ate 10 seeds (In my opinion, too much for first-timers but I am quite confident in myself). The taste is quite bad when chewed but nothing I couldn\'t stand for the time they\'re in my mouth. I swallowed them after a couple of minutes chewing.     In 30 minutes I started to experience nausea and it was so hard I\'d expect sensitive people to throw up. The nausea lasted for about 3 hours(and didn\'t go away with weed but I didn\'t smoke much) and made it nearly impossible to concentrate on the positive effects but I still noticed changes in perception and thinking. I was mostly lying on my bed because I also got very sleepy but the nausea kept me awake :). The peak came at 3 hours as I\'ve read from other experiences and it was like some out-of-this-world euphoria, a truly spiritual experience, very hard to explain. The nausea also disappeared then. But the negative effects were not over. My legs felt very heavy after that and I couldn\'t really even walk well so I just wanted the effects to go away after the peak that was the only positive effect I could really concentrate on. All effects were gone 3 hours after the peak so it was 6 hours total.    So that first experience wasn\'t very positive but the peak convinced me that this is a powerful psychedelic. I started to read everything I could find online about HBWR and it seemed to me that the irritant in the seeds was not just in the coating but also in the seed itself(because of the amount of nausea I and other people experienced). I also got the impression that the poison would be <a href=http://ace.orst.edu/info/extoxnet/faqs/natural/cya.htm>cyanogenic glycoside that produces hydrogen cyanide and the effects matched too. And since it\'s water soluble I decided to try to extract the poison from the seeds to remove the bad effects. From what I\'ve read and heard, it seems people have also drunk the extract (with water, I don\'t mean the petrol-extracts or anything that advanced :). So the extraction didn\'t really help them at all...    I scraped off the coating from 13 seeds this time and put them in water. After about 12 hours they were a little softer and I could crush them so the the water would get better in the inner parts(I apologize for my lack of professional terms :). I also removed some kind of jelly from the seeds with toilet paper and dried them as well as I could. My assumption was that the jelly would be irritants or something that doesn\'t have the LSA-alkaloids. Then I changed the water and put the crushed seeds in.(and repeated the same cleaning process and water changing once)    Now I had dry crushed seeds that shouldn\'t have the irritant but were hopefully still potent(although the extraction probably took some LSA-alkaloids too, can\'t confirm anything because of my poor knowledge in chemistry). I ate half of them and I had even eaten this time and smoked weed before a lot. I got no nausea at all but felt the effects. This time I could concentrate on them a lot better. Some minor visuals were also present but the dominant effect was on thinking. Thoughts were flowing all the time and if I didn\'t think of something, I got a little anxious. I still don\'t think this substance is hard for your psyche, it\'s just a little disturbing if you don\'t have anything to do or you start to think really negative things but you should know what you\'re doing when you take psychedelic drugs, right? I also got very sleepy again but I stayed awake most the time. This time it was a great tool to change perspective in thinking and see the bigger picture etc. I didn\'t experience the mystical peak this time though but the dosage was lower too. I also slept 12 hours after the experience and the dreams were very lucid(but not lucid-dreams) and my feelings in the dreams were as strong as awake. So this is a dream enhancer too: my dreams were simply amazing compared to usual, I could remember them very well afterwards too.     Next day I decided to try the rest of the crushed seeds(6,5) without any weed. I had eaten chocolate and unhealthy stuff like that. But no nausea this time either and I got the same effects as last time. Same goes for dreaming too. I believe the peak effect could be achieved this way too with larger dosage and also the duration was the same as with 10 seeds eaten.     So these seeds are definitely not for people who are looking for party stuff or cool visuals(I find that kind of things very shallow if they\'re dominant in the experience) but for mind explorers and people looking for new perspectives in their lives. I generally get very sleepy as it affects my dreams positively, I don\'t think it\'s a problem.  And I really recommend some extraction method, water worked for me very well without having noticeable affecting the potency. Just don\'t keep the seeds in water for too long and they should stay potent."
43221,Our Bodies React to Everything,FireJunky,"Jul 3, 2005",H.B. Woodrose & 2C-I,"First off I must tell you that when I took these seeds I and my friend had been off of weed and other drugs for 7 weeks.  I weigh 185 and my friend also male weighs 175.  I am 23 and my friend is 21.     We had both taken morning glory seeds in the past and puked with no trip.  I had succeeded in the past once with morning glory and once with 5 HBWR so I knew the effects of LSA. We where both well experienced with hallucinogens including mushrooms, Salvia, green hornet liquid, ecstacy, 2C-I, 2C-E and Amanitas.  I bought my seeds online from an online vendor; I bought 50 Hawaiian strain seeds but they actually hooked it up with 70 seeds. The seeds were guarenteed to be 100% all organic with no pestisides. I took 2 1/2 hours to carefully scrape all the coating off of 16 seeds. I scraped them until the seeds were completely beige.     6 hours before we ingested the seeds I ground them a good amount in a coffee grinder until they were almost powdery.  I seperated the batch into 2 seperated containers.  That day I decided to eat light, at 4:30 I ate one small batch of fries and a large frosty.  My friend ate at 3:00.  We decided to go camping in the mountains of Colorado by a stream.  It was a perfect night with t-shirt wearing weather.  No other people were around so we felt pretty safe.  Our lives had been pretty negitive the past 2 months so when we got to the mountains we felt well relaxed and in a positive mood. We decided to do this trip as more of a spiritual trip while being in nature.     We took 2 motion sickness pills 45 mintues before we ate the seeds at 6:45.  The sun was 30 minutes from going down when we took the seeds.  At 7:30 we put the powder under our tungues and held it there for around 5 minutes.  We then washed the seeds down with apple juice.  We set by the stream to try to relax.   30 minutes later we got up and started to feel a slight body buzz. We made a camp fire and layed down on the ground next to it.  At 8:30 it was pretty much dark and the near full moon was coming up.  Flashes of patterns started coming into my open eye vision.  We both decide to get up, when we do we realize our body high has increased.  At 9:00 our body high is in full effect and pattens are more intense.  We decide to take a walk to the water fall where there is a great view of the city of colorado springs.    Before we sat down at 10:30 I realized that I had a empty bag that had 2ci in it.  We licked one side of the bag a piece, there was probably one small hit per side. We sat down and looked at the city.  The lights from the city glowed in amazing ways and the sound of the waterfall were going in waves through our ears.  At this point we felt extremely well with no sick feeling at all.  Were in full effect of the drug.  When we close our eyes viberant patterns of non existent colors fill our heads, like looking at casino carpet through a calidescope.  Our bodies react to everything we touch much like ecstacy.  It was the most beuatifull and pure trip we had ever been on.    We walked around for awhile playing with and touching everything we could in amazement and then decided to head back.  We were walking up the path to our campsite at 11:45 and all of a sudden the 2ci kicks in.  At this point it was like no other trip we had ever experienced.  No words could ever decribe this trip. Amazing thoughts were going through our heads.  We, in my opinion, had just lost our minds.  We let go of reality in ways I never thought were possible to do and still come back from it.  The body high was beyond anything I ever amagined.  It felt like we were in heaven floating in clouds.  Ecstacy never could come close to this.  It seemed to be about 8 times as strong as any ecstacy I had ever taken, things felts so good it made me feel like I could have a seizure and I am not exaggerating this at all.    The rest of the night can not be explained or put in to words by god himself/herself/whoever/ or whatever.  We both went to bed at around 2:30, still fully tripping.  We felt so relaxed we couldn\'t move anymore.  We woke up at 8:00 and both of us where still mildly triping.  Crazy thoughts were still going trough our heads along with flashes of patterns.  As I write this at 1:45 I feel extremely in touch with my body.  It might be the lingering effects of the trip or it might just be because the trip made me feel more in touch with life.    All and all this was my favorite trip to date.  I do believe that scraping the seeds till they are bage colored will remove the irritants. Happy trippin\'."
17477,Hell Hath No Fury,Angel of Syn,"Jun 14, 2005",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"Alright, lets start from the beginning.. I\'ve used many a drugs in my life and though most people hold marijuana as a favorite in their regular use pattern, I\'ve always favored hallucinogens and opiates. So one day while roaming the internet just basically bored off my ass I found some info on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and the experience was said to be LSD-ish and what not and hey, I\'m not one to pass up new experiences, so I ordered some from an online botanical company.    Jump ahead - yesterday as I impatiently wait for the mailman *as usual really as I order alot of things from the net* he finally arrives with a little brown package. *YAY!* it was the seeds! Being nice and excited and ready for my new experience of the day I opened up the package and found the little bag of seeds. I did my best to remove all of the brown fuzzy shit on them and at about 2pm I flopped down on my bed and chewed up 9 of them. I figured \'heh, 9.. what the hell.. thats not much at all! but since its my first time using these why not stay at that..\' I regret ever thinking such a thing as \'9 isnt much.. hahaha.. I spit in the face of such pityfully small amounts!\' that was my basic idea on it but ya, right.. I\'m not sure if 9 is too much or not for me but I have no desire to ever try again and find out.    They took a while to kick in, and when they did I had what seemed to be maybe 15 minutes or so of \'lost time\' the first thing I knew of the experience was a sick feeling so I got up and started to walk to the bathroom, only made it about half way though before my legs gave out and at least seemed to be in serious pain so I had to drag myself to the toilet.. nothing though.. I got a grip on myself, stood back up, and walked back to my bed. Once I got back on my bed though the next phase of it all kicked in. It was very much like the film Trainspotting when the guy is locked in his room to break away from heroin. Basically curling up, writhing around in pain and generally fucking up my bed sheets and what not and all through this I was having \'strobe like\' hallucinations which reminds me of the scenes in Natural Born Killers.. Strange and colorful, fast moving insane hallucinations blinked in and out of my sight. Passing minutes seemed like days.. At one point through this I heard the phone ring and knew who it would be calling so I picked up the phone and tried my hardest to hold to what small amount of reality I could and told her to come over.. ASAP.. I tried to talk like I was A-OK and she didnt know anything about what was going on. I just knew in order to make it through this horrible experience I needed someone there that I could trust and help hold my ground somewhat in the real world.    *note* yes, I know that your always supposed to take things with someone so instances like this do not happen but I figured I\'ve done enough other things in my life and even during bad trips or what not I\'ve been able to keep myself together entirely.. I guess ignorance is bliss *but not for long* and I\'ve definitely learned my lesson as far as this kind of shit goes..    When she showed up she was high, my mysterious freaking out and expressions of pain kinda killed her buzz but the fact of her being there helped me out a LOT. I tried to explain what I could of what was going on and then off to the toilet I went. I puked.. layed down on the floor.. puked.. floor.. then just kind of crossed my arms and put my head down over the toilet.. I\'m not sure since I was still REALLY out of it at the time and dissasociated to the max, but what I was throwing up seemed mighty pink and then red.. perhaps it was blood, I couldnt tell at the time, I had worse things to worry about.    At this point I have to extend a great thank you to some person *dont remember who, or what drug* that wrote a report about going to the hospital and then like right after that he was fine and felt like an ass for not waiting it out.. I was very glad to have read that because around this point in the trip (curled up on the bathroom floor no less) I was in so much pain and so fucked up that it took everything I had to not just yell to someone \'CALL FUCKING 911\'.. and sure enough, after about 5 minutes (or what seemed like days) of that feeling - I was fine.    About 8pm it was all over.. I dont think I\'ll ever be so happy to come down from a drug as I felt at this point.. For the rest of the night and up untill I got up in the morning today and showered I remained very dissasociated and generally \'out of it\'.. Now I believe I\'m all here but I still have a lingering feeling of being \'gone\' at least a little bit.    What I have learned from this experience and what I would want to warn people of are thus-    1.) With the trip I had - major trip experience is needed and being perfectly cool in the head.. more than once during it my mind was crossed with a thought (though seemingly not my own thoughts.. hard to explain really) that the only way out is suicide, but my *reality mind*  kept up with me at least somewhat and I knew better.. this isnt a \'first try on drugs\' thing to do for ANYONE!    2.) Drugs are illegal for a reason - they make things illegal because there is a potential for abuse, therefore, LEGAL things such as this are probably not expected to be \'abused\' or used repeatedly.. THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS!.. I will definitely stick to the ILLEGAL drugs from now on.. I have 99% positive experiences with those, the legal drugs, no.. diphenhydramine is legal, that was somewhat interresting at points and not too horrid at all yet I\'ve still only brought myself to do that twice in three or so years.. Take the words of the wise, dont do legal drugs.. damn..     Lastly, I would like to thank the person that was there for me through this experience.. *you know who you are*.. it is one of the most appreciated things I could possibly think of..    ~Never Again..."
11754,Nothing Happened...,zaneofcawdor,"Nov 23, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"I ordered a packet of 25g of Argyreia nervosa (baby hawaiian woodrose)(Convolvulaceae) for \xa310 from a website that speciallises in ethnobotical seeds, cacti and chemically novel plants etc.  The seeds were an off white light yellow-brown colour approximately 3-5 mm in diameter (roughly).  As the seeds did not appear to have a \'fuzzy coating\' of any kind I presumed this had been removed by the supplier.      I crushed about 30 with a nut-cracker and broke them down as best I could (i don\'t have a grinder) and placed the seeds in a small jar of water.  I allowed the seeds to soak for about a day and drank half the fluid (not the seed matter at the bottom - I heard this induced vommiting).  There were no apparent effects at all.      I also tried eating the seeds - I ate about 5 (which incidentally I was able to chew with my teeth - I don\'t know if this is usual, I heard they should be rock hard).  Again no effects.  I don\'t know if I am doing something fundamentally wrong or if these are the wrong seeds.  The ethnoboticist isn\'t a \'head shop\', but comments on the seeds having \'Probably the most potent vegetative source of Lysergic amide alkaloids. Current strain in stock is a West Indian variety.\'  I think I\'ll try chewing down about 20 seeds and swallowing them - if that doesn\'t work I\'ll probably try planting them instead."
9910,Minor Effects -- Fraudulent Seeds??,Jason,"Aug 6, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"Several dosages were tried over several days.  Each trial used the below preparation process.    Preparation:  1.  Seeds arrive \'Pre-Cleaned and Fuzz Free\'  2.  Inspect seeds, looking for any remnant fine white fuzz that may have been missed.  Most seeds have very small amounts which are scraped off with a small sharp knife.  (It is my guess that the fuzz has something toxic in it and this is why some/most people experience sickness to some degree. With this process no sickness was experienced, however, read on as I now question if these seeds are really Hawaiian Baby Woodrose)  3.  Wash and rinse with filtered water (no soap, just scrubbing)  4.  Dry seeds with a towel.  5.  Crush with mortar and pedestal to make a fine powder.    (I hoped that by increasing the surface area absorption would be quicker and easier.  If chewed well and if absorption can occur in the mouth, then this would allow more consistent results as the state of the stomach (empty/full/etc) would be a smaller part of the equation.)  6.  Put small amounts in mouth and chew very well before swallowing until total dosage ingested.  Then start timer with which to correlate results.  This step was altered in some trials as noted below.    NOTE:  Validity of the seeds is in question!      Each trial was done on different days    Trial 1:  3 seeds to start, 2 more later  1 hour (after ingestion process ended): slight decrease in mental tracking of concurrent events, however with focus on one event, everything seems normal.  Very mundane effect and it may be missed if not specifically looking for something to happen.  This may even be a placebo effect.    1.5 hours: Ingest 2 more seeds (same preparation technique)  1.75 hours: some strange chest tightness, not pleasant, but not scary.  7 hours: No more effects.  Bedtime.  No strange dreams, no crazy hallucinations, no expected deeper than normal sleep.    Trial 2:  8 seeds (which is the highest recommended dosage, according to many sources)  5 minutes after a slow (10 minute) ingestion process (maybe in trial 1 the seeds got to the stomach too quick and mixed with food??): some minor body sensations which once observed would disappear.  These are very hard to describe - body just feels different and the effect is very minor.  7 hours: No more effects since those first few.    Trial 3:  5 seeds with a different ingestion technique.  On the possibility that the LSA needs to be in the stomach to be absorbed (and possibly is slow to arrive there or just lines throat when the seed powder is chewed), the seed powder is mixed with water then drank.  4 hours:  Relatively no effects were felt, just some of what was seen in trial 2, but to a smaller degree.  Somewhat increased desire to dance since body felt slightly odd.     Trial 4:  12 seeds using the original ingestion technique  Effectively no effects.  Those effects felt were as minor as in trial 3.    Trial 5:  Chewed 5 seeds instead of crushing with mortar and pedestal, just to see if this would change things; it did not.    Three other people (1 male, 2 female) tried 3 seeds each without noticing any effects.    Conclusion:  Effects over several trials of various dosages and trials by other people were not remotely as expected, taste was not \'terrible\' as expected. Though pictures of known HB Woodrose seeds match these samples, it seems these samples were not the seeds that were ordered.  **What might the effects be of these unknown seeds?!**"
10374,Quite Interesting...,WanderingShadow,"Mar 8, 2004","Syrian Rue, H.B. Woodrose, Kava, & Cannabis","After trying some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds with unsatisfying results, I was convinced I needed something else to improve their effects. So, I bought some Kava from an herb store and borrowed some Syrian Rue from a friend. Why not experiment by making a tea out of these three? So, I took about 5 teaspoons of the semi-ground up Syrian Rue seeds, 8 HB Woodrose seeds (scraped and crushed), about 2 tablespoons of dried Kava root, and two bags of herbal tea (mint and orange rind-yummy!) and let them soak in hot water all day, which was about 14 hours. So, after waiting, I strained this mush through a coffee filter, resulting in a cup (more or less) of poo-coloured liquid. I managed to drink it (it was bitter, but bearable, although it tasted worse closer to the bottom of the cup). After gagging down the last gulp, I had to drink some honey tea to help keep down the other tea (NOTE: I ate a mid-sized meal about two hours earlier).     After only a few minutes, I thought I felt a little bit lighter (probably placebo effect though) and I noticed my pupils were really quite large. Soon after, my brother came home and asked a favor of me. He was dead tired, so he asked me to go get his quarter sack. I was hesitant, but eager to get out of the house (let\'s face it, Alabama is BORING as Hell). Thus, I hopped in my car, and headed out (CAUTION: I DO NOT RECOMMEND DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS).    My journey began. Normally I\'m not the greatest driver at night, but because my pupils were dilated, I could see much better. Also, I felt a certain pleasant, content aura around my mind, but I didn\'t really experience any other effects physically or mentally. I arrived at my neighborhood Waffle House and met up with my friend, Captain P. I explained my situation to him, and he said he was getting hooked up later, so he\'d sell me some of his. So we waited at Waffle House and it was actually wasn\'t bad at all. I felt really content and creative, so I pulled out paper and pen and proceeded with some abstract sketches of the evening (the full moon was really spectacular). Everything was annoyingly bright, it was a little warm, and my head felt a little weak, although I felt no real nausea. I know these sound kind of bad, but perhaps I\'m blowing these out of preportion. Everyone seemed so interesting and with diverse personalities. Things were much funnier too. The whole time, I had this wierd feeling that the moon was looming outside. Twenty mintues later, the captain\'s hookup arrived and dealt out the sweet leaf.     He wanted to make some cash, so we drove over to a FOAF\'s house. What do you think we did? That\'s right! We burned a fatty and smoked a bowl while listening to Sublime. At this point, the tea was getting obnoxious, so I wanted to get it out of my system. After trying to puke for a couple minutes to no avail, I gave up and decided to chill on the couch. For the next couple of hours, we sat and watched my FOAF play Sonic the Hedgehog, and it was a lot more engrossing than you\'d think. I had cottonmouth and dry eyes, which was a bit annoying. Every few minutes, I\'d close my eyes and travel to a differnt place filled with colours, shapes, and lines. In one of these little trips, I thought I experienced a Miro painting. Then I\'d open my eyes and repeat the cycle again. But around 2:30, this experience was tiring me out. So, I drove home, handed my brother his nickel sack, and fell into a deep sleep.    The next day, had the kind of hangover I had before with the HB Woodrose seeds alone: an odd feeling in my stomach, and a sort of \'fuzzy\' feeling, but I think I felt sleepy cause of the hangover from the weed. Looking back, I remember the whole experience divided up into several wierd \'panels\'. The first panel: drinking the tea and being asked a favor. The second panel: Waffle house. The third panel: inside my FOAF\'s house. The fourth panel: gazing at the full moon outside my FOAF\'s house and the drive home. The whole ordeal was really interesting, but I don\'t think I\'ll try this again for a while; I still feel a little worn out."
30895,I Thought I Was Dying,tripper,"Mar 8, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,I ordered the woodrose seeds from the internet and received 10 from azarius. On friday-evening I decided to take 8. I grinded them and soaked them in water for 1 1/2 hour... and then I drunk the acid...(6:30pm). Rather quickly I started to feel the effects... My hart seemed to beat faster and faster and I felt terrible cold. About 8:30pm I started to be very anxious about my health... I thought my heart-rate would kill me. I called anti-poison-centre who calmed me but adviced me to let check my heart-rate by doctor or hospital. I called a doctor at service. To my surprize he wasnt very helpfull at all. He didnt know the substance he said but he would come and pass by... I was having visuals now (moving shadows and disturbance of lines).. The doctor still wasnt there and I got even more anxious... I went out and went to emergency - I even took my gsm with me in case I passed out and could dial 911- ...     10:00pm I am in front of emergency but I hesitate to go in because my job is related to the hospital. And I thought if in go my collegues and boss will know later about my bad habits ... So I doubted - Sit there at entrance ... Which seemed the best - because if a dropped dead there they find me quickly (I already had dialed 911 on my gsm now)... anxiousness increased and I was measureing out \'do you want to live or do you want to die?\' The rest of my life seemed to interesting and promising after all. The shame of being know as a druggie was worth to live on - even if I would lose my job - and I went in. The paramedics werent very friendly... then a doctor came... I was very ashamed. She took me heartbate and blood-pressure. It was ok she said. My heart would not collapse. That moment I was so fulled of joy that I embraced the doctor. I was very glad I was not going to waste...    She said I was having a severe panic-attack and gave me some diazepam to calm down. I cannot describe in words the joy I felt! I thanked the doctor... being ashamed and went home joyfully... hour before I thought going to die and now I could live further on... I was very very glad I had this experience. I definitely chosen live now. No more drugs. I was so glad that I lived on that possible consequences on my job seemed only details. I will change my lifestyle now.  This experience changed my life.
20104,A Fun Night in a Tornado Shelter,Fragbait,"Jan 20, 2004","5-MeO-DiPT, H.B. Woodrose, Salvia divinorum & Cannabis","Setting: At house in central Arkansas with many of my friends from high school.  I haven\'t seen most of these people in at least 5 months.  Almost everyone is tripping on 5-MeO-DiPT tonight, with a few of us tripping on more.    8:35pm: As soon as we get here the pipes are already being passed.  I break out the psychadelic box and give everyone their drugs.  Two friends and I are planning a combination trip tonight.  So we take our first drug: 10 seeds of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose.  We\'re all already quite stoned, and we prepare to wait out for a few hours so our various peaks will coincide.    9:45pm: The bodyache/high is starting from the LSA.  My friend remarks that this bears a striking resemblance to LSD.    10:35pm: Have experienced no nausea so far tonight, probably due the copious amounts of kind bud that is being smoked.  My two friends and I dose on 20mg of 5-MeO-DiPT.    10:40pm: I haven\'t been able to tell the passing of time for the last hour (or so).  So far the night is going wonderfully, and I can feel the effects of the LSA building.  ----------------------------------------------------------  Around an hour later, my friends and I smoked the last of my Salvia.  We were already getting heavy visuals off of the foxy, and the mental trip of the LSA was very synergistic.  This night was turning out to be exactly as we planned: excellent fun.    We were spending most of our time in a small 4x7-8 tornado shelter.  There was a red light that gave everything an infrared type glow, especially the tips of cigarettes.  The concrete walls were looking more and more like a changing rainbow of colors.  Right after we smoked the salvia, this effect was immediately apparent; I no longer needed to look for it.    Every time we went outside I would notice distinct patterning in the air and what I call a \'rainbow matrix.\'  Imagine a very, very tiny grid superimposed across your field of vision with every square a different color.  I\'ve gotten this effect several times before, and I love it. When I closed my eyes, I found that I could create any image I want.  I could even create complete environments and control my point of view within the new world. As the night slowly petered out, most of the weed that had been brought was gone (out of 2 ounces of kind or so, all that remained was a few joints\' worth).  My ex-girlfriend brought a date to the party, and it didn\'t bother me all night long.  In fact, I was very at ease and content with everything.    I learned so much about myself on this experience; I must repeat it in the future.  I am very content and happy with my life right now, and I think I have my thoughts on the trip to thank for it."
22282,Weird Witchcraft Paranormal Experience,AZAZEL,"Mar 21, 2003",H.B Woodrose,"Hi my name is charlie and one friday my wife and I decided to both take 15 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. we both grinded them up in a coffee grinder at about 3:00p P.M. After we both had ingested the seeds we both took some Vitamin C tablets 500mg a piece. We also ingested the ground up seeds in a little bit of orange juice. we both hadent eaten anything since the morning.  well anywhay my wife decides that we should go grocery shopping, BIGGGG mistake!!!!. As soon as we reached the grocery store, I started to feel Nauseious, and then promptly told my wife that I was going to puke and couldn\'t go inside. So she went inside and did the grocery shopping while I puked up what was left in my stomach of the undigested seed. After this we return home and the LSA is hitting me and not my wife yet, but this time it\'s hitting we harder than it has ever done to me before. My wife leaves me alone in our bedroom while she makes me something to eat.     The second she left me I noticed that I was in a highly suggestable state because as soon as she left the room I seriously thought that she was dead and would never see again. But I\'ve done a ton of acid and know what to do when I\'m freaking out, just tell myself \'flow like the water and enjoy the the rest of the trip\'. Then the scary thoughts and abstract thinking started to dissappear  and I started to drift farther and farther away from reality when I trip, as usual. Anywhay while i\'m tripping mostly in my head and not much visuals are going on, at 5:00 p.m then all of the sudden my wife comes into the bedroom with food and tells me it\'s hitting her hard and everything is melting and breathing, and alive, then I start having visual and slight auditorial hallucintation. After this the first thing that I noticed was that the ground in the house seemed curved and all of the lights in the house were bright, so I turned then off and decided turn on my collection of blacklights and eye candy that I have accumulated.     Things start getting wierder, all of the sudden I had the sudden urge to start walking on my tippy toes. By this time there was a weird effect going on in my mouth like every time I put LSA in my system, it\'s that chemical taste in the back of the mouth, and my mouth always feels sort of numb. Anyway I plop down in bed enjoying the colors and things that I see with my eyes opened and closed. We both start to sensually, but slowly take off our clothes, in a very weird drug like trance/seductive state. After this we both start our foreplay by kissing and licking each other all over our naked bodies. Just to see what it does to the senses. The love making was so incredible that we both felt that we were both melting into each other.\'I\'m not shitting you this sex felt better than it does on E\'. About this time we both had no depth perception what so ever. After we get done making this magical night of romantic love making, as soon as I exit her vagina she asks me who am I.     (I \'ll give you some background on this, I practice ritual witchraft and have been doing so since I was a little child and along the way of doing this I\'m somewhat possessed by a Demon know in the bible as Azrael, by the Sumarians he is known as AZEZEL, He is part of Legion and is one of Lucifers grand dukes in hell. one day I accidentally did a spell wrong and he entered into my body. Ever since this has happenned my life has gone to shit. Most of my friends won\'t talk to me, people are always looking at me funny, I have periods of blackouts and then snap out of it while I\'m in the middle of causing trouble, and I know it\'s him in my body, making me do these things that I can\'t remember)     STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT MAGIC IS REAL then let me finish the story. She ask me who I am and I tell my name is Azrael. Now It is 7:00 p.m.. She ask me this because my face is contorted , and breathing and speaking in an unhuman manner. All of my muscles were clenched up so tight the felt as though they were stronger than bricks. I was talking in Different langauges that I don\'t know, my wife identified a couple of them as Akadiun, Latin, Sumarian, and some other languages. I don\'t know how to speak these languages. I was saying all sorts of wierd demonic plans about how I had a part in the destruction of existence by hiding a demon inside of a clean pure soul while in heavon therefore this would allow legion to reak havok in heaven. This trance like state that I was in lasted for 3 hours. At first I thought that I was playing this and pretending this all, then AI realized that I couldnt stop saying these things.     Then things started to get wierder because I think that I was astral projecting because I could see myself from outside of myself, and the wierd part about that is that it didn\'t scare me at all, but I did want whatever he called himself to stop saying that I hate my wife, while what I was really saying was that I love you and somebody is making me say these things. My wife said that he was so strong that he could have ran through a brick wall and nothing would have affected me. He kept on asking for spell Book the Necromicon. but my wife refused and kept on saying to me or it that I love you no matter what you say or do, and every time that she said this it made him even more mad and made my face contort in such a devilish way that it was making my cheek muscles hurt. Then my wife casted a witches circle. Then I noticed that couldn\'t move outside of the circle. Then she through a bible on top of my back and it felt like it waid a million pounds and made it hard for me to move. then she started talking about jesus, he then started to laugh, and this had no effect.     Then after a while my wifre made a deal with the entity that entered my body by saying that I will love charlie nomatter what you make him do and I\'ll do until you leave and take her deal, or fight to the end. My wifes deal was that He could have my soul in 50 years, alive or dead as long as I get to live a happy life with my wife. he finally agreed to leave after many tortuose arguing with the entity. After he agreed to leaving it felt as though a wind had passed through the house very suddenly and made all of the doors rattle a little bit which both freaked me and my wife out. But this isn\'t the first time something like that wierd has happenned to me practing witchcraft but never has this happenned on drugs, but I ges when on altered states any thing can enter into body  I.E. metaphysically.    After this It\'s 10:00 I turn on some rave music and give my beautiful wife a light show. This leads to some more incredible love making in which we both close our eyes, see shapes pattern and just want to melt into each other. This was the kind of love making that leaves a sense of nostolgia when I are thinking about making love to my lover or to who ever it was. I have made love to many women and on many different drugs, but this drug just brought it to a whole nother level. After love making it\'s about 12:00 and I\'m comming down, but it\'s like a speedy comedown , like the kind where you just can\'t sleep, while my lover enters into a trance like state in which I think she had a second peak and the euphoria was to much for her that it was making her very sedated and tired. She eventually fell asleep at 2:00 because she and I smoked some pot. I did not go to sleep. I stayed up thinking, WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED.     All I know is that it wasn\'t me acting like that because I tried to stop it while it was going on, but could not so therefore my only conclusion is that I really was by this so called demon. The thing he spoke breathed, his accent, didn\'t seem normal at all. Also the knowledge that he knew that found out to be accurate by reading some parts of the bible. I could go on writing this story more and more but would probably be a whole book within itself.     P.S. I would do this drug again and the visuals were about 8 out of ten , but the total head change and thought process change would be like 11 out ten, off the scale."
22178,A Fantastic Voyage,chemlab,"Mar 17, 2003",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"I recently aquired some Hawaiin Baby Woodrose seeds from a source claiming that they were grown in Hawaii.  I had read numerous reports concerning the fuzzy coating surrounding the seeds.  Some theorize that these seeds (and morning glories) are intentially poisoned by seed companies to disccourage people from consuming these seeds.  Also, I have heard that these seeds and others such as Apple seeds naturally produce cyanide inside their seeds.  Nevertheless, I thought it would be a good idea to scrape these fuzzy coatings off before consuming the seeds.    First off, this is no way my first experience tripping or other highs. It would be easier to name what I haven\'t done.  Notable psychedelics that I have done would include LSD, MDMA, MDEA, 5-MeO-DiPT, Salvia, DiPT, 2CT7, Psilocybin + Psilocyn Mushrooms, Amanita Muscaria Mushrooms, DXM, Ketamine, AMT and probably some others that have been forgotten.  Basically saying I have seen a large spectrum of hallucinagenic substances.    Anyway, getting onto the real experience.  I have read many reports of people complaining of being nauseous and hear the same from experiences of my friends.  I have never felt nausea from LSD and thought maybe the possible naturally cyanide inside would be the culprit.  So thinking of putting LSD on my toungue and letting it absorb sublingually, I chewed the up 10 seeds (that had the fuzzy coating scraped off) and kept them soaking in my mouth for as long as I could.  The strange taste from the seeds began to build up after 15 mins or so and I couldn\'t take it and spit out the seeds,  Being completely sober before chewing the seeds, I felt a strange head change.  This was about 9:30 PM.    I then started to play Grand Turismo 3 for Playstation 2.  I dont like sitting around thinking about the experience to come.  I figured Video games would keep myself occupied for a while.    Around ten o\'clock I thought it would be worthwhile to eat some more seeds.  This time I thought, I will swallow them.  I chewed up the seeds and swallowed them with some Dr. Pepper.    Instanly after I guess the first 10 seeds kicked in.  I suddenly felt anxious.  Suddenly the nauseau built in my stomach.  I looked at the video game screen and thought I shouldn\'t have swallowed those seeds.    I decided to try smoking a nice nugget from my glass pipe.  A couple puffs of the sweet sinsemillia and my nausea was gone.  Also, accompanying my stomach feeling better were the start of visuals.     Around 11:30, I looked at my pupils in the mirror.  They were a little bigger than normal.  But, I never beleive I am tripping unless my pupils cover most of the colored part of my eye.  I was a little discouraged, but I still felt a nice buzz.  No one can put the way they feel in words, its impossible.  However, it did feel like its cousin LSD.  But, instead of being stimulated, my body felt depressed.  I was really lazy, lying down.  Something I would never do on acid.  I wasn\'t sure if this was due to the LSA or other ergoline contents of the seeds or the intoxicating effects of possibly cyanide.      I decided to chew up 4 more seeds and held them on my toungue but did not smallow them.  I spit them out after fifteen minutes and instatntly felt my effects jump dramatically.  I was surely tripping now.    I looked at my pupils and I could see only large black pools of oil, I thought. The walls began to breathe and things began to \'shift.\'  This was different from the flowing motion produced by LSD, Psilocybin, or 2CT7.  I would look at the celing and it would shift right, then back.  Something I have never seen from any other hallucinagen.    I packed up my bong with some more sensi.  I took a couple hits and felt even more intoxicated.  These seeds feel so different than all the other trips I have done.  I feel like I have downed a 12 pack of Beer, but took some LSD on top of it.  I usually drink when I trip and this is what it felt like.    I thought about so many things in my life.  I also thought about how I wanted to talk to people.  I usually trip with other people, this was a unique thing for me to trip by myself.  I also thought about all the crazy subtances I have consumed and the impact on my brain.  Nevertheless, i was enjoying myself.    I chilled out for a while, smoked some more Cannabis and watched Pulp Fiction for a while.  Around 3 AM, I felt drowsy and ending up falling asleep very easy.  This also totally different from all the other psychedelics I have done.   It didn\'t interrupt my sleeping pattern.    I was extremely impressed witht these seeds.  I slept all night and woke up feeling excellent.  No hangover.  I felt extremely happy the whole next day.  I think when I chew them up and keep them in my mouth, the LSA and ergolines are absorbed but not the toxic substances of the seeds.  Unfortunately, I need to consume nearly twice as many seeds for similar effect to swallowing.  Not swallowing them makes them feel more psychedelic and less intoxicated drunk feeling.    I liked these seeds and did not ever get the \'freaked\' out feeling achieved by Mushrooms or LSD.  They seemed to have more effects on my body and my vision than my thought processes.  Overall, I\'d say they feel like good clean hippy acid, but even more natural and way less stimulating."
19461,My Mind Wandered All Over the Place,Misty,"Dec 8, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I just woke up from a horrible night.    I had bought 300 HBWR seeds direct from hawaii. First time I took 10, and it was great. What I did not know is that there seems to be a long period of tolerance. A friend of mine tried 2 days after, and nothing happened, except getting sick. I tried 2 weeks later thinking that would be long enough.    I decided to try a different method, and instead of eating the seeds straight, I ground them in the coffee grinder and put it in applesauce and swallowed the gunk. I peeled/scraped the seeds very,very throroughly, not only the bark but the white film that covers the whole seed. I peeled 15 of these.    Very soon after ingestion, a few minutes, I felt the dull uncomfortableness in my stomache. When I ate the seeds straight it took much longer for this part, as opposed to grinding them.    I became more aware of my environment. After quite a few hours I saw visual patterns that were barely there, but they were there. I had a body trip and some slight mind wandering but in overall I didnt trip good. I have never been more sick and I vomited 3 or so times. I could not get comfortable in bed and kept squirming and finally passed out.    For anyone who is interested on what the trip is like, the first time when I took 10, was very visual, lots of patterning. I was very creative and my mind wandered all over the place. There is a body trip which is soemwhat uncomfortable. I was very giddy and something would excited me very easily, and excitment created this wave of chills all over my body. Its a nice trip. =)    HBWR is a nice trip if you dont mind vomiting. But there is tolerance. Remember that HBWR is NOT a cheap alternative to psychedelic drugs, it IS a psychedelic. Treat it with respect."
11621,Spiritual New Years,Wonderland,"Aug 28, 2002",H. B. Woodrose,"What a new years this started of to be?  I had tickets to this huge rave with some awesome DJ\'s.  I was looking forward to this event for a long time.  I had ordered some Hawaiin Baby Woodrose seeds from this website about a week before this event.  The night before the event I soaked 7 seeds in water overnight.  I then scraped off the outer coating on all 7 seeds with a knife.  At about 5pm I grounded the 7 seeds in a pepper grinder I bought for about $8 at a local market.  I then chewed the seeds right after grinding them.  The taste wasn\'t as bad as I heard it was going to be.  It kinda tasted like eating dirt.  I had eaten 3 hours before this and new that I might get some nausea for this, so I took a 50mg dramamine tablet right before I chewed up the seeds.    Within in an hour I was feeling great.  I felt no nausea so far.  I desided to call a cab to take me to the event.  The cab ride was a real trip.  I was starting to get some visuals at this point.  It was great.  I was also feeling some of the effects that you would get from ecstasy.  20 minutes later I got dropped off right near the event.  This was the worst vibe I have ever seen at an event in my entire life.  I arrived around 7pm, and I couldn\'t believe all the cops around.  Another bummer was they actually had police dogs at the front sniffing for drugs on people.  I saw a lot of people getting arrested.  I started to walk towards the enterance, and the first set of security informed everyone that there was no lights, no cameras, to lighters, no glowsticks, and pretty much no anything.  This really sucked.  I had my $500 digital camera, glowsticks, and my $70 rainbow lights with me.  I had no car to stash these items in.  So I just decided to get another cab and go back home.  I was a little disappointed because I had emailed the event and asked if these items would be ok to bring in.  They said it wouldn\'t be a problem.  I don\'t really blame it on the event promoters though, this was a police issue in a bad area.    When I got home I was fully tripping.  I turned off all my lights and turned on my portable laser light show that displays off of my wall.  As soon as I layed down I went into another dimention.  It\'s like I was seeing different levels in the air that is all around us.  At around 11pm I started to feel the nausea.  I new this would happen though.  In doing these seeds fasting the whole day is a MUST.  I know if I didn\'t eat at 3pm I would have not felt the sickness.  I felt as though I was going to throw up, but nothing came out of my stomach.  I was happy with this.  I really didn\'t want to throw up.  I probably felt this sickness feeling for about 20 minutes.  Then I started have a lot of gas from my stomach.  I got back in bed and then kept burping for quite a long time.  I then continued my jouney into the unknown until about 2am.  At this point I started to feel a little sleepy, so I started to go to bed.  Closing my eyes, I saw a lot of the color red.  I fell asleep pretty quickly.    This was one of the best experiences of my life.  This was complet happiness and very every spiritual.  So,next time I know not to eat anything that day and not to go to another rave in this area again."
10098,An Interesting Beginning,Agrivan,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I currently live in an area where certain substances of an illicit nature are hard to come by and cracked down on often. So my quest for good legal high began.    I was talking with an old friend who used to hook me up before I moved and he mentioned he ordered these seeds off of the internet because he had some friends that took them and had reports of nice LSD-like trips. I had never tripped before, but since they were legal, cheap, and very easy to obtain I figured, what the hell?, and ordered some.    A few days later they came in a bag, over 100 at least. After reading about so many people getting bad stomach reactions, I decided to try them later as I had a dinner thing that night.... Anyway after the dinner I came home and decided to try them anyway. I took 4 seeds, scraped a little bit of the fuzz off with my fingernails and then burned them a little to make sure the skin wouldnt make me ill. Now I am a big guy, and I have heard of people taking much more than I and being much smaller, but I had never tripped before. Anyway, I cut the seeds into fourths with a knife and soaked them in cold water for a while. The water turned greenish after an hour or so, so I drank the water and chewed up the seeds in my mouth and swallowed them. I also took a dramamine and some pepto at the same time. I had a very small amount of nausea which when away quickly when I took a tums and another small swig of pepto.    So about three hours later I didnt really feel much and decided to go to sleep. The only thing I had felt was the TV like coming towards me and everything else falling away, also I felt a little euphoric. Just better than usual I guess. I checked my email and had the same thing happen with the monitor, but it wasnt much so I went to bed.    Thats when the cool things happened! I had one dim candle going flickering and I was staring up at the ceiling fan and its shadow and it felt like I was being raised and the fan was falling. An excellent experience indeed. I found I could ground myself very easily by just lighting another candle, but i blew it out and stared at the shadow of the fan on the ceiling. It was sort of changing shape and moving... also the walls seems to be different somehow, (not breathing like many people have said would happen). Anyway, there was also some sound in my  ears, mainly a ringing type noise while this was going on.    I told my girlfriend about it, and while she is hesitant... I think I might be able to get her to try it with me. It was a very mile pleasureable experience and I would recommend it for anyone, including first time trippers like me. I think I might up the dosage next time."
7615,Nothing I Would Recommend to Any One,L,"May 31, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"Well, I\'m still coming down from the trip so please excuse spelling and so on. Probably a very stupid idea; writing while intoxicated. But please bear with me. I don\'t know how much of this I will remember tomorrow.     Location: My bedroom.    Mindset: Felt a little blue but not depressed.    Peparation of seeds: Scraped of the coating with a knife. Chewed and swallowed.    Sitter: None    I munched down 5 seeds 5 hours ago. Rinsed them down with water.    \'Bout one hour after consumtion I was gettin real worried and felt very dizzy. I was gettin a little paranoid (well, not just a little; I started to think that I never be normal again).     The body felt very light. It still does. Not very pleasant though. Although I felt bad and still feel a little weird. I haven\'t had that much trouble with nausea.     I felt really long and got scared that if I\'d fall to the ground I would break. I had to remember to breathe, \'cause if I didn\'t I would stop breathing and that would hardly be good.     Not much visuals. But everything looks strange. Some things seem very big, other things; small.     Thoughts rushing trough my head made it very hard to relax. I tried to get some sleep but my head simply wouldn\'t calm itself down. Although I was to tired I felt that if I couldn\'t get to sleep I would break down and cry, I still couldn\'t get to sleep.     Overall a rather scary and unpleasant experience. Not something I would recommend for anyone interested in trippin\'."
6818,6 Hour Ride,LSDChem,"May 1, 2002",H. B. Woodrose & Ephedrine,"I got off work with a terrible headach, and had 10 B. H. seeds And 1 ephedrine pill ready to go.  I timed myself; I ingested the seeds one by one drinking strawberry soda to flush the taste I didn\'t chew the seeds up I just broke them in my mouth then splashed the soda back and swallowed.  Last after all the seeds I took down the ephedrine.    I read that woodrose is a quick trip 30 minutes and you peak beganing to fall slowly, not for me.  30 minutes went by nothing but the smallest amount of nausea.  I walked around for about 45 minutes going to a few close stores getting my smokes and drinks, like O.J, but I never needed it.  I went home at about my first hour of ingestion and laid down.  I kind of slept for another hour.  When I woke up I felt like I was drunk, so I decided to go downstairs, and smoke a black & mild. When I got down stairs and began smokeing the fun began I felt like I was so happy, and excited when I listened to the music I got so into it.    About 15 minutes later The awsome feeling became so intense I had to close my eyes for several minutes.  I have done a lot of drugs out there and I swear this was the greatest experiance I have ever had. I\'m comparing this to acid & XTC together, which could not beat this, I have done those together many times because I thought you couldn\'t get any better, And I was wrong.  I found myself haveing trouble walking, but not in a bad way I felt like I was as High as I could get.    I had done 1 hit of acid the weekend before and caught visuals, but my mind had trouble conversating, but not on woodrose I could talk for hours with some club homeies. I was in XTC. I reset my clock when I new I was peaking, and the total ride from high to low lasted 6 hours + 2 hour come on I had very few visuals, but I was on this ride for a high, and damn I got it."
7031,Second Time Was Even Better,Crazy Douglas,"Apr 28, 2002",H. B.Woodrose,"We tried these once before and they worked quite well...this time we prepared high concentrated tea with eight seeds by using little water.  After crushing the seeds and letting them soak for about 3 hours,At about 6:15 we mixed in some orange juice and drank as fast as we could...I didn\'t manage to drink all of it. As always an hour later my stomach hurt some and I ended up vomiting up my lunch which I knew I shouldn\'t have eaten in the first place...dammit.    So another hour passes, then another hour passes. (This is the wierdest part about these drugs. You feel wierd for like two or three hours, and don\'t think anything is going to happen.) anyway, the lassitude was quite heavy, and my stomach still felt a little bad, but then everything started to change. Staring at things is always awesome because they move and look cool. Thinking and talking was fun because it was hard to communicate the amazing ideas we were thinking.  We also got this overwhleming good feeling that\'s hard to explain.    We ended up sitting in a field for a while and looking at the stars and trees which were amazing...almost too amazing. and continued on our journey around our campus...finally at about one in the morning I was tired so I went home to bed...oh yeah...we always smoke a little green to help the trip kick in, it relaxes me...so consider that."
7758,Frustrating Small-Dose Experience,Calvin,"Apr 27, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I ordered a package of 10 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds from the internet, because I was curious about the effects of legally obtainable psychedelics.     Following directions found on Erowid, I scraped the yellow funk off each of the seeds. The color of the seeds after scraping them was a rich red, like that of wood used to make nice furniture.    Having never tried hbwr seeds before, I dosed with only 3 seeds to get an idea of their effects. I chewed and swallowed the seeds at 10:30pm.     The effects came on slowly, but by around midnight, I was definitely in an altered state of mind. My mind was completely blank. I had the impression that my mind was standing in a big room all by itself; the random thoughts normally floating around in my head were absent.     I was also overcome by an overwhelming urge to sleep, which I couldn\'t fulfill. I\'m a late-night person, so this tiredness must have come from the seeds. I laid myself in bed, but couldn\'t sleep, even though my mind seemed devoid of any distracting thoughts.     I felt the need to throw up several times through the night, but couldn\'t. It seemed like my system was rejecting the seeds, but rejected even more so the idea of throwing up. So I was plagued the entire night with terrible heartburn.    I lay in bed awake all night, feeling really sleepy and frustrated. I felt like my wild animal instincts had somehow been turned on. Perhaps I couldn\'t sleep because my body was flooded with adrenaline - who knows. My senses were sharpened, but I didn\'t really notice any visual distortions until later on in the early morning.    At around 6:00 am, I really began to feel delerious. I was expecting to be able to sleep by this time, and really things were just picking up momentum. I went for a walk in a nearby park, hoping to make myself tired enough to sleep, or just to get my metabolism up enough to let the chemicals run their course. My movement through the park made my stomach upset, so I tried again a few times unsuccessfully to throw up. After an hour or so of wandering aimlessly in the park, I went back home to try to sleep again.    I finally fell asleep around 9:30, but woke up again with bad heartburn around 11:00.    I don\'t plan to eat the remaining seeds. I wouldn\'t characterize my experience as enjoyable or educational."
4634,What a combo,Mad Scientist,"Dec 30, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds & Salvia divinorum,"My friends and I are very interested in entheogens and decided to try out some \'legal\' ones.  So we ordered Morning Glories, Hawiian Baby Woodrose, and Salvia divinorum from a company called Pure Land Ethnobotanicals(www.ethnobotanicals.com *check it out*).  As soon as the package arrived I, being the scientist of the group, started a water extraction of the HBWRs by first crushing and then soaking the seeds in water overnight.  Each of our teas had been made with about 11 seeds and were all filtered prior to drinking.  Dramamine was taken 15 minutes before to help with any nausea but we had plenty of weed to take care of that problem if necessary.      We all consumed our teas the next evening(8 pm) at my friend A\'s house since his mom was going to be out.  My friend M and I both drank all of our tea and A only drank half of his.  Since I had been fasting the day before, the effects began showing up after 5-10 minutes.  It felt very much like coming up on cid with feelings of alertness, body sensations, and a zoomed feeling.  Unfortunently A was having some nausea but he says that he never hurled.  M and I were basically fine and I noticed only mild tightness in my stomach the whole night.  After about an hour I was getting some mild visual effects.  At this point the psychological and physical effectes had become very strong.  M and I were talking about how good we were feeling and agreed this was like acid without the dirty, cracked out feeling you get from it.  The seeds have a much cleaner high that really open the doors for some good intellecual insights.  Unlike acid they make you want to sit instead of dance or move around.    At this point we decided to smoke a bowl(of weed, not Salvia) in praise of the Gods and Goddesses that make drugs so cool.  We loaded some good shit into A\'s glass piece and went out to sit on the back porch.  Our vision was really enhanced on the seeds.  I could see perfectly even though it was a pretty dark night.  The THC accentuated the LSA just like it does for LSD.  My OEVs were much more pronounced and my CEVs were downright incredible.  We cashed the bowl and went back inside to investigate the kitchen, I was f*cking starving from all the previous fasting and we all pigged out major league.  This was very odd because I can\'t eat a thing tripping acid.  Sitting at the table eating with my eyes closed staring at the intricate patterns that would form on the back of my eyelids occupied my time for a while.  I love the CEVs on LSA.      A couple hours had passed since drinkage had occured and M and I were having a great time giving A shit like we always do.  We tried and tried to get him to finish his tea to no avail, but I guess he had a reason since his mom was going to be home later.  A was reporting the same sensations as we were, but his were probably a bit weaker, although he claims they were the same.  I was still coming up a bit at this point and was pretty messed up.  LSA gave me the same \'acid head\' sensation as the real deal, you must know that crazy acid induced thought process that I am talking about.  The visuals off of the plain LSA weren\'t really getting any stronger so at 10:30pm we decided to try the Salvia out.  We were going to find out soon that we had all underestimated the power of this plant.    We got the bong ready with ice water and put a party bowl on the stem to get some good ass hits.  This was going to be M\'s first Salvia trip and A and I\'s first time trying it with another psychedelic.  We all headed out to sit in my car since it was pretty cold out and we didn\'t want to be tranced out laying in the snow.  A decided to go first and took 3-4 good hits, holding the smoke each time, and then passed the bong to M.  In a very short amout of time A was talking really crazily about shadows touching him and that his arms were all weighted down.  Then I quit trying to listed to him as he kept nodding off.  M took 3 hits in the same way and passed the bong to me.  One of his hits kicked his ass and he didn\'t really say or move after he handed it to me.  I should have waited for them to get back to reality before I toked on it but I guess I\'m impatient.  I took 3 hits and got hit by the Salvia fast.      Salvia is really strange shit, lets put it that way.  After my hits there was a pull on my head to the left so i rested it against the car window.  OEVs were getting stronger and stronger but I couldn\'t keep my head in the car.  It felt so much better to just close my eyes and let go but when I did . . . WHAM!  The sights that you encounter on a good Salvia journey are second only to DMT.  You get lost in your own hyperspace.  I some how knew that I was human and in the car but it was much easier on my brain to let the Salvia to take the lead.  I saw strange repeating pentagonal patterns(soccer ball style) that stretched on to infinty in all directions.  These patterns contained distorted images of people I suppose were my mom and dad.  This pattern would sometimes morph into designs of words, patterns, and faces that would morph back into the pentagonal pattern.  During this journey if I at times gained enough will power and self recognition that I could open my eyes, I would pop back into the car, but the real world was just as distorted as the Salvia realm so I would go back there for a while.  All in all it was the most powerful hallucinogenic experience that I have ever had(over acid, shrooms, ketamine, MDMA, and DXM(and if you have never tried a high level DXM trip, it is very intense)).  The visions of my parents were disconcerting while tripping and made me feel a little uncomfortable.  This could have stemmed from problems that I have with them and I think I gained some insights into my relationship with them.    I was the first to really come back and the other two were starting to come back as well so I said I was going inside.  A minute or two later they came in.  All we could really say was \'wow.\'  Later I asked them how their trips went and both said that they had gotten lost in the music which was understandable since we had some PSY trance going in the CD player of my car.  I never really noticed the music while we were in it but the said it was like the music was all around them and all throughout their bodies with crazy visuals that coincided with the sounds.  Even after I had come back inside if I closed my eyes I could get the pentagonal pattern with less intensity.  This faded after 15-20 more minutes.    This night proved to be a good one for all and the remainder was spent listening to music, playing N64, etc.  The Salvia was the best part by far and now that I know what it is all about I am eager to try it again in combination with other entheogens.  Some 5x extract of Salvia sounds spicy as well.  I learned to respect the plant that night and how to flow with the journey if I choose to use it again.  I feel Salvia has the power to open doors into your own mind and exposed you to other realities.  What a cool plant!  Another thing we found out is that LSA is just about as cool as its cousin acid and in some ways LSA is better.  If we had done acid we would have been up all night, but we were all able to fall asleep around 2am.  The next morning came and we all felt OK.    Summary: LSA is equivalent to LSD but was a much cleaner, mellow high           LSA + Salvia divinorum=INTENSELY COOL           Total Time: 6-7 hours           All drugs and chemicals ingested: LSA, THC, Salvinorin-a,  Dramamine(otc), Vitamin C+E tablet, hella pizza"
11067,Six Seeds,Kat,"Dec 5, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"I was at my friends house one night it was 11pm and the two of us were bored. We decided to take HBW. My friend had taken them before and said that they were really good. We tried to peel the skin off of them but found it difficult and gave up. I took all six at once and chewed them up. We rented a movie and about a half hour into the movie I started feeling really oozy, kind of drowsy and mellow but nausious at the same time. I thought that like mushrooms it would pass and I\'d start to feel better. The nausious feeling went on for the rest of the movie and I fell asleep. A half hour later I woke up fucked. My friend had fallen asleep and they didn\'t hit her at all and she had seven. I tried to sleep but I couldn\'t. I felt like I couldn\'t breath, like something heavy was on my chest. I was tripping but it was good, it was scary. They gave me the weirdest feeling, everytime I was lying down I had to get up and when I stood up and tried to walk I got so dizzy I had to sit down. I felt as if I drank two 40s of vodka. After hours of crying, tripping and freaking out at 8am I finally fell asleep.     I\'ve done lots of other types of drugs before and this was definatly the worst experience. I know other people that have done them as well and their experience similar to mine. I thought that because it was natural and even legal that they couldn\'t be that potent but I was wrong."
66059,A Second Chance at Life,Sparxjosh,"Aug 14, 2021",H.B. Woodrose,"LSA-Hole    I was staying with a friend one weekend, just two regular potheads.  I have experienced with LSA in the form of Morning Glory before, but I honestly thought the drug was just a joke. Later on that night we called our dealer about some weed and were offered Hawaiin Baby Woodrose seeds.  I saw the dude was fucked up off of them so I figured why not try it.    At about 9 at night we at the seeds, I had 8 and my friend had 10. Immediately after, we went and smoked two 2-gram blunts of mid-grade.  During the second blunt time started going really slow and everywhere I looked I was forgetting what things were.  About 70% through the second blunt, we had to put it out because we could feel a hard trip coming on.  We sat there talking for about thirty minutes about life, and I could tell he was having a depressed trip and I tried not to let it affect mine.    After another thirty minutes we went to get food. Leaving the room we had been in suddenly made me feel sick.  My friend was having a bad trip and went to hang out with his mom.  I went back to the room, where everything felt peaceful.  I never saw anything pop out at me, but everything around me looked different than it was.  Posters didnt have the same pictures on them.    I knew my friends trip had gone down already, and mine did too when his mom came to see how I was doing.  I immediately went to the bathroom and started throwing up for the next hour.  While sitting there I was thinking, Maybe I\'ll have a brain aneurism, or maybe I\'m already dead. These thoughts seem absurd to me now, but then it all seemed so likely.    After vomiting, I went to lie down and my friend walked into the room.  He started hugging me and saying \'I know this is strange, but I really need you to be here for me now.\' I honestly think he thought his whole life was over. I couldnt take it and I started vomiting again.    Afterwards, I went back into the room and found myself alone. I was happy alone, so I locked the door and easily fell asleep. When I awoke, I felt like I had just gotten a second chance at life. I also felt like I lacked in ceratonin. That whole day after was spent in a daze.    Not even the rest of that second blunt could bring me back to my normal self."

(separate and individual summaries) Nicotine, caffeine, cannabis, cannabis resin, LSA, amphetamines (age 5-13), nitrous oxide, powdered wormwood, and lucid dreaming. These are the forms of altered consciousness Ive explored.    <!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TV_128Fz2g    -->Nicotine: for me nicotine is enjoyable every now and then; but nicotine also feels toxic. It makes me feel slightly weak, I notice. And I rarely enjoy it as much as other drugs. i mainly vape. Before I smoked a few cigarettes in my life. I also feel this weakness while chain vaping. The vape isnt good for me though! Because it still contains nicotine; though I know its not nearly as harmful and addictive as cigarettes. But nicotine use seems to be according to how slightly I get buzzed on it. I dont like it as much as any other drug though; but its definitely addictive; I should be extremely careful about using it.    Caffiene: since a young age Ive drank coffee nearly daily for my entire life<!--  since the estimated age of 2. Im not sure-->. Caffeine is addictive for sure. But its also delicious! Though good coffee is hard to come by; I am picky. Unfortunately caffeine isnt all that beneficial; I dont think its all that harmful either.    Cannabis: Ive tried cannabis at the age of 12; but only became a user and less of a tryer when I was 16. I am 18 now and have used cannabis and it has affected me positively with my ADHD and bipolar and APD. It also affects me in the sense of a delightful headspace. Yes I like cannabis for the high and the medical application for it. I also get insomnia some nights. Lately Ive been getting good sleep without the cannabis though. But some nights cannabis can help me get a good nights rest.    Cannabis resin: I once received 14 grams of resin; it took a few months of frequent smoking to finally finish it. I find that resin is more damaging to my lungs and vocal cords; due to heat and thick harsh smoke and I have yet to find a resin FAQ unfortunately, I would like to learn more about resin; I occasionally partake.    Amphetamines: from the age of 5 they had me on amphetamines. I had anorexia and serious insomnia as a result. By the age of 13 they had me on the maximum adult dosage. Eventually I had to discontinue use due to blood pressure issues. They also had to prescribe me other meds to get me to eat I think.    LSA: LSA made a profound long term impact on my APD. I no longer feel like everyone is constantly judging me. I dont feel like I cant be myself around others. LSA was the start of my interest in psychedelics. I havent used many psychedelics but hawaiian baby woodrose seeds have always been my choice of LSA; Id eat the crushed seed matter. It causes psychological nausea every time for some reason. Also Ive used high doses (10 seeds) and have experienced intense crisis situations and although I benefited positively from facing it on my own, a nice trip sitter would have been wonderful at the time. LSA is wonderful! Or at least I think so. It helped me to see things in a different perspective and allowed me time to take in. it allowed me to appreciate the beauty of things. I once caressed the earth gently; it was incredible! Beautifully incredible how connected I became with the massiveness of the earth. It was a giant and I was just a small ant compared. LSA could be a medicine one day; I believe. I say it needs to be researched more; if someone could put up some research projects with it to see how it affects people compared to other drugs. LSA made textures visually pop out, colour enhanced and sight would become sharpened and clearer. Ive seen very beautiful landscapes, tree bark, rocks, a creeks water, fallen logs, miles of woods and terrain, and all kinds of amazing beautiful things in my nature trips. Other home trips were nice; but nature trips are the best of all! Ohh and I receive many interesting tactile sensations; its as if my skin is orgasming wherever I touch.    Nitrose Oxide: I once inhaled some whippits. When I first used it; I got a big enough hit to burst into uncontrollable laughter. Other times I attempted inhaling and mainly got a headhigh; which was very interesting on its own; though I wish for uncontrolleable laughter again dammit! Ha ha ha\x85    Powdered wormwood: the first time I snorted it; I got an uncontrollable erection. Interesting. I also notice its just an interesting experience; Ive never noticed or remembered lucid dreams with it though. Not entirely sure how Id describer it. It was interesting but not too much. It wasnt entirely an aphrodisiac; it only lasted around 10 minutes peak and then stayed in this wormwoody feeling for a while (hours or so, depending on how much Id use). Im not sure if this describes it well though.    Lucid dreaming: I have experienced other worldly experiences; even out of body experiences. It was amazing; Ive done all kinds of things; traveled in the astral world throughout the house and outside in the yard where everything was different. I once found myself in a dream where there was lamps everywhere and I turned them all on. I also had these teeth that were all weird and crazy. Ive walked into a gymnasium with a bunch of pools and babies floating, not swimming, but stagnantly floating upright staring at me. Ive fallen into an alchemy void and been roared at by a celestial dragon. Ive found nerd friends, and one had this dream of destroying a city with a robot thing he designed, it was epic, he was all like killing all of these people is so worth it. Ive had some crazy travel dreams where I travel or walk in cities, houses, magical places, eerie places, and just in many different areas. Dreaming is amazing; I love it and wish I could lucid dream naturally<!-- ; I may need lucid dreaming herbs to help-->."
75621,A Mood Lift,Theuix,"Feb 24, 2021","H.B. Woodrose, Cannabis & Citalopram","This was my first time using LSA. I haven\'t yet tried mushrooms or LSD so for the most part I haven\'t really gotten into psychedelics. At least never enough of one to hallucinate. And actually this wasn\'t a big enough dose to hallucinate either.    8:30--I chewed up 5 seeds at 8:30. I wasn\'t having the best night and didn\'t think that I would like the high very much. However I was surprised later on.    9:15--I began to feel quite relaxed and a bit sedated. Since I wasn\'t really thinking it was going to be that great, I wasn\'t really looking at things in a positive way.    9:30--At around this time I began to feel more energized and less depressed. I was starting to notice a change in consciousness and less coordinated and a bit of a mood lift. At this point me and my brother went and took some hits of dope from a pipe. After getting high off that I felt a little better. The effects of the LSA were effeminately making things a lot more interesting.    10:00--This is probably around when I reached the peak of the effects. I felt a really nice mood lift. Quite trippy effects although not enough to really have visuals, although when I gazed off I began to have faint visuals. When I stared into a mirror it looked like the walls behind me were moving. I had a much better self image and a nice enjoyable high.    It turned out to be quite enjoyable. It\'s effects reminded me and were closest to a second plateau DXM high. Although not quite as good, it was getting close to it."
114879,Wavy Ride,Sunday_s best,"Oct 18, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"8 HBWR seeds were soaked in water for a few minutes to loosen there fuzzy coating, scraped clean of the fuzzy coating, and ground in a coffee grinder.     After grinding the seed powder was placed in a small piece of taffy, rolled into a ball, and swallowed like a pill. This method was used since I did not have 00 capsules. I also ate a small chunk of ginger and a little dark chocolate. The seeds were eaten on an empty stomach.     I experienced little to no nausea, but did have to pee a lot.    The on set was within an hour, and there was a very wavy warmth that flushed my body for close to 4 hours, but my feet and hands was a little cold so wear socks. There was also a nice afterglow or come down that lasted a while. This has been one of the best experiences Ive had with HBWR. The trick is to not taste, or smell the seeds. Have fun, and be safe."
105094,A Lesson Learned,Disoriented,"May 29, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Last night, I did something that I swore I would never do. I underestimated the power of a psychedelic. \'They\'re just seeds,\' I thought to myself. \'What could they really do?\' I did not realize that LSA is a very powerful psychedelic, and even though the seeds are small, 8 is a lot. Especially when you weigh not much over 100 pounds.     It all started when my best friend, let\'s call him \'B\', texted me and asked me if I\'ve ever heard of Hawaiian baby Woodrose. Being very interested in psychoactives, I had heard of the plant, but only a little. B told me that his good friends were over and they had a bag filled with the seeds of the plant. He sent me a picture to confirm that they were the correct seeds, and asked my opinion on whether or not he should partake in the psychedelic journey. After doing some research, I decided that he would be fine if he only ate a couple seeds and didn\'t drive. He told me that he wanted me to be there with him while he did this, but I was scheduled to work that night, so I turned down that offer. Now, this happened to be on the night of a very bad snow storm. I work at a restaurant, and moments after turning down B on his offer, my boss called me and told me that I didn\'t have to come to work because it was going to be so slow. Directly after, I called B to let him know that I was coming to babysit him and his friends on this drug.    When I arrived at B\'s house, B\'s good friends, let\'s call them \'K\' \'L\' and \'A\' were all sitting on the couch. All four of these boys are heavier, older, and more experienced with drugs than I. Speaking of, it may be helpful for the reader if I include my previous drug usage in this form. I use marijuana on a daily basis, I\'ve done MDMA once, and DXM once. Back to the story, almost immediately upon arrival, K, who owned the bag of seeds, asked me if I would like to trip with them. After doing about another 20 minutes of research, I agreed to trip with them.     \'We all ate 5 seeds,\' Reported K, \'but if you REALLY want to trip, you should eat like 9.\' Coming from the person who bought the bag, and from someone who had personally already taken it, I thought that this was a seriously good idea. So, I ate 5 seeds to begin with. Then 20 minutes later I barely felt anything so I ate two more. That\'s when it started to kick in. I was contemplating eating the last two seeds, and ended up giving one of the seeds to B, probably a good thing I did, because 8 was a LOT, and I can only imagine that 9 would have been even crazier.     It turns out that I actually ate probably twice as many seeds as I should have. I actually ate probably twice as many seeds as I should have. At first I just felt dizzy and disoriented, kind of like alcohol intoxication. I would stare off into space, and when I went to say a sentence it was like words came out of my mouth that weren\'t at all what I had intended to say. There were no hallucinations, it just seemed like my mind would play tricks on me and distort my vision. When walking towards something it wouldn\'t appear to get any closer as I approached it.     Soon, a few more friends came over, J, N and M. We could all tell that they knew that we were extremely fucked up. After a while N asked us why we were acting so weird and what we were on. When we told them \'Hawaiian baby Woodrose\' they were confused because they\'d never heard of it. We explained that it was LSA. N and M were very intrigued and asked K if they could buy some. He sold them 6 seeds each for a total of $10 which is a huge rip off seeing as the bag that he bought online contained 100 seeds and was $20. But hey, when people lack knowledge it leads to profit.     N, M and myself went outside to smoke a bowl of cannabis. Upon reaching the outside, a December night in Buffalo Ny, I realized that I did not feel cold. The drug some how numbed me to temperature. We smoked a good 2 bowls. The cannabis greatly intensified the effects of the LSA. After smoking I was way more distorted and Extremely thirsty so I went back outside and made my way up the stairs, slowly, one step at a time.     When I got upstairs I felt a very strong urge to vomit. I kneeled over the toilet for what felt like a very long time and nothing came out of me. I spat into the toilet and watched small pieces of seeds fall into the water in front of me. I felt a vibe that they were laughing at me. I wanted to cry. I was too fucked up. I did not like this. I stood up and looked in the mirror to notice that basically my entire eye was pupil. I turned the mirror light on for some reason and it burned my eyes, my pupils did not shrink at all. I went to the kitchen and poured a glass of water, that I drank in about one big sip as soon as it reached the plastic of the cup. I heard people coming up the stairs and for some reason quickly ran to the couch and laid down.     Everyone else joined me on the couch, and I suddenly felt a strong love and compassion and desperately wanted a hug. B was in the kitchen so I walked out with him. I told him I needed him to hug me more than I\'ve ever needed anything. He was putting a frozen pizza in the oven, but the thought of eating completely repulsed me. After a second he pulled me into a gentle embrace and it felt so good, probably the best hug of my life.     It was around then that I realized that I was so fucked up that I needed to go to bed. It was about 7:30. The seeds were consumed at 5.     I went into B\'s room and got on my side of the bed. I felt really hot and took my socks off even though I always sleep with socks on. And then I realized that I could not lay still at all, and there was no way on earth I was going to fall asleep. For what seemed like 30 minutes but actually turned out to be 2 hours, I basically uncontrollably thrashed around in B\'s bed. My breathing was strange. In breaths were normal but I couldn\'t breathe out without accompanying my breath with a small, sad moan. I could not lay still for the life of me. I heard the sound of B\'s mom, my aunt, who had just come home from work and that\'s when I realized it must be 10 o\'clock.     That\'s when I had that strong, unmistakable feeling. I knew I had to throw up. A lot. I knew I had to throw up. A lot. I got up and turned on the light and grabbed the nearest trash can. I sat up against the wall. My hearing was very distorted, I was still very very fucked up. I faintly heard B\'s mom say \'what?! Really?? Something happened??\' Then B walked in and said \'have you puked?! I just puked so much! And my mom knows I\'m puking!!\' Shit, I thought, she\'s going to know we\'re on something. But I couldn\'t say that because before I knew it my face was glued to the trash can. I puked about 12 times and every single time I could feel the seed chunks in the vomit. They were laughing at me. I made a mistake and they knew it. I felt so overpowered. B walked out and I was still puking, rather loudly. I thought his mom would come in and it would be all over. And the next thing I knew, I was pissing my pants. I knew it was coming, I could feel it. I tried to stop the urine from coming out but I had absolutely no control over that part of my body. Urine trickled out of me and the whole time all I could think of was how helpless I was, how powerful this drug is and how I will never underestimate a psychedelic again. It was able to take complete control over my body.     After I was done puking, I got up and got back into B\'s bed even though I was slightly damp with urine. A few moments later he came in and laid down with me. I went to say something and realized that it hurt my back terribly bad to speak. This pain upon speaking lasted until about two days after the experience. I gently told this to B and he laid with me and rubbed my back for a few minutes. \'I don\'t want to leave you.\' He said. \'I\'m scared that this is going to be one of those things where I let you go to sleep and then you never wake up.\' I had already thought of this earlier and had read an article saying that the seeds contain cyanide. I also read that plants that contain cyanide have very little of the poison in them so a huge amount would have to be consumed to die. This information reassured B that I was okay. He went back into the living room, and I felt much better. The vomiting made the restlessness go away and I was able to easily fall asleep.     So I suppose that the moral of the story is that just because this is a natural drug, and they\'re just little seeds, doesn\'t mean that they aren\'t a powerful psychedelic. Do not make the mistake that I did and do not take more than you can handle, especially on your first time with the drug. Just because it\'s a small amount of substance didn\'t mean that they won\'t make you piss your pants while simultaneously vomiting your life away into your cousins trash can."
93227,Not a Good Combo,madscience,"May 24, 2020",H.B. Woodrose & Cocaine,"To start off I\'d like to mention that I\'m a healthy individual with no medical history, and a lot of experience with drugs, especially psychedelia.    I\'m not dwell too much on the feeling of tripping on LSA,I feel like there are enough threads about that. This is more of a warning about the potential health risks of combining LSA with Cocaine or any amphetamines: Meth, MDMA, Adderal, Etc.    In doing research on an LSA extraction, I found out that LSA is vascoconstrictive, meaning that it restricts your blood vessels, hampering blood flow. I also knew that cocaine and amphetamines are also vascoconstrictive, but I had tripped on lSA before,plus I roll all the time, so I nonchalantly thought it was no big deal to combine the substances.    At 6:30 I drank my LSA tincture, I took it early because it has a 1.5-2 hour come-up. Approximately 1 hour into my trip my friend offers me a few lines of blow. I accept, I\'m feeling great and we drive to a venue to see a show.    When we are dancing I can\'t help but feel weird. I feel the normal affect of the LSA, plus the coke, but I have a weird feeling like my heart is under pressure (Hard to explain). Also I realize that my fingers are feeling numb. I knew I was not dehydrated because I was making sure to drink plenty of water and I wasn\'t even sweating from dancing.    It worried me enough that I decided to stop dancing and chill out until the coke wore off and I felt my fingers again and my heart stopped feeling like it was going to stop. I was fine for the rest of the night, but that doesn\'t mean under different circumstances this combination could be hazardous.    I hope I\'m the 1% that had this kind of reaction, but still I won\'t be <!--my advice would be never to -->mixing LSA with coke or amphetamines again, it\'s just not worth it."
100856,Long Term Effects,Healed from seeds,"May 20, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"Today I woke up, not feeling down, not feeling depressed, not feeling suicidal. For me I believe I owe it all to the Hawaiian baby Woodrose seeds.    Up until one year ago I was diagnosed with severe depression, and in a bid to source a cheap way to take drugs I found the Hawaiian baby woodrose. The long term effects of heavy use is not documented, but I have been taking it a lot. I could easily say for 18 months, and over those 18 months I have done near to over 50 trips over those 18 months I have done near to over 50 trips. This is not something I am recommending as a cure for depression!!!    The vomiting that can occur first of all, only happened to me one time when I took them drunk. The more trips I do, the more weird I feel, and the more those explosive thoughts occur. I can be left with feelings of unreality.     Everything for me, for at-least the last 3 months have started feeling more and more like a dream. And with this effect I have started doing less trips. What has changed? Well in my circumstances nothing, I am still the same guy without many friends, and am alone a lot of the time. But no more depression, no more suicidal feelings, this way that I am left feeling, in this state of unreality I am in no doubt that the Hawaiian baby Woodrose seeds has done it to me, and on that note bad trips are very rare, I have only had 1. ( a trip in front of family)    but the journey I would not like to face again. As strange as the world has started to feel for me, as it is now, if I don\'t do a trip every month or so, the world starts to feel even more unreal. So I am now dependent on it."
78941,The Seeds Didn\'t Taste as Usual,green snake,"Apr 13, 2020",Argyreia speciosa (sold as H.B. Woodrose),"Beware of Fake H.B. Woodrose    A month ago I bought 100 Argyreia Nervosa seeds from an online vendor. The day I received the seeds I popped them in immediately. I\'ve had previous experiences with H.B. Woodrose and at the time of the seed consumption I noticed the seeds didn\'t taste as usual, they tasted more like grass. I noticed the seeds didn\'t taste as usual, they tasted more like grass. After 30 minutes I didn\'t experience the usual euphoria. Instead, two hours went by and I didn\'t perceive any behavioral changes and knew I had been ripped off. So, I went to sleep disappointed.    The next morning upon waking up, my neck was stiff and every time I touched any part of my body it would hurt, even sitting in a plump leather couch would hurt. I knew something had gone terribly wrong. My body was hurting for the next two days and it was complete hell. I took a close look at the seeds I had bought and noticed that they looked different than H.B.W. Thanks to the image vault I identified the poison I have taken as Argyreia Speciosa. I googled Argyreia Speciosa and sure enough chemicals in those seeds caused the reactions I had experienced.    So please, every time you buy Argyreia Nervosa seeds compare them to an image of a real H.B. Woodrose seed before ingesting the alleged entheogen."

That took about 8 hours. I took <!-- LSA, a cousin of LSD that results in a trip of about 4-6 hours by ingesting a seed called--> Hawaiien baby woodrose. <!-- It\'s also a psychedelic that induces euphoria.-->    I started at around 10:30pm. I scraped the husk off carefully from 5 seeds and crushed them in my mouth and let my saliva work at it. Around midnight (I had expected to trip already within 30-60 mins), I just felt really cramped and sick. I walked back home with my boyfriend and started to feel jittery, as in when I\'d try to sit down on the carpet it was like my legs were jello and I\'d just halfway fall into it. There was a point where it felt too bad and I just went to bed hoping it would pass, but I started twitching uncontrollably and even my speech was altered. After about two hours of twitching and it not stopping, my boyfriend called a friend to drive me to the hospital. After about two hours of twitching and it not stopping, my boyfriend called a friend to drive me to the hospital. I had intense mood swings, switching almost every minute, and they had to carry me to the car because moving my hand even was hard.    They wheeled me in the hospital and the twitches had almost stopped but as soon as the doctor\'s took over, I puked all over 4 times in a row. I instantly felt better :D They carried me onto a board then the bed and removed my clothes while my boyfriend was registering me. Then they hooked me up to an ecg and did 4 tests throughout the night I was told as well as blood tests.  My mood swings were still present :p     They hooked me up to an IV for the night and monitored my heart rate. I came in at about 122 bpm. It steadied at around 109 bpm until about 10 in the morning I\'m assuming and I got let out at 1045. After they had me all hooked up and my boyfriend was allowed to stay with me, the high instantly hit and I was intensely happy :) It was really funny because I\'d think of something worrying like is my heart going to stay like that forever... and I\'d get all teared up and about to cry then I\'d look over at him and istantly have the biggest smile xD that happened for a few hours. Finally we fell asleep and I left in the morning after a saline injection. The doctor told me to get another ecg the following week and come back.      I went to the doctor today. I now have first, possibly second degree heart block. That means the signal for my heart to beat is slowed or disrupted from the upper to the lower chambers. I feel dizzy and faint more or less often. Further testing tomorrow will tell me what the other heart problem was. <!-- Hawaiien babywoodrose seeds are legal at 18 and over at Jupiter. Legal. -->    The reason I wanted to try it was for the visuals. I didn\'t hallucinate.    NOT worth it."
101490,Giving Argyreia Another Chance,Naabi,"Feb 18, 2020",H.B. Woodrose,"As many of my friends enjoy LSA trips, I have a big source of Argyreia nervosa seeds in here. I tried taking them in natura, just cut off all the brown part and ate about 4 seeds. I felt sick, but didn\'t puke. When the sickness went away (it stayed for about an hour) the trip began but it was all confusing and lethargic. I couldn\'t concentrate on the simplest of tasks, like watching tv. So ever since I don\'t enjoy taking the seeds.    A close friend gave me some a while ago and I though it wasn\'t polite to return them, so I went online, and researched a lot<!-- and found out LSA can be converted to an LSD-like substance, called LSH. So there I go-->.    Last night was my first try.    8 PM - Drank the liquid. Tasted weird but easy to drink.  8h30 PM - Start to feel a little different, I decide to get some weed and smoke it in my bong.  9h30 PM - I hit a plateau. No nausea was experienced so far. I feel like I had taken some great acid, the music much smoother, a huge feeling of happiness taking over. My head was lighter and when I tried to watch a movie or something, I would sometimes stare at one point of the screen, have a deep thought about life and smile for a while. I would see amazing patterns sometimes as well, and felt an amazing energy to do things.  1 AM - I no longer feel the amazing plateau. Just some after effects that are enhanced with weed, and the feeling of joy. Pretty much all the effect is gone, but the plateau lasted from 9h30 PM to 12h30 AM!    I felt no nausea throughout the whole experience, and woke up feeling great the next day. Still feeling happy and having small flashbacks when I smoke weed. <!-- It\'s definately worth the time and effort and much, much better than LSA.-->"
79981,8 Hours With a Really Nice Afterglow,Cassiopeia,"Dec 28, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"A Great First Experience    I only took three seeds but I had amazing effects just the same. There is a bit of nausea in the first hour or so, but it is not bad. A little music and some weed fixed me right up.     I saw some light tracers, but not a lot of visuals. The body trip is great and I felt very connected with nature. My mind felt very clear and at no point did I feel out of control or that I could be a danger to myself and others.     My trip lasted about 8 hours with a really nice afterglow. The come down was gentle and I slept great afterward.     All in all a good experience I will be repeating!"
108874,Never Again,Tripper123,"Jul 11, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,The first time (and last) I tried Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds (hbw) I was at a friend\'s house earlier this year. I saw a Ziploc full of them and asked what they were. He started telling me about all of his other friends doing it and him doing it so I decided to try it and thats where I went wrong.     He told me to take 12 seeds so I did. About an hour and a half later I started to feel them a little I don\'t really remember the beginning of the trip. After they started to peak I got horrible cramps all over my legs After they started to peak I got horrible cramps all over my legs they were so bad I could barely walk so I sat down. I started to think I was being kicked out of his house and that I was going to have to walk home that\'s all my mind could process every word my friends said I thought was them getting ready to kick me out.     I began to feel sick so I went and sat down by the trashcan but never threw up. It felt like only a couple minutes but my friends said it was almost an hour I was pretty confused. After that we went to his kitchen to get something to eat but I wasn\'t hungry so I got some water but my hands were shaking I could barely drink. I sat in the kitchen for a little bit but I started to feel sick and ran to the trashcan and threw up.     When we went back to the room I still thought I was being kicked out and my brain just was fried so I sat back down and started to smoke a blunt which helped alot and also made me able to finally fall asleep.     I woke up in the middle of the night in complete darkness and felt 100 times better I didn\'t feel the seeds at all I was so happy it was finally over. And that\'s why I will never do hbw again.
31299,Kicked in the Ass,bernie brewer,"May 27, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Well, yesturday the H.B. Woodrose seeds that I had orderd off of the internet finally came.  I went over to my friend\'s house and the four of us ground up about 11 seeds each.  We ate the dirt like seeds at about 8:30pm and sat down to smoke some weed.  Around the time we expected to be coming down off of the weed, about 10:30, we all realized that we weren\'t coming down.  We were getting higher.  I have taken shrooms and morning glories before, but it was nothing like this. From 10:30 to 11:00 I wasnt really tripping but I was feeling a really intense body high.  It felt like my entire body was being touched.  It was a very good feeling.    At around 11:00 I started have some visuals.  The walls and ceiling were morphing together and I was seeing geometric shapes and all the usual stuff. It was at this time I started to feel like I wasnt getting enough blood flow to my hands and my feet.  They were reddish purple, and I was feeling a little crick in my arm right around the elbow.  It hurt at the vein though.  It was weird.    We went to get some food about 12:00am and I was still tripping hard.  When we got back I ran all the way to the apartment(up stairs) and went into the bathroom to pee.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and my hand was in the toilette soaking in my own pee.   I had passed out.  My friends came to check on me and it took about ten min. for me to get oriented again.  After that we all just sat in the living room listening to our favorate band, and watching the cieling move.  I went home around 1:00am, and I was still getting visuals, but the body trip was gone.  I tried to sleep, but I couldnt.  I laid in my bed looking at the cieling until about 5:00am when I finally fell asleep.    Also, throughout the whole thing my friends and I felt like our bones wanted out of our bodies for some reason....wierd.    I want to try it again but the passing out thing scared me.  It was really fun except for the passing out.<!--I would recomend it but watch out for the circulation thing.-->"
35869,It Was Fun Then FUCKED Up,Baby Woodrose seeds,"May 27, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Well, this was my first time experiencing the magical seeds. I took the 1st one around 7:30. Then I decided to call my friend C Man and tell him that our seeds have came in from hawaii. Then I took the 2nd one when I hung up. When he got here around 9PM I was already pretty messed up. When he got here he took 5 and sucked on the chewed up seeds for about 5 min then washed them down with some iced tea.    Around 10PM I took my 9th seed and he took his 8th. I actually think that these seeds are better than LSD. Because after I get about an hour or 2 into the trip I can control it, also I can actually sleep when I\'m on it. Lol if I fall asleep I will have some pretty wicked dreams. I\'ve done a shit load of DXM and the 4th plateau is nothing compared to these seeds. We listened to trace concerts from a websiteand the music went well with the trip.    Around 12PM it really hit us we were Fried. We started to trip out on everything. When I\'m Fucked up on LSD or LSA the craziest shit to do is to look at someone elses face and stare at them. Some freaky shit happens to their faces. It was crazy from 12-3 its all a little blurry but we both were seeing shit everywhere. We both were having out of body experiences and thought that God was holding us in his arms. We both threwup around 1AM. When I threw up in my trash can my vomit turned into little gremlins and started to attack each other lol.    Around 2Am C man cracked and started to lose it and broke into a cold sweat. Lol then he started pissing in my bed for some reason so I hit his ass in the ribs. Then around 2:30 he started to piss in my trash can but I was like what the hell atleast its not my bed. I was thinking how do you like that you little fucking gremlins. Around 3 we started triping by looking at each other again. Then I think we went to bed cause its all blurry from there.    Then only thing that I didnt like about the trip was that the next day I felt like I was dieing I didnt feel like eating any thing but I did want to drink it was weird. I felt poisoned. I really dont feel like typing anymore cause me a C man just ate 3 again so FUCK OFF and let me trip again. So cya they are bad ass little seeds.<!--but dont underestimate them they will kick you in the ass if you do. Happy Tripping everybody-->"
56787,What a Flop at This Dose,Biggie606,"May 27, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Let me start by saying I am a large enthusiast in the realm of psychedelics, both by use of drug or by use of meditation or concentration as I have learned through readings I have done. So last night when I decided I would take ten Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds it was a very exciting moment. Yet as it happens I was quite disappointed with the outcome of the night. My experience went as follows.    Around nine o\'clock I was about to head next door to play poker with my usual buddies when I decided tonight was the night to try them before all my friends were able to (they had class the next day and I didn\'t). So I crushed up eight seeds, put them into a bottle with some tea and capped the bottle. I left that in my room while I went to play. Approximately three and a half hours later I returned and it was time to drink the tea. I drank and as I reached some seeds in it not fully ground up I chewed them some and swallowed them. I then decided I would watch some adult swim. I layed down and turned it on to come in right as one of my favorite shows started. I layed there and watched two shows then realized nothing was happening yet.    At this point I grew very impatient. I took out two more seeds, popped them in my mouth, chewed them up and chased with some water. I reassured my self that this would secure the trip I had been waiting for. After approximately one more hour, which made it T+2 hours, I began to feel a little discomfort in my stomache. I still just watched TV and waited. Maybe twenty minutes later I began to feel a slight body buzz and some random muscle twiching. I turned off the TV in an attempt to accelerate the effects (usually darkness helps me to strengthen the trip). As I lay there I tried looking all around in hopes that something would change, even just slightly. After another hour and a half the slight body buzz was still all I was experiencing. So with it now being T+3 hours 30 minutes I was quite upset and decided it was too late and I should go to bed. I settled down and had no problem getting to sleep.    This morning I woke up with no after effects and no satisfaction for the night. I plan to try again in a couple nights, since I have many more seeds, but next time I will definitely up the dose some and see if another preparation method helps me any."
31077,Felt So Sick and Drained,Bluzza,"May 22, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,The first thing I should have been aware of was the fact I hadn\'t really done any hard drugs only weed. So I decided I would try some of these seeds except I went a little overboard. I crushed up 15 seeds and chewed them and left them under my tongue for about 5 minutes then swallowed them and washed the disgusting taste down with coke. I then smoked about 5 cones because I was told that would kill the nausea (how wrong was I).     After about 3/4 of an hour I started to feel really sick so I decided to go 2 bed and hopefully it would get better. After about another hour or so I had been sick twice and my stomach felt all funny. About 2 and a half to 3 hours after taking the seeds it started to hit  About 2 and a half to 3 hours after taking the seeds it started to hit and about 30 minutes later I was seeing and hearing things that weren\'t normal. I saw doors moving by themselves posters sort of coming alive and music continuously playing in my head and I still felt so sick. I tried to sleep but whenever I closed my eyes all I could see was rainbow colours.     Some might say this isn\'t possible but I kid you not that noises were intensified and things were moving so slowly and the next day I was told I was talking to myself continously just saying jibberish. The trip would\'ve been really fun if I hadn\'t felt so sick and drained. I woke up the next morning after about 4 hours sleep and things were still very blurry. I dont know whether it was the lack of sleep or the seeds but the next day I was so drained and exhausted I fell asleep at about 7:30 and slept till 8 the next day.     All in all I dont think I should have taken so many to start with cause my brother took only 6 and he was fine. <!--Another suggestions for potential users dont eat within 5 hours before taking them or your night will be much worse.-->

56131,A Great Day but We Had No Trip at All,disappointed,"Mar 1, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,"Duds    We purchased ten seeds but received fourteen and a lollipop.  At first we thought this was generosity, but we soon realized it was a joke, as was the warning \'do not underestimate these seeds\'.  As first timers we were advised to take no more than two or three, however, after taking seven we realized that there was a whole load of foolery going around!  We followed the instructions to a T but nothing happened, except for becoming even more shit at pool than we already were and very drowsy-although that could have been the movie we were watching.  Overall, it was a great day but we had no trip at all and a vague lingering fear that the trip might hit us some time in the future.."
65077,A White Stallion,London,"Feb 28, 2019",H.B. Woodrose,Under the influence of LSA    A white stallion rose out of the mass of cloud and engulfed the plane amid his chest.    The petals falling around me looked like rain. Felt like rain.    I have a splitting headache.    The number 2 has become a fascination of mine. Its sound is the only thing that can kill my headache.    All the light here is yellow.    I cant hear out of my left ear but it doesnt seem to matter. Like Im falling.    I am noticing things I have never seen before. The colour of the carpet in the room I have lived in for years.    The phones ringing.

I ordered 175 seeds for a good rate. They were delivered with the white crap removed.     I ate 18 seeds before work, I breezed through the shift with an unusual quirky and energetic approach. Everything made me laugh and become a comedian. My eyes shined a glossy fire. I felt a great body buzz. 8 hours of busting my ass in total euphoria! I had slight visuals, but realized they were induced by the elements around me.     After I got home I took 17 more seeds after beating them with a hammer. I ate them and washed it down with vitamin c enhanced Hawaiian Punch. I drank a little rum, and felt an ecstasy body buzz followed by slight visuals. I am still buzzing as I write this. I think I will next work on proper methods of extraction."

So I started to brew the caps I had into a tea. I added a little camomile because I had heard that the taste was unpleasant. (its true)    After drinking my Amanita-camomile mixture, I decided to smoke a bowl. That is when my cognitive abilities went kapuut. I couldnt figure out how to inhale (or for that matter what I was doing). I decided to smoke a cigarette at this point. That is when the most intense nausea I have ever felt kicked in the most intense nausea I have ever felt kicked in. Funny thing, no matter how hard I tried I couldnt vomit. Well, I probably could vomit if I knew why I was sitting in front of the toilet. Then the hallucinations kicked in. I saw layer upon layer of colors around objects, and then the colors would devour each other. Lights became bright, and sounds became menacing. I started listening to the stereo and I lost all ability to count time signature. I decided to lay down at this point. From that point on it is all a blur. I hallucinated at the cost of feeling like shit.<!-- . . . . . . . This combo is for you -->"

Woodrose,"I did Hawaiian woodbaby rose too much    I\'ve had limited experience with psychedelics, just occasionally at parties and once in Kenya, then I discovered Heavenly blue morning glories (hbmg) on Amazon, I assumed it wouldn\'t work, my thought was come on it\'s off Amazon, so I weighed out 10g and was blown away, the walls were moving trees we\'re shifting, it was unreal.    The problem I found with HBMG was that you had to take so many seeds to get an effect, the chewing just killed the trip for me, then I discovered Hawaiian woodbaby rose seeds (HWBR), I only had to take like 10 seeds and I was good to go.    I jumped on eBay ordered some and took 10 for my first go, my mind was taken away my thoughts we\'re so weird things merged into other things, I was going through loops in my mind, I found it amazing, I waited two weeks between doses and I did a lot of doses, I was so taken by how easy I could get it and how fun and mind-altering it was, then it got bad, really really bad.    I decided to take my usual of ten seeds chewed one up, left it in my mouth for 5mins waited another 5 mins did another, it took about 40mins till I started feeling something but it was different I felt nervous which I often feel super happy when it starts to kick in, I put some music on to help me drift off but I couldn\'t shake this feeling and I started to think about really dark stuff, I couldn\'t stop thinking about how pointless everything is, how one day I\'m going to die, how everyone I love will die how after everything I do it will all be over and none of it will matter to the conscious thing that is me, it\'s been months since I last did psychedelics and I\'ve not been able to shake this feeling, I used to wake up with a feeling of pure anxiety and fear but I\'ve gotten better, I don\'t think I will ever be able to move past the feeling as I feel it every day and it\'s a very real feeling, I know psychedelics are meant to show how the world really is but I was shown a very dark side of reality.    Don\'t take this as a warning not to do psychedelics I had a lot of fun doing them I was just shown reality in a very dark way.<!--I would just warn to make sure you\'re in the right headspace and be ready to be shown something that might be more real than you expected.-->    I\'ve stayed away from these seeds for a while and I\'m going to do them again soon but this time with NOS (also know as laughing gas), which I feel will make the experience more interesting, I will write back here when I\'ve had the experience.

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    I had never got the satisfaction of a inner spiritual journey through my experience with shrooms mdma lsd25 1plsd 4acodmt. So I decided maybe LSA would do the trick.     I had been experimenting recently with LSA but never got much more than a belly ache and a sedated like high. This time though....oooooooh boy.

111987,Great Trip and Euphoria!,Miss Unknown,"Jun 7, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Caffeine,"I\'ve hallucinated and had visuals on 10 Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds before but, this experience had less of that. At 20, it was weird?! As of the time of the experience I was having only closed eyed visuals and everything feels off in a good way. I took a pill that claimed it has 300 mg of caffeine instead of chugging an energy drink or having a bunch of coffee.     Just the two combined brought greater euphoria, normally they both cause euphoria on their own but them combined caused a greater euphoria. Now, no open eyed hallucinations have happened but the colors of everything also seem off.    This has to be at least the twelfth time on my experience with LSA. Maybe have done it about 20 times at a high estimate. I have lost track of the number but, try to keep the experiences no more than once a month or so. I get really bad vasoconstriction when I experience LSA/hawaiian baby woodrose seeds in high doses and learned over the internet that\'s dangerous so I limit experience with this great substance I limit experience with this great substance.    The taste of those disgusting seeds is also one of the downsides. It\'s better than doing it with morning glories though. Those hurt my stomach a lot more.     I never have a trip sitter while doing psychedelics, I just try to remember that the hallucinations I am having ARE NOT REAL and try to act pretty normal.     Overall, I have gotten what I wanted out of the experience and that was my creativity back because I use psychedelics (LSA most of the time) to get my creative burnout to go away when it happens. This really helps with a creative job that I have and when I really, really need ideas."

I\'ve smoked pot about several times but that\'s it. I purchased some HBWR seeds online and the day they came in the mail, I was really excited.    At 3:30 p.m. I took 9 seeds. At around 5 I started feeling intense euphoria and found myself on the ground happy as can be. This lasted until around 7:30. I started becoming super paranoid and nausea started to kick in. I went to the bathroom and threw up everywhere. I was horrified and took a shower to clean up. In the shower I spoke to god. He gave me insight to all my life problems and I felt as if I could solve any problem in the world.    I became frightened. I thought I was gonna die if I slept. My skin was weakly numbed and I was shaking. I laid down to sleep at around 10:30 p.m. And could not sleep. Finally I fell asleep around 1 or so.    These seeds are scary in high doses."
46990,Dissociated State,Dariah,"May 21, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Preparation:  I Put the seeds in a cup of water, nuked it in the microwave for 2 minutes,  drank the water, chewed on the seeds, spit the seeds into the cup, then finally chugged the whole disgusting mixture.      T: 00 -ate the seeds    T: 30 minutes  Walked around outside, felt really restless, felt like I was walking on air... Eyes were completely dilated.  Queasiness that was present while going up, but nothing unmanagable.    T: 3 hours  Peak,  Queasiness is fading, feelings of dissociation are very strong... I remember looking at my hands and not realizing they were mine as they typed.  Time passed EXTREMELY slowly, walking caused some trouble... couldn\'t quite get my limbs to do what I wanted them to do, so I just stayed in my chair.  I put some music on, but my mind completely tuned it out.  No visuals, except for some dancing purple blobs on the tv screen.    Things definately became more noticable-- I noticed my carpet was really sticking up funny.  Also, my depth perception got really fucked up-- Everything looked completely flat.    I was on a plateau until about 6 hours, when I fell violently ill, then proceeded to throw up.  After throwing up I felt extremely drunk, and couldn\'t walk straight.    7 hours-  Laid down to try to sleep... Time went very quickly while I was awake.  I didn\'t end up falling asleep until about 14 hours had passed.    The next day I felt extremely lethargic, and moving about was difficult.  The day after that I nearly felt normal, and 3 days afterward I felt fine.    The throwing up bit was a bit unpleasant, and whenever I think about that trip I can taste those nasty seeds and it makes me cringe in disgust.    I probably should have soaked the seeds overnight or something to extract the LSA, so I wouldn\'t poison myself.    I learned my lesson, and I won\'t be doing it again."

Man it sucks.    2 hours into it I\'m in the bathroom, the nausea is horrible, although I am tripping    3 hours, I take a couple drags of a joint to help the naseau, it helps, but...    4 hours into it, the weed wears off and the nasaue is back, holy crap it sucks.    from now on, I\'m sleeping and waking up and going to the bathroom and then sleeping again. <!--My advice: Don\'t do HBWR...Maybe I just took too big of a dose and I should have peeled the seeds...oh well.-->    Believe me, this shit was not worth it."
34174,A Lousy Trip,deadstarz,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"I was bored and wanted to trip on something besides DXM, so I ordered some H. B. Woodrose seeds from the Internet. They seemed like they were the real deal from other users.     When I got the seeds I wanted to take them but wasn\'t sure how many I should take so I just popped three (after scraping them to remove the fuzzy shit) and chewed them til they were pretty well chewed-up then swallowed it. The taste wasn\'t as bad as described I had also taken 1 Dramamine to ease to nausea from them. I have never tripped on LSD or any drugs like that except the DXM .     After taking them I felt really tired and fell asleep after about to hours. I didn\'t feel much nausea or feel that much different just tired so I laid down to meditate and to wait for them to kick in but I fell asleep waking up disappointed feeling no hangover-like feelings.    The next night I took 5 seeds and a Dramamine and forced my self to stay awake:    11:50pm - took five pre-scraped and opened, seeds on a half - empty stomach     12:30am - slight nausea and dizzynes(slight!)tired like hell so I took a caffeine pill    1:30 - got up felt less corrinated,weak and off balance and a little light - headed    1:40 - I eat a vitamin c pill to hopefully help out as I heard about online                         2:30 -  still nothin different. Same old shit just tired even more like feel weak,lazy, mind is going a little like past dreams I had that I might have forgot, but thats mainly it. I may waited another hour to be sure I wouldnt miss something before passing out to sleep (I\'m kinda hyper from the caffeine but still tired as hell)    3:20 fell asleep nothing great or worth the money. I was thinking maybe I didnt take them right or if I\'m supossed to hold them in my mouth for a period of time or even the seeds arent too potent, well whatever it is I\'m still gonna try to trip from them maybe I gotta take 10 or something but that overkill from what I read.    All seeds must be diffrent. Id like to get a hold of something real good. I got some 2c-I I might do tonight. If I do take it ill be sure to write a review on it."
14205,I Noticed Some Beautiful Flashing Lights,Mack,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Very Much Like LSD    I have had many experiences with quite a few pschoactives (LSD, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Ketamine, DXM, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, and Marijauna to name the basics).  After reading up on LSA extensively online I decided to get some Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and try it.  I usually have a pretty high tolerance to most drugs and decided that twelve seeds would be best for me.  I crushed the seeds with a hammer, poured them in some orange juice and drank the concoction; it didn\'t really taste bad at all.  Directly after I took some dramamine and heart burn medicine and then waited for the affects.           My sober friend wanted me to go out to eat with him so we did and on the way there I noticed that something was different.  Colors were getting brighter and I was laughing about everything.  When we got to the restaurant I was feeling rather inebriated and the experience started to get intense.  As I ate a couple bites of my food I began to get very hot, sweaty and sick at the stomach, so I decided to go wait out in the car for my friend to finish.  While in the car I began to feel what was almost exactly like the early part of an acid trip.           When my friend got out to the car I asked him if he would mind driving me around for a while and he agreed.  We rode for what seemed to be hours and eventually stopped at a park that had hiking trails and got out.  We walked for a short while and I didn\'t seem to have much energy, so we returned to car and decided to go home.  I was now feeling like I was peaking of about five hits of acid.  Just before we arrived home I noticed some beautiful flashing lights; which meant we were getting pulled over because I threw my cigarette out the window.  I was quite amazingly able to talk to the cops and seem fairly sober.           After that experience we finely made it home and I laid down to watch my Moby DVD.  I was really tripping hard.  this lasted for another three hours or so and I really enjoyed it.  It seems to me that LSA is a very potent and enjoyable pschoactive that is on par with LSD and I will definately do it again multiple times."
68340,This Is Honestly the Best Drug Ever Imo,J,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Previous experience with drugs include:  Ecstasy, Ketamine, Shrooms, LSD, GHB, Coke, Crack, Crystal Meth, DXM, DPH and 5-MeO-DiPT    I am a huge fan of 5-MeO DiPT as well which I would liken H.B. Woodrose to the most.  Next to that, its more similar to shrooms as opposed to acid in my experience.  Its less trippy, but its got an even better body high.    On that note its incredibly tactile.  It makes touching things feel extremely amazing.  Its also an incredible aphrodisiac.  It made me very horny and I just wanted to find someone to make out with. Unfortunately I was taking it in the wrong setting for that, will definitely have to repeat in at a club or rave setting sometime soon.  The personal sexual experience I had on it I would liken to one while on crystal and ghb, ie amazing and overwhelming but in this case much less sketchy.    Pleasure in everything was increased, besides touching, food and music were enjoyed to the fullest.    Not much of a head trip, which is a good thing depending on what youre looking for.  It just helped me notice the pleasure and joy in all that life had to offer.  Also made everything seem to slow down.    Visuals were like 5-MeO DiPT but not as intense.  Everything was fuzzy and warm and candy like in appearance.    I absolutely loved it, will repeat but next time I want to share it with someone.<!--Would recommend it to anyone on this site.-->"

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]    I bought approximately 16 of the seeds at a local shop that sells herbs and they suggested that I buy Hawaiian Baby seeds rather then Morning Glory seeds because one needs less of them to achieve the same high.     I started taking 2 at a time every 20 minutes until I reached about 14-16 seeds. At first, my stomach hurt and ached for about an hour and I felt really uneasy almost sick. After about an hour I started getting mild hallucinations, got a bit happy, and started feeling almost drunk and was feeling good. 2 hours later, I started puking uncontrollably on myself for hours, started having a severe panic attack. The pain and confusion was so uncontrollable that I actually tried to kill myself. The night ended with me being taken to the hospital in an ambulance.<!--These seeds are beyond disgusting and I would never recommend them to anyone.-->"
71561,6 Hours in Hell,Anonymous,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"About 3 months ago, I took 6 seeds at around 10 PM.  It was probably one of the stupidest things I ever did.  At first I felt a little giddy, but everything took a turn for the worse.  We all (my sister and her boyfriend took them too) sat down and watched American Beauty.  Seeing as it was hilarious, I was pretty slaphappy, but then the violent ending sent me spiraling into a bad trip.  I kept running into my sister\'s room the whole night because I was absolutely terrified.  I knew nothing bad could happen, but I was still so scared that I was thinking of hanging myself.  The room was slanted, and the doors and walls had gray lines moving across them, thus making them look like they were moving.  I was freaking out until 4 AM, when I finally fell asleep.  My parents were disappointed, and didn\'t trust me for a long time.  It is not worth it.  The high is nothing spectacular, so it is definately not worth the risk and side effects.<!--If you decide to take it, be careful and ready for the consequences.-->"
15184,Euphoria but Not a Trip,Ali,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Due to my lack of funds for mushrooms and unavailability of LSD, I decided to try a different way to trip.  After research and reading the numerous submissions of others, I decided that H.B. Woodrose would be the most effective for my purposes.      I ordered a bunch of the seeds and my buddy Dave (about 200 lbs) and I took off the outer layer and ate six each at 4:00. (I took a Dramamine a half hour earlier) I crushed mine with a spoon and he just popped them in his mouth and chewed them.  Knowing that it would take about two hours we played cards for a bit and waited, Dave hoped to throw up so he\'d at least know something was happening but neither of us even felt nauseous.      We both ended up just falling asleep and napping and waking up at 7:00 to the call of smoke offerings.   After we smoked, four of us went to the ghetto beaches of South Boston to play Wiffleball.  By then, when I guess we should have been peaking because we were there until about 9:00 all we had was a little bit of a body high, which could have been from the weed.  We felt a little euphoric but that was the extent of it.      So after a brutal game of Wiffleball (Dave and I kicked some ass) we went back home, smoked again and I decided that I was determined to trip on these seeds.  At around 11:00 I ate nine more to hopefully feel something.  (Heres where I was curious and skeptical because the inside of some of the seeds after taking off the outer coating was yellow and in some of them it was gray.  Im wondering if maybe only one of them would classify as a good seed or not.) At 12:00am I had some stomach pains so I got a little hopeful that maybe they were working.  I baked some chocolate chip cookies and two of my friends and I just hung out, me waiting and hoping to start tripping.  Never happened.  I was dosing on and off, trying to stay awake and then decided at 3:30 to give in and go to bed since I had to be at work at 8:30.    Ill probably try them again because I have a bunch of seeds left but overall, it was a disappointment.    CONCLUSION: These seeds put me to sleep."
77938,Seeds Didnt Work Again!,learner,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"This was the second time that I\'de ever tried ingesting H.B woodrose Seeds. The first time I took them, I took 8 seeds (recommended common dose) and only felt weird with no effect other than that. This time I figured that I would take 8 again and increase the dosage by 8 seeds every hour or so. I decided to go to my favorite mountainous area to enjoy the trip. I spent some time meditating, then I took a nap in the warm sun. At some point I felt quite weird and sluggish. I ended up taking 24 seeds over the period of 3 hours with no psychedelic effect. Afterwards I went home and told my roommate that the trip was a bust. I spent the rest of my night in my room feeling quite depressed and uneasy. I also felt this the first time I had ever ingested the seeds. This time I had taken 3x the recommended dose without any effect. I ordered the seeds off the internet.<!--and would not recommend anyone wasting their money.-->"

I didn\'t want to eat the white stuff, it can make me really sick. Then I grinded the seeds, and ate them.<!--Tips for all you beginners, if you eat a good healty breakfast and dont eat untill you eat the seeds. The chances of puking is far less.-->    The first signs of tripping was showing in about 1.5 hour, I felt really high. Then all of a sudden I was knocked down by HBWR. It did reminded me a little of ex, but the euphoric feeling was a little stronger and came in waves. After 3 hours I was tripping my balls of, everything was so good and lights were so strong. All of a sudden the room started shaking and then stopped. This happened several times. Everytime I looked at my friend his forehead was growing really big and then really small. I was laughing my balls off! I cant really explain this any better, I would recommend this only to people who has tripped before. Its easy to get paranoia. One thing I really liked was that at the end I could really relax with my weird vision. Hehe"
64130,"Not for Me, Sickening",cammie,"May 20, 2018",H.B. Woodrose & Morning Glory,"I was origionally wanting salvia for a psychoacive drug, but the seller gave me a little bag of morning glory and h.b.woodrose seeds crushed and mixed with my order. Willing to experiment, I tried it, eating the whole little bag chewing carefully and often holding under tongue just in case I needed to. I had forgotten I had to have dinner with my family and was called down 30mins later. I had an huge loss of appetite and really didnt want to speak a lot. Ate a yogurt and a little dinner and went to bed for a restless night.    About 1 1/2 hours I was very ill which happened right after a cigarette. I layed in bed feeling awful for another hour or so being more sick. But I then started seeing visions of my past and seeing weird places in my head. I was dylerious and very confused about who I was thinking that possibly if I died, everything would end and nothing would exist if I failed to, since I thought everything was just in my head. These thoughts continued throughout the night and I managed to only catch a couple hours sleep. I was useless from exaustion the next day and to this day, anything that resembles the seeds slightly (dry healthy cereal and bug grub from crickets) I am reminded of the experience and made dizzy.    Personally, never again and sticking to salvia now."

My head and body felt very heavy while I was  laying down and tounge felt like it was getting huge. There has been a lot of nausea. 15 min ago I puked and the relief was only brief. 1 hour before eating seeds I had a BBQ sandwich, a glass of wine, and then took two dromamine because I herd that HB woodrose was natorious for nausea. My girfriend took 4 seeds 45min after me, she had a salad and also the dromamine. She also is very sick. Never Again! This took 10 min to type. NEVER AGAIN!!!"

92853,Camping Trip,Tripper,"May 16, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"The seeds were amazing for me. I took the seeds and proceeded to sit around a campfire with my friends. The seeds kicked in about 2 hours later, and the fire looked awesome. After this I got really tired so I went to bed(I was sleeping in a tent with my friend). I fell asleep very fast, I had some colorful dreams as well. Not to much later my mind awoke but my body was still asleep, a lucid dream state of mind perhaps. I was thinking to myself \'where am I? What\'s going on?\'. It was weird. Then I thought \'am I dying?\' I\'m dying aren\'t I.\' I was completely at peace the fact that I thought I was dying, I was not scared at all. After accepting death I just thought over my life, a very eye opening experience for me. About an hour later I fell asleep. I woke up the next morning wight no hang over.

No nausea, no sedation, no effects whatsoever.

111832,God,Surafel,"Apr 28, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"After my previous experience with the seeds I was left confused and wanting more. It was finally the day that me and my friends were gonna do the seeds together and I was really excited. It was a beautiful day outside and my friend A came to pick up, we start driving to our friend Cs place but A said he was also gonna pick up his friend M who was a stranger to me. We drive to Ms house and pick him up I was kinda salty that M was coming along because I just wanted it to be me and my friends.     We arrive at Cs place and he was already kinda high so we talk a little bit and get straight to action. I brought 50 seeds and I was planning on me taking 20 while they take 15 each (I am so glad M came along now because that would have been a HUGE dose). I wanted to take more because I was convinced that the seeds didnt work  after reading other peoples experiences I was expecting visuals but I didnt get any, I was also close to an ego death last time so I thought if I take 20 Im for sure gonna trip balls. I remember M reading about the seeds online and saying it says 3 to 5 seeds is a good dose for your first time and I was like bruh I took 8 last time and I didnt even trip (I did and I just dismissed it because it wasnt what I expected). My friend A agreed because he was there when I took the last time but he also added that I was kinda tripping a little lol. I was the only one in the room who had previous experience with the seeds so they all just went along with what I said.     Me, A and C take 14 while M takes 8. They tasted horrible so we ate them with some nuts and we smoke a blunt right after to help with the nausea and damn did it work, I threw up twice before because the of the nausea from the seeds while taking a lower dose but after smoking my stomach just felt numb (Thank God). Pretty soon we were all just chilling on the couch and waiting for them to kick in while talking about some random shit.     Around the hour mark we were starting to feel something but we thought we were just high so we ignored it. At the hour and half mark I was feeling some euphoria and I was like finally I guess these seeds do work, I was just there excited to trip balls because I really believed these seeds didnt work before I took them. I started to feel something familiar but I didnt know what it was then I realized that I had been in this state before when I took the seeds last time I realized that I had been in this state before when I took the seeds last time, when I took the shrooms and even when I took some xanax and that shit was FUCKING CRAZY, My normal self has deleted my memories from when I took these substances especially when I took xanax because I literally cant remember anything I did that night expect drinking a milkshake. But now that I was at a higher state of being I could tap in to those forgotten memories and I realized that I was fucking tripping when I took the seeds last time, and what the fuck I did the night I took xanax lol this shit blew my mind right there like I thought these memories were lost forever but I had to be in a higher state of being to unlock them. My Normal self cant handle these things.      Next my friends said I took a nap but I was in another dimension again no visuals just a realization and knowledge that I was God. It was deeper this time tho because I just had so many great realizations like I always believed in destiny, like there was a great force leading my path to somewhere and I saw how God aka me created my destiny like how I set up everything starting from my childhood so that I would end up exactly here it was as if there was a God me which was my higher self and the normal me who was a lower vibration, so I saw how my higher self (subconscious) set up things like making sure I took certain information and ignored others (like how there is so much information that your brain just chooses to process some of it because it doesnt have the capacity to take in every information right at this moment) so that I could be here right now doing exactly what I was doing. Shit was like a really WTF moment and I was awake even tho I cant remember when.     We started listening to music and shit but I was in 2 dimensions, the real one and the one where I was God and I was constantly coming in and out of these 2 dimensions. I started thinking wait if I\'m God then when does that make everybody else? Then I realized that I and everyone didnt actually exist, we were just thoughts in the mind of the all, universe, God. So I wasnt God but God was me and God was everything. I remember being sad that I couldnt take none of this knowledge with me to my normal state because my normal state cant physically handle this knowledge I remember being sad that I couldnt take none of this knowledge with me to my normal state because my normal state cant physically handle this knowledge, but I knew that this is how it is and how it has always been so I just accepted it. Then it hit me, God was calling me to be it, there was no language I just knew. Anyways God who is me but I wasnt it, was calling me saying it was time for me to become it by letting go of me and not only the world but everything I think is reality so that I become God forever. For those of you wondering what it was like being God in my experience it is basically impossible to describe but here is just a small gist in a way my physical mind can interpret. God was just NOTHING, Literally Nothing just awareness no you no \x91I no emotions, no heaven, no hell, no light, Just NOTHING but that Nothing was also EVERYTHING.     This is all I can remember about being God and although I can\'t remember 99% of what happened in that dimension I remember feeling and knowing that what I was experiencing was 100% real like that shit felt so real that it would make reality look like the fakest shit you can imagine. Then I was back to this dimension, reality and I realized that if I become God then I can no longer exist, I would not only die but be erased like I never existed in the first place. The only thing that would exist is Nothing being aware of itself forever and that was the greatest fucking feeling ever, you might think damn that sucks lol I do too but I remember it was just so peaceful. I is not real, I is a character that only exists in my head, I exist in this physical realm but I doesnt, I is not me. I is the ego."
30761,Scary and Unpredictable,alien,"Apr 2, 2018",H.B. Woodrose,"Took six seeds on an empty stomach and waited for about half an hour before I felt the effects. Started getting paranoid and was convinced that my dogs one day old puppies hated me. About an hour later my boyfriend who had also had six seeds decided that he would go for a walk, by this time I was lying on the floor in my room drooling and incoherant.  I spent a good part of the day in this state too paranoid to talk to anyone or answer the door.  When I finally let a friend in he said I looked very pale and I was unable to hold a conversation with him.  He stayed with me untill my boyfriend got home.  My boyfriend who had gone for the walk had a wonderful time, so maybe its better to get out and get with nature, than sit at home and let it get inside ones head!    As a person who has had several trips on cactus, peyote and LSD, as well as most types of recreational drugs I would count Hws as the worst and most frightening drug I have taken.

102267,Could Absolutely Not Stop Smiling and Laughing,back2russia,"Mar 12, 2018",H.B.

I had read experiences about breathing walls and such.... None of that happened to me, but after approximately 3 hours, felt an intense euphonia similar to pure MDMA. not speedy or draggy, just even euphoria unlike  anything else I\'ve taken.  Could absolutely not stop smiling and laughing, over all sense of well being and absolutely no anxiety. <!--Highly recommended as a much safer alternative to street MDMA, which is often adulterated, and you have no idea of what you are getting.-->"
92049,Cut the Brown Coating,Puffy Smurf,"Oct 21, 2017",H.B. Woodrose,Short and simple... I did these seeds two days in a row... first time I ate them raw and felt not so great.  It was okay as long as I stayed in the sun shine.  The next day I got sand paper and rubbed off the brown coat.  What a difference!  Even if they are organic and untreated etc... I will now always ALWAYS take time to thoroughly get that brown stuff off.  Cheers!
33389,Little LySA,Dan,"Sep 27, 2015",H.B. Woodrose (HBW),"Two of my best friends, whom I\'ll call Casey and Clinton, are Hawaiian and on a recent trip to Hawaii Clinton brought back a Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. When I found out about this, I was eager to try the seeds. My first attempts with this drug, however, were unsuccessful. I tried eating 6 of the seeds on two different occasions and had no effects either time.     The third time I tried using this was with 15 seeds, which I chewed and that seems to have made all the difference. I decided to try this one Friday Night, alone at home. I took the seeds at 9:30 and here my trip report begins.    9:30 Seeds taste like shit. I can feel nauseau coming on before I\'ve finished taking them all. Some marijuana would be helpful here.    10:00 I\'m laying on the couch watching television and starting to feel some definite stimulant effects. No visuals as of yet.    11:15 I feel like shit. All of the muscles in my body are extremely tight and I\'m incredibly nauseous. All I want to do is to puke. It feels like it must be two in the morning but the clock still says 11:15.    11:45 Wow. I finally puked and I feel so much better now. Just went from absolutely no visuals at all to being completely fucked. I am tripping really hard now.    12:30 The walls of my living room are melting, bulging out, and they have turned an odd sort of blue. This is very similar to LSD and I will definitely be doing this again.    The trip report goes on after this all the way until the next day at 11:00 when I had to bowl in a tournament. I was still having minor visual distortions and I bowled terrible. All in all this was a good experience and I will definitely be repeating this. It should be noted that the seeds should be chewed. Swallowing them whole seems to have no effect. Having some marijuana (preferably quite a bit) for the experience would most definitely help eliminate the side effects of nauseau and the muscle tightness. 15 seeds was a bit too much for me I think, and the next time I do it I\'ll go back to ten."
68402,There\'s a Demon with a Fork in My Belly,Nokiraga,"Jan 15, 2008",H.B. Woodrose (extract),"I took about ten seeds ground them up in a coffee grinder, then I let them sit in orange juice and a squirt of lime overnight.  The next day I filtered out the most of the larger pieces seed and at 11pm chugged it down.     Damnit! The worst stomach ache of my life!  Torment, hell -- torture.  For hours I went back and forth from my bed to the bathroom to try to throw-up -- but I couldn\'t -- the pain was so intense I tried anything to distract myself from the pain.  I smoked a bowl, pinched my leg, listen to music --  it got so bad I even resorted to looking at porn -- but all were in vain.      There\'s nothing worse than being dead tired and laying in bed with  to no relief."
22380,Felt Nothing,Jon,"Sep 27, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"I decided to try these, I mean, they are a legal high, and cheap, so why not. I got 25 seeds and one night took 6. After 2.5 hours of feeling nothing, I took 6 more and went to bed, setting my alarm for a couple hours so I could wake up to see if I felt anything. and when I woke up, nothing. So the next night I took the rest (crushed them very well, 13) after 5 hours, I never felt anything, not even a stomach ache. The place I got them from looks respectable - so I don\'t know what my deal is."
21435,The Greatest Day Ever,System 5,"Jun 16, 2007",H.B. Woodrose & Venlafaxine,"Well, a few months ago my friend told me she had gotten some of these seeds that made her trip, and me, being very interested in hallucinogens, purchased 10 seeds off her for $10. I took them in school one day at the beginning of 5th hour class of Aerospace(about 10:30 AM, we have block scheduling), the easiest class in the world, we make paper airplanes. For the first 15-45 minutes I felt like I was really stoned. Then I got a bathroom pass because I felt quite sick (everyone else who had taken them threw up). So I went into the bathroom and went into the stall and leaned up against the wall and made up a song about bathrooms and sang that for about 15 minutes, forgot why I was there and then went back to class. This was precisely when my mind went over the deep end.     A few of my friends in that class were sitting around me asking me questions and all I could talk about was fetchup packet airplanes that fly to the bathroom space station with water bottles. Then class ended and it was time for lunch (about 12:25 AM). I left the room to find my friends \'M\' and \'R\' and yelled and fell down. R had also taken 10 woodrose and didnt talk all lunch, he just sat there quietly observing the lunch room while I was walking in circles talking to complete strangers. Then M and I went out to try and get money and I ran into a few of my friends and told them about how I was going to throw up my soul and turn inside out and run around the school.       Now it was time for 7th hour. This is when I started full on tripping (about 1 PM). We were taking a couple tests and the room was dark and all the words on the paper were stacking up and going into the ceiling. I was looking around and everyone was melting and the walls were morphing and spinning and there were all these beautiful patterns everywhere. I talked to the girl next to me who I was quite well acquainted with and had also been in that class on drugs before about what I was feeling. I told her about how I felt like I was a balloon and how I was floating around the room and I was all tingly and I just felt amazing and beautiful. Then I got sick of taking the test and proceeded to just get up and walk out of the classroom and wander around the school for an hour or so. Then went back and got my backpack and wandered around some more asking everyone I saw what time it was.     Now it was 2:50 PM, time for school to end. M and I went outside the school and talked to people about mudslide, this thing that was going on at the school that night. A poetry and music thing where they served coffee and other yuppie type things. I ran into my friend \'B\' who stayed with us the rest of the day. I was walking around and I felt like we were all skyscrapers, I was taking such gigantic steps. I felt like I was 1000 ft tall and I was stepping on little people and crushing them and this made me rather sad.      Later on around 7 or 8 PM, I was starting to come down and I took the 4 effexor capsules and M took 10 woodrose as did his girlfriend \'J\'. As M and I were walking to the school, we walked by a handicapped kid and M walked up to the kid and started babbling to him and then yelled \'Dont talk to me when Im upside down, I do cartwheels when Im backwards! And ran into the grass and did a front flip and then ran out into traffic but didnt get hit thankfully.     We went to somewhere and I met my girlfriend \'JP\' and we were kind of bored. There was an emo kid on the stage singing and M suddenly yelled out \'this kid sucks! Im going to go jerk off on his face\' so he walks up to the stage and just stood there staring at the kid for a couple minutes and then came back and sat down. Then we left and walked to a resturant and on the way the effexor was kicking in completely. It mostly brought back the woodrose as I was tripping again and I felt really emotional and positive and loving. When we got to the restaurant we sat down and ate and talked for a long time and met a cool guy who later on bought us cigarettes and we smoked outside of Mcdonalds for a while and then walked back to the school and hung out with some friends and just talked. We all went home after agreeing that that had been the greatest night ever, for me it was the greatest day ever.     My first real trip and I had a great time with all of my best friends. Overall I give Hawaiian Baby Woodrose a 9 out of 10, the only bad thing was the stomach ache, which eventually went away. The effexor was also quite nice because it brought back the woodrose plus a little extra physical lifts."
12419,Reflections on the Seeds,LookingDistant19,"Feb 19, 2007",H.B. Woodrose,"I have written the following information based on my own and others experiences with these magical seeds. I have found them a wonderful substitute for LSD, in some ways better, and feel a great respect for their power. First, I would like to make it clear that you should read everything you can find before trying any substance, an educated mind makes for a better experience, and helps one avoid destroying themselves or harming their body.    Preparation Information    There are many ways to prepare the woodrose seeds for usage.   (Note: One must always scrape the outer skin of the seeds, until they are tan and smooth. The skin will cause nausea in most people. A file is the perfect tool for this.)    Chewing  The easiest way to ingest. Just put the seeds in your mouth, chew them into small pieces, then swallow. The seeds are very hard, and it will require much effort. The taste is strange and plant-like, and most people seem to be somewhat bothered by the taste. I find that holding my nose while chewing reduces this.    Powder  Grind the seeds into a powder, separate them into small piles, and with a folded piece of paper pour the powder down your throat. Be sure to have a drink with you to chug after you swallow or to help wash down. This method is good for people that are really bothered by the taste, even though it takes more time.     Tea/hot Chocolate  Grind the seeds into a powder, boil waters with the powder in it. Add a really powerful tea, or I would recommend hot chocolate which really overpowers the taste. Then drink it. Note: This reduces the power of the seeds, and the level of LSA you get from them. So I adjust dosage accordingly.     Dramamine: Taking a tablet of this stomach soother is recommended to avoid stomach pain.    <!--Ive read and heard of other methods, but I would recommend trying the above three.-->  Dosage Information    1-2 seeds: Possible Effects include: Slight enhancement of vision, slight increase in speed of thoughts but nothing much else. I found this dosage level interesting for slightly enhancing an activity. However, I believe the seeds are much more useful in higher dosage levels.    3-4 seeds: Possible effects include: Perceptual changes, color and vision enhancement, time alteration, euphoria, slight auditory enhancement, revelations possible, altered thinking, occasional hallucinations. Side effects: slight nausea is possible. It is the perfect starting place.    5-13 seeds: At this point the more seeds I take the more intense the effects from lower dosages get, the more possible for revelations and visual hallucinations. It also becomes more possible for nausea and vomiting. The most intense dose I have tried is 13 seeds. It produced vomiting which Ive learned to deal with, and an experience that is akin to a medium dose acid trip. I have not tried any more seeds then this, due to the intense stomach pain that could result.    My Thoughts  I have used to seeds as a guide to the mysterious unknown. I have discovered many things through these psychedelic experiences, from the mystically profound to the emotionally relevant. They have been spiritual experiences for me opening my cynical mind to the great wonder of shifting reality. I have also seen many powerful visions, both filled with meaning and sometimes no meaning whatsoever. They have given me a marvelous adventures and helped me grow as a person. As old clich says\x85 mind expansion Theres no better way to put it. You must have courage, you must educate yourself, and you must be prepared. Good luck."
11756,Superior to Its Cousin,Mr. Trips,"Nov 23, 2004",H.B. Woodrose,"I scrape the coating and fuzz off the seeds until they are a beige color. Then grind them thoroughly before ingestion or extraction. I encapsulated the seed powder to make ingestion easier.     I am experienced with LSD and Psilocybin mushrooms (both under 5 times each) and all I can say is that of all my experiences on psychedelics, the woodrose LSA trip was by far the best. I ingested the seeds bright and early in the morning. (7:00 AM) I find that day trips are the best. I\'ll briefly describe the effects of the seeds:    Positive effects:   ~extremely intense euphoria   ~Tactile body high   ~strong change in spatial and temporal perception (especially at the peak)  ~psilocybin-like visuals (trails, patterns)   ~Potently stimulant and exciting.     Negative effects:   ~Nausea and lethargy during first hour or so after ingestion. ~Moderate stomach discomfort (gut rot)    My entire experience lasted about 8-9 hours reaching the peak around hour 5. There were no negative after-effects...just drowsiness. Right now, over 30 hours after ingestion, I still have subtle visual effects, but that\'s it.     In contrast with LSD, its cousin, LSA is superior. I will never take LSD again. You couldn\'t pay me to take street acid...LSD is a waste. The trip has a sharp, synthetic feeling that I find very irritating. Lets not forget the uncontrollable \'mind chatter\' and cheap, dirty  body buzz that LSD is capable of. On the contrary, LSA is natural feeling, the high can be easily controlled and it is still very intense. There is no irrepressible mental \'chatter\' but I can still acheive philosophical enlightenment and revelation."
21672,"Not Entirely Positive, Good Outweighed Bad",Charlie,"Nov 22, 2004",H.B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I bought 14 seeds from a headshop in my local town, the guy behind the counter gave me brief instructions on dosage etc, and on the way out I dropped one seed, thus leaving me with 13. I read that a tip was to scrape the white furry coating off the seeds, which I did.      I visited a friend at his university and we agreed to take the seeds together, him, his friend and myself. I was experienced with hallucinogens, namely mushrooms, so I had a vague idea of what to expect. We had a joint at midday, and began chewing the seeds at 12:30, i had 5 and the others had 4.  We began watching a comedy, but after half an hour, we realised that we were feeling something, fairly mild but very disconcertingly unfamiliar.            After around an hour, we had retired to bed, my friend and his buddy in one bed (nothing sexual, we needed to lie down) and I was on a camp bed. We all started to feel extreme nausea, which eventually culminated in all of us vomiting in the toilet (not at the same time). After that the nausea went away slowly, and we were left feeling unusual. My friend reported that if you moved your hand in front of your face it left a trail, which we all agreed with.              We were reaching a relaxing introspective peak, in a dark silent room, when in came my friends flatmate, turned on the light, put her new cypress hill cd on loud (NOT RECCOMENDED) and started to talk about her dissection (she\'s a med student) and how the corpse she was working on had been stabbed in the throat with a biro, and generally other morbid stories. This sent all 3 of us into a state of extreme depression. We eventually (and rudely) told her where the door was and how to f**king use it, and she left. We continued to feel the philosophical effects on the mind for a further hour or so (time is heavily distorted), and I remember being very amused with my friend by looking at the animations on the menu of his nokia phone.     The effects seemed to wear off, and my mates friend went to the pub. I however felt veeeeeeeery tired, and my friend tried to get me to come to the pub, but I refused and he stayed with me and suddenly he felt tired too, ie there was an intense second wave of lethargy (IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER). We slept for a further 4 hours and woke up feeling energised and rested. We went for dinner and found that we didnt have much appetite for food, but a strong thirst. We went to a shop and bought a crate of beer and went back to the flat and had a night in with about 8 guests, smoking cannabis and drinking and listening to music.     Overall, the experience was interesting, not entirely positive, but overall I would say that the good effects outweighed the bad. I just recommend that you dont go outside until you are totally sure the effects have worn off. LOCK YOUR DOOR! And dont play any morbid music, listen to something chilled like pink floyd or jazz or something. Never take it alone, some of the initial negative effects would be terrible if you were on your own, without someone to agree that its normal."
36973,"Beautiful, Tranquil, Amazing",harmsolidsnake,"Sep 26, 2004",Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds,"This was my first experience with hallucinogens.  I got a 1/2 oz of HBWR from the basement shaman.  I ate four seeds after the third quarter of the football game I was at (about 9:30).  I had amazingly high expectations for this.  About 15 minutes later, mild nausea hit me, but nothing too huge.  I marched out with no problems, changed out of my uniform, and drove home.  At this point, I wasn\'t feeling anything at all.  Some friends of mine came over to watch Reservoir Dogs, and the entire time I just laid down enjoying it.  One noteworthy thing is that during the \'Ear\' scene, I truly felt I connected and, to a lesser extent, took on the persona of Mr. Blonde and had a huge grin to express the sadistic glee he was feeling.  After the movie ended most of my friends left, except one, who I\'ll call J.  J dosed 3 seeds at the same time as I took my four.  At this point, both of us had a shaky grip on reality.      We walked around my house a bit, walked outside, talked.  It was amazing conversation, at least it seemed that way.  After about a half hour of that, I looked up at the ceiling and saw many spinning lights, rotating slowly.  I was enjoying the sight of them until J\'s cell phone rang.  It was his dad asking him to come home.  He was able to be normal on the phone, but it was hard.  I nearly panicked, thinking his parents would get caught, but soon I remembered that you have to keep a positive attitude about the trip, otherwise it could easily go bad.  So J went home, and I just assumed he could handle himself, regardless of the fact that our pupils were about the size of dimes.  After he left, I grabbed my CD player with the \'Requiem For A Dream\' soundtrack in it and went outside again.  I headed into a field and laid down, looking at the stars.    The moon was brilliant.  It had gorgeous shades of green, purple, red, and gold all around it.  I just stared at it for about 30 minutes, amazed at the beauty.  Eventually, however, my attention shifted to the stars.  They were rotating slowly.  Very slowly.  It was then that I saw a planetarium ceiling behind the stars,  At this point, I again started to panic, thinking the world isn\'t real, but I got control of my thoughts again.    I just laid there, staring until about 2:00 AM.  I went back inside and up to bed, which is when the worst nausea set in.  I got over to my garbage can, puked, and went to sleep. In the morning, I had a new vision of life.  I lost reality the night before, and it was very nice to have the concrete world around me back for good.  I will definately use HBWR again, but with better preparation and I won\'t have people who aren\'t tripping come over.  Overall, though, it was a postive experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat.  The tranquil beauty of the world on HBWR is completely indescribable."

Chewed em up and swallowed them.  2-5 hours later still No nausea, no high, no nothing... Ok... Maybe I should grind em and soak them.    Next day I peel, and crush, grind and soak 8... Wait 20 hours... Strain it... Drink the liquid... 2 hours later... Nothing... Except wanting to be experiencing it so I\'m trying to force it mentally.. But its not working.      Is eating food a bad thing?  I ate before, and I ate after.. Other people seem to have not had a problem with it...     Maybe seeds not real?  I\'m just curious and confused..."
17373,Hiding From My Wife,HBWR,"Sep 9, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I read all about dosing on woodrose seeds online.  I have tripped on many other drugs including lsd several times in my youth, and I am here to tell you that the woodrose trip is the best ever.  It was evening time at band practice, and I had been drinking beer.  I pulled out my baggy which was filled with 24 woodrose seeds.    I first chewed up 10, and an hour passed and nothing happened.  I eventually found myself chewing the whole 24 seed bag.  About an hour and a half after eathing the seeds, my friend and I went out on his back porch to talk.  I started feeling really strange, and told him that I had better be on my way home.  As I was driving down in interstate, the striping lines swayed and swirled.  I pulled into my drive, and proceeded to enter my home (hoping to god that my wife was not still awake).  When I got into the bathroom, the walls starting breathing and the floor was swirling.  I went and laid down in the bed, so as not to make any noise that would wake my wife.    When I laid there, I would go in and out of extreme hallucination trips.  Two seconds seemed like 10 years.  I don\'t think that I will ever take 24 again, but I will take 15 or so.  I did vomit about midway through my trip, but my sickness went very quickly, and left as fast as it came.  One of the funniest things was that I was worried that 7 hours had passed, and that I would have to go to work like this.  I looked at my watch, and only three minutes had passed.    If anyone is afraid of death, they should stear clear of this drug.  There were several times during the trip where I thought I was dieing, but I really didn\'t care.  It was defenitely like what people call an out of body experiance\'.    I have tripped the light fantastic before on lsd, and lost reality, but the woodrose experiance is the most intense to date."
9361,Never again,Joelle,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"I have enjoyed LSD and psilocybin, so when a friend suggested I try HBW I was looking forward optimistically to a peaceful, colorful, entertaining six hours or so -- a nice walk in the woods followed by a concert.  We peeled/sanded 3 seeds and each ate 1.5.  She had the experience we both expected.  My crippling nausea lasted 12 hours.  If she hadn\'t been in good shape and ready to care for me, it would have been even more painful, plus very messy (she brought me many cups of warm water and helped me puke).    Psychically it was not too overwhelming (for a non-novice) -- it just sucked out loud.  For a total of about ten seconds, I was afraid I was going to die, which balanced the ten seconds (early on) that I actually felt almost good.  I withdrew completely from the world because I felt best if I concentrated on my breathing, which seemed to me to have a bad habit of stopping for short periods whenever I didn\'t pay attention.  Only in darkness and silence was I able to ward off panic.  My hands became numb and I felt cold, with horribly stiff neck and shoulders, but my pulse was slow and regular throughout.  I felt rather stupid for poisoning myself voluntarily for fun, and swore Hallmark-card oaths to appreciate the beauty of daily life and the sub-toxic cheering effects of the local wine (Trollinger -- mmm mmm good!).    My salvation was that I was eventually able to sleep.  When I read that people routinely take 6 or 10 of these things, my mind was blown."
9144,Thick Soup,Jon,"Aug 28, 2002","Salvia divinorum, Absinthe, H.B. Woodrose, & Hashish","I started off by smoking a gram and a half of salvia, I kept questioning, am I feeling anything... is anything different.  I had bought all of the above mentioned drugs at a store in Vienna and now was at my friend\'s appt.  We knocked back the absinthe with his dad, I sat down at a computer at felt very strange, drunk but my mind was still there.  My vision was bright and colourful, but I wasn\'t getting the normal drunk euphoria, just mild illness.    Forty minutes after the absinthe, my friend came in with 3piping hot mugs of Hawaiin Baby Woodrose Tea. I knocked it back and started smoking hash, waiting for the pychedelics to kick in.  Twenty minutes later, my body got very heavy and I felt very nauseus.  I was in a fearful mood of LSD before i took it and was feeling panicky.  The next two hours were intense, I dosed in and out of sleep,feeling incredibly tired and sick.  When i closed my eyes there were no visuals, and my mind was functioning perfectly, but my body felt like soup.  I stood up and was stumbling everywhere, this lasted for 3 more hours, the nausea subsided, and I got control of the trip.    I smoked hash until I calmed down, and then 6 hours after taking the L.S.A. returned to reality.    I learned not to mix that stuff with booze, which is what our supplier told us anyways, but I was to arrogant to adhere to."
9667,Weird,Walks,"Aug 28, 2002",H. B. Woodrose & Cannabis,"I have been looking at the net for some legal entheogens, I have smoked and drunk a lot, and did shrooms once. I really like shrooms but since I live never Newark the only drugs that easy to get are narcotics. I plan to stay away from that shit. I have a freind that get realy fucked up because of Heroin.    Anyway I got a lot of the internet and I read that the amount LSA varies a lot because it is a natural source. The first time I took it I did 10, (removed the white fuzz and chewed it like tobacco) which made me feel really drunk and stoned, but more clear. There was great euphoria and this \'I doon\'t give a damn\' feeling. It last all night. I had minor hallucinations,like when I looked at the stars moved around.    A week later I did 15 at 7:30, and it was like when I did 10 but at 12:00 I took a few hits of good weed and it felt like some one blow apart my mind. I was thinking with three different brains and like last time every five minutes felt like an hour. The three brains I as thinking with were an animal brain over stimulatedby all the talkig and colors, then my creative brain was kept saying these crazy ideas and produced closed eye visions which overlapped my open eye real sight. Then my logical mind which had little control kept me in line telling me how silly my ideas were and that my freinds were looking at me.    I kept fading in and out of dreams, at i think 12:40 I fell asleep. It was the most intense mental feeling in my life. I woke up still drunk feeling but ok and went home. they nice day I had a huge weed over. It was so much fun, but it is a depressant and it is for those that like sitting and chilling.    Tonight I gave 4 friends 12 each, they all got really fucked up but in very different ways. Most were sorta acting like they were drunk  but one kid just sat there all night and at the end said he found the meaning of life, and it was something about not caring. The other three all like it and one said it was the \'best thing ever\'. They all compared it to drunk E.    I think it is great and for about 3$ a trip it is well worth it. it is not for everyone and made me feel sick for the firs 30 minutes but goes away. It is not for everyone and seed to seed vary greatly so 10 off my seeds could be equal to 5 of yours, and make sure to get it through a legal high place because some company put bad stuff on them."
7898,Pretty Euphoric,PacmaniaC,"Aug 28, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"Well, first I really should tell you that this is the first drug, except for alcohol and nicotine, that I have ever tried. I had read in many places that the maximum dose was about 7-8 seeds. My goal with eating the seeds was to get a full blown psychedelic experience, but since I only had managed to get 5 seeds, I figured that would be good enough for the time.     I chewed the 5 seeds well for about 6 minutes and then I took some hot coffe to swallow them. Almost instantly I felt like something was tickeling me inside my head, a little bit like when I haven\'t had a smoke for a big while and then finally finds a cigarette. But this feeling was muuuch stronger and intense. Then I started to feel ill. Almost like motion sickness, but it wasn\'t that bad, I just laid myself down in the bathroom for about 25 minutes and then jumped up quickly, and then I was okay. My arms and legs felt numb and it felt as someone was tickeling them, and the tickeling inside my head continued for about 6 hours. It was also a bit sexually stimulating.    With 5 seeds I only felt good and really happy and euphoric for about 6 hours. It was really worth the nausea, I can tell you that! Next time I\'ll take 10 of them! Its really worth trying!"
15882,The World Cycled With Me,A4R6,"Jul 7, 2002",H.B. Woodrose,"My friends and I have always been on the lookout for ways to cheaply/legally obtain substances to alter out consciences. In May, after coming up with as much information as we could on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, we went ahead and ordered an ounce of them (~250 seeds) from what we believed to be a reliable source. They arrived on my doorstep at about 2:00pm on a friday, while me and two friends (W + T) were there.    We had already decided based on what we had learned that the easiest way to take them would be scratch everything off the outside of the seeds, rinse them under water till they\'re sparkling clean, then crush them up in a glass of water and drink them. I had work less than 2 hours later, but with all my impatience I decided I\'d take some. I had 6, T had 6 (because he weighs less than me and W,) and W had 8, all at about 2:45.    Probobly the only thing that we felt for the first hour and a half was anticipation. A short while after I got to work at 4:00, I started to feel slightly euphoric, and couldn\'t help but smile and laugh every time someone looked at me. I didn\'t start to really go crazy until around 6:00. Thankfully, I had alot of time alone at work that night, because we were overstaffed and there was alot of work to be done elsewhere around the store. As I was running around the store doing various tasks with precision and speed that was very uncommon to me, my mind was working away in the same precise fashion. Every problem and thing I misunderstood just started to solve itself in my head.     Around 7:30, I was sent to plunge the toilet and clean up a big mess in the mens bathroom, which in my current state was a HUGE relief, because I got to seclude myself in the bathroom with the door locked. After making some wierd faces in the mirror above the sink, I got to cleaning up the mess and started wondering what T and W were doing. I knew T had a doctors appointment, so he wouldn\'t be around when I got back. As it turns out, he was tripping balls all through his appointment and through dinner with his family, but no one suspected it. W\'s whereabouts were unknown to me though, and all I could do was hope that he\'d be waiting at my appartment for me when I got out of work, so I could feel the comfort of being with someone screwed up like I was.    At about 8:15 I got home, and there was W walking circles around my house, staring at the ground in front of him, with a very confused look on his face. For the next 45 minutes or so, we desperately attempted to syncronize our thoughts, spouting everything that had happened to us since I left for work, our astonishment at how well the seeds worked, and what we planned to do after that point in time. The only thing amazing about what we said is how long it took to say, due to how excited we were.    At 9:00, we showed up at our friend K\'s house, and desperately tried to repeat all the information we had just communicated at my house to everyone at Ks house. While we were slightly more efficient at communicating with them than we were with eachother, it still took us about an hour and a half to get everyone at Ks to eat their share of seeds. At 10:30pm: P took 12, J took 8, R took 8, W took 4 more putting him at 12, and I took 8 more, putting me at 14. After that, we drove around the city, buying food at gas stations, smoking a bowl or two here or there, frequently making guesses as to how long it would be before everyone else was tripping with me and W.    Eventually, around 11:30, we settled down at J\'s house, had a little bit of alcohol in the form of mudslide, and smoked some more. I believe at that point, me and W would have been coming down had it not been for the weed we were all smoking. Around midnight, everyone started noticing wierd feelings, odd breathing patterns, and cramping in their legs and arms. By 1:15, we were almost all out of our minds, running around the house with no idea what we were doing. J\'s girlfriend and her drunk fat friend showed up in the middle of all this, and started making us all uncomfortable, especially when J\'s girlfriends friend pissed herself.    At around 1:30, it started raining heavy outside. It was also rather cold, so I suspected I might get hypothermia out in the rain and not notice, but I ran out there anyways because it looked fun. P and R followed me about a block down the street while I swung and twirled a big broom stick all around like a staff. R turned back, fearing the cold, while me an P wandered about and changed between deep conversations about life, observations of our current state with the seeds, and some fighting words.    We planned on brawling once P was tripping as hard as me so that we could test our strength, but we got distracted by the departure of the two girls, and ended up following them down to the gas station at the end of the street. As we continued our conversation, it started to lose its words, but we didn\'t stop communicating. We just felt eachother thinking, and only barked a few words here or there to keep the flow going. For some reason that I cannot explain, me and P got really \'upset\' about the time the girls went into the gas station, and started screaming obseneties in the direction of the gas station. This caused quite a commotion, and upon hearing sirens, me and P fled the scene quicker than we ever could while sober. We jumped over fences and ran up steep hills like it was nothing.    When we arrived at J\'s house again, soaking wet, we decided it was time to go to sleep. J was in the corner pissed off because he claimed to feel nothing from the seeds. Everyone else was asleep or just staring at the walls. P found a spot to sit down and started to watch the posters on the wall come alive. I did the same from 2:30 until about 4:30am, standing or sitting by the heater, trying to dry my clothes off.    As I looked around the room, I thought about all the different aspects of my life, and all the different futures that could be. As I cycled through each potential offshoot of my life, the world cycled with me. My vision was tinted with bright colors, corresponding to every different scenario that I forsaw. My perception of time just blurred into nothing, and all I felt was the steady rhythm of the world and the colors changing with every pulse.    Someway or another, I went straight from that experience to waking up laying in a puddle in corner of the room closest to the door. We all got in R\'s car and he drove everyone home. During the ride, we all just sat in awe of what had happened to us the night before and listened to the music on the radio.    Since then, I\'ve given other people seeds and had wierd results. The smallest number anyone has ever felt anything from is 4, while a few people that took between 5 and 9 claimed to have felt nothing at all. I suppose there could just be a difference in quality between the individual seeds. That along with all the other variables like body weight and what theyve been eating makes the outcome very shaky, but overall the seeds work very well, and last a good long time. A few times, people have gotten really sick from the seeds, but I suspect its due to their inability to carry out my instructions on cleaning the seeds before they consume them. Once, someone took 16 seeds without breaking them up, and they didnt kick in for 6 hours afterwards, but when they did, he tripped a long time. simply chewing the seeds and swallowing them rather than drinking them in water seems to take the same amount of time to kick in, but causes more nausea. Its possible that just the bad taste causes the nausea, but I can\'t really assume that.    To anyone who tries these things, be VERY SURE to get ones that aren\'t chemically treated, and are from a supplier that you trust.  Also, make sure they are clearly indicated as \'HAWAIIAN BABY woodrose seeds.\' If you have the chemistry know-how, and would like to regularly ingest them, I suggest extracting the alkaloids from the seeds and taking it in a purified form, because the poison thats in the seeds could possibly do cumulative damage to your health if you take them alot. Overall, the best advice I can give anyone is to BE CAREFUL. Good luck."

6523,LSAyahuasca,Renwick</A,"Jul 24, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds & Syrian Rue,"After ordering a large number of Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, a friend of mine asked me if he could have seven of the seeds to try. I gave them to him with the promise that he would call me the next day and tell me how they were.The next day my friend called me and told me they didn\'t work. (Days later found out that he didn\'t chew the seeds and that was why they didn\'t work). I proceeded to call another friend and ask if he wanted to try an experiment with me. The experiment I had in mind was consuming 10 Woodrose seeds as well as five grams of Syrian Rue to potentiate the Woodrose seeds and make sure that they would work. My friend agreed, so I picked him up and we went to the park to ingest the seeds.     After arriving at the park we chewed up and swallowed the seeds. The Woodrose seeds tasted slightly like peanuts and the rue tasted like old coffee grounds. We continued walking around the woods and half an hour later the effects started to kick in. We ran into some kid who had a pipe with him, he looked like he was hiding from someone. My friend and I wandered around for a few more minutes before we agreed that we were getting way too high to be walking around the woods and decided to head back to the car. As if to confirm my suspicions about the boy we saw earlier, the next person we came across was a police  officer. By this time we were very high, but decided we needed to leave anyway due to the presence of the cop.(DISCLAIMER: The author of this report thinks it is a bad idea to drive under the influence of any psychedelic or intoxicant and does NOT suggest that anyone do so.)    The drive home was crazy. Trees melted into the road,  colors changed and altered in intensity, and an incredible   nausea was growing in each of us. We arrived back at my friend\'s house and sat down on his couch. I was growing more nauseous by the second and crawled my way to the bathroom to vomit. After vomiting up the entire contents of my stomach and then some, I crawled back to the couch. I was overcome with a strange urge to sleep and could hardly keep my eyes open. This was very different than my previous psychedelic experiences where I felt incredibly stimulated and unable to close my eyes or sleep.     An overwhelming sense of fear came over me. Thoughts such as \'did I poison myself\', \'if I go to sleep will I ever wake up\', \'do I have serotonin syndrome\', and \'am I going insane\' all crept through my mind. I began freaking out more than I ever had before. I wondered if there was some reason I had never heard of anyone doing this combination of drugs before. I tried to use the computer to search for answers but it was impossible.     My friend tried to calm me down but eventually I just accepted my \'inevitable death\' and laid down on my friend\'s bed. A few minutes later I was happy to realize that I couldn\'t sleep at all and was afraid for no reason.     The visuals were very different from the neon visuals of LSD or the sea green and earthy colors of mushrooms. I watched the colors form before my eyes mostly in shades of red, gray, and blue, with a small amount of yellow. After a while my friend came in the room along with another friend of mine who was there to drive me back to my place where I\'d feel safer. The first friend said he would meet us there in a few minutes when he could get a ride with some of our other friends. I happily ran to the car and drove off with the other friend. The car ride was semi-hectic because my friend drives pretty fast and we passed several cops, one of which looked like he was following us.     We arrived at my place only to find that my brother was there and needed the insurance card for my other car because he had gotten pulled over while driving it. I had to dig through my wallet for this card while tripping so hard I couldn\'t read anything, which took quite a while. My brother had brought an annoying friend of his over who kept asking me questions about the trip. An hour or so passed and my other friend showed up with some more people, and my brother left. I took out a cigarette and decided it would be a good time for a smoke. All of a sudden I saw my body decaying and growing sick and saw all of the future consequences of my smoking flash before my eyes. I threw my cigarettes in the garbage and never smoked again. I sat on my bed talking to my friends about life, death, and other weird existential things that come to mind while tripping.     I tried to relax my mind into as much of a meditative state as I could, this was a challenge being as hyper excitable as I was. All of a sudden a strange feeling came over me and I felt as if I had been reborn and now shared some strange bond with all the people there that I still cannot describe accurately. Somehow, I knew that that was exactly how I felt when I was being born. It was an incredibly weird sensation. The rest of the trip consisted of talking with my friends and lying in bed. The next day I felt incredibly shaken and worn out but not bad.     Over the course of the next months I made many changes in my life. I changed my major in school; I broke up with my girlfriend, and changed in many other more subtle ways.The friend that I tripped with also made many changes to his way of life. Subsequent experiments showed me that Woodrose Seeds cause a lot of nausea by themselves but not nearly as much as when they are taken with the Syrian Rue. Also the Syrian Rue adds a blue color to the hallucinations not normally found with the Woodrose Seeds alone. The significantly higher with the Rue."
7753,Woodrose + Shakti = +4 flirtation,dmtg666,"Jul 1, 2001",H.B. Woodrose Seeds,"Last night my roomate and I (Both musicians) attended a live performance of John McLaughlin\'s current Shakti ensemble of out of this world Indian cats. I have had many deep experiences listening to the Shakti material McLaughlin produced in the 1970\'s, including my first mystical experience which has shaped my life wonderfully; this occoured when I was 16 listening to Shakti for the first time and smoking some marijuana. So, we decided to take some woodrose seeds to enhance the experience. We each took the seeds gound up and swallowed in gel caps (3) at about 6 pm. At seven  we smoked a huge spliff and hopped on the subway to get to the theatre. By the time we got there and picked up our tickets I was starting to feel the effects:  giggling, desire to mess with people\'s minds(benevolently), perceptual changes, ect. We laughed excessivly and rolled around in the grass until we were allowed to go to our seats.    We got to our seats (great view) and settled down, doing some rythmic breathing/chakra/third eye meditations to get the most out of our perception enhancement excursion. Soon the concert started,  and I must say, the experience entirely escapes description with language. I cannot think of a more perfect type of music, with the symmetries, geometry, and general rythmic sophistication of Indian Classical music, with which to have a psychedelic experience. I say I was flirting with a +4 nearly the whole concert. (I have only had one solid +4 before,with the little purple Hawaiian Panoleus specimen) The amount of information on a cosmic level that was present in this music was beyond belief, and I know that all sorts of information about everything was being downloaded into my brain. I had insights about yoga, attention, focus, and time that were beyond precious. I am at a loss to explain how important this experience was, though I know that you who have had similar experiences will know what I am saying. Truly ecstatic. Anyway, I strongly recommend the music of Shakti for psychedelia, especially the new albums and the live album from the 70\'s, with which I had my first mystical experience aformentioned. (the song title says it all: What need have i for this, what need have i for that, I am dancing at the feet of my lord, all is bliss, all is bliss.)    Love ya,   Tom"
