15902,Psychohedron,Hiab-x,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIf the <a href=\'http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=15729\'>\'Umpsquamadic Peel\' trip was the definative \'Bad Trip\', then \'Psychohedron\' was the definative best trip I\'ve ever experienced.  It happened in September 1993 when a small party of friends and I decided to go mushroom picking at Cheddar gorge in Somerset UK.\r\n\r\nWe\'d arrived at the gorge in the early afternoon in the peak of mushroom season and driven along  the winding ravine road until we reached a secure \'non public\' area away from the tourist attractions in the town of Cheddar some two or three miles away. We found an ideal spot for picking mushrooms, set aside from the main road and shielded by a thick hedgerow which concealed our illegal activities of gathering the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nWe spent the best part of the whole afternoon finding groups of Liberty caps dotted in clusters on the hill. By the time the dusk had begun to set in we had somewhere in the region of 900 mushrooms stock piled so we set up camp and pitched our tents in readiness for the evenings psychedelic voyaging.\r\n\r\nWe each had 100 mushrooms  brewed into a rather unpleasant flavoured tea which kind of reminded me of the taste of long life processed cream mixed with a dollop of mushroom ketchup. But, it was customary to forgive the taste in acceptance of the visions that would come as a result of drinking the brew. In good spirits we waited around 45 minutes before the shrooms kicked in .\r\n\r\nBy the time it was completely dark, the only light in this countryside setting was that of our modest campfire and a slightly blueish tinge to the cloudy night sky. It mattered little, the group and I began to trip . At first the initial \'coming up\' phase of the drug induction was the closest any of us got to indulging in hedonism, laughing and galloping around over the hill, feeling the mushroom inebreation taking hold and distorting physical sensations.\r\n\r\nI had begun to notice that the sky had developed a complex geometric pattern which span in  kaleidoscopic formations, to me it looked like thousands of cat faces twirling around in the air. (I\'ve submitted an image to the <a href=\'http://www.erowid.org/culture/art/\'>visionary arts vault called \'Kittydelic\' which is a pretty accurate translation of the initial hallucination). Some immeasurable time later my visions became so potent that I was forced to go back to the tents and sit down  as it mattered little if my eyes were open or closed the pictures were the same intensity regardless. From this point onwards I couldn\'t say how long I was gone for or how long the entire trip lasted, time was obsolete. \r\n\r\nI became a disembodied observer of a psychedelic visual storm, the only emotions I now recall were those of wonder and amazement. Before me was a crystaline structure, perfectly symmetrical, like an icosahedron made of precious stone spinning at a dizzying rate on more than one axis . As this gleaming jewel spun itself, its structure would morph into more complex shapes, its entire colour would change through rich myriads of spectrum colours.\r\n\r\nAdded to the complexity of this object was the breathtaking way it would emit annimated rays of what appeared to be some form of language. I\'ve tried to illustrate this with little success, the language pouring off the crystal shape looked like a mixture of organic circuitry combined with Egyptian heiroglyphics.  While this visual spectacle progressed, I was aware of an audio tone which seemed to ascend from being a static \'Hiss\' to a high pitched \'Whine\' similar to that which is heard when one has come home from a rock concert with temporarily impaired hearing. At the peak of the higher pitch the spinning jewel exploded and left in its wake an even more potent vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was now staring into an infinite structure, a matrix of interlocking bars made of a glassy substance, the structure was completely built up of elfin like faces with rainbow coloured gasses swirling around within them. The structure had a fluidity to it, there was nothing static about its appearence other than the constant barred form of the matrix itself. Each happy face would warp and morph into another, each transient mouth would open and chatter a visual language which rather resembled micro fireworks exploding a short distance from the faces which produced them.\r\n\r\nIn my own awareness of self, I was only aware that my perception had become part of the very same structure I was observing, I remained in silent awe and tried to make some form of sense of the chirping electronic sounding bleeps coming from each face. I think I was aware at my surprise of how electronic the noises were at first, then I became intensley aware that my perception of the noises was beginning to shift, it started to sound a lot like human voices as if I were listening to a crowd of people all chatting at once.\r\n\r\nThen the noises began to unify into one resounding voice, I could now hear a chorus of words. This is a close approximation of what I could hear \'I am the psychohedron - I am every thing that ever was , is and shall be . Everyone and everything are all part of me ...\'  It made sense, in that innate way sense does when having a psychedelic revalation, I did not, could not question what I saw and heard.  I felt in that timeless moment nothing but absolute truth.  It was deep-seated knowledge, it had bypassed any ego formed sense of doubt or suspicion.\r\n\r\nFrom my vantage point It could be no other way, I felt its truth because I was in that space part of it all... I find it very difficult to find the words that could even convey that feeling of \'Truth\'.\r\n\r\nI simply understood. \r\n\r\nAlmost as quickly as I had entered that moment within the vision, the structure began to alter, as if to demonstrate exactly what It had meant. The elfin bars and intersections warped, curved, folded into new shapes which then began to have a very distinct familiarity, I soon recognised that one of the diagonals that had formed was the edge of one of the tents. One of the smiling elfin faces became familiar, it was my friend sitting opposite me, another part of the structure suddenly looked like my arms and legs before me. I couldn\'t bring the vision back or resist the transition, within a very brief time I knew I was back at the camp, sitting in the entrance of my tent surrounded by other friends who were also coming back from their trips.\r\n\r\nIt had always been an established fact amongst my tripping companions that I seemed to be the person who usually  experienced the most potent and powerful visuals. I tended to find that surprising, I had always assumed that hallucinogens would affect others to the same degree. As the mushrooms wore off and I lay in my sleeping bag awaiting sleep, I was fully in awe and aware of a final residue form the mushroom intoxication.\r\n\r\nIn my mind I could hear a symphony that was more tremendous and complex than any piece of music I have heard in my life. It would be futile again to find the words but I could prompt you to imagine hearing an envigorating classical symphony which is played by the finest orchestra in the world . These musicians are then accompanied by an underscore performed by the finest musicians of every culture on the planet, the result of this is not a meaningless cacophanny but a beautifully paced rhythm that conjures a profound sense of magic, that conjures an inner sense of complete harmony. This harmony extends beyond the self, it embraces everone on the planet and fills the entire universe with joy, the joy of existence and being.\r\n\r\nWithin this masterpiece I recognise, or at least sense, that music from every era in our history has somehow been infused in with the rhythm . Well, thats as good as I can get to describing what I heard after the psychohedron had dispersed itself and I began to fall asleep.\r\n\r\nThe following day, after arriving home, the name I had been given was something I could immediately work with, I checked in the dictionary for the word \'Psychohedron\' to no avail, however \'psycho-\' as a combining form deriving from \'Spirit , the mind.  And \'hedron\'  deriving from \'geometric solid or shape\' also as a combining form pretty much meant that making the new word \'psychohedron\' denoted mind or spirit shape.\r\n\r\nAdding that into the context of what had been witnessed the night before I felt that the message I had heard was absolutely self explanatory. A few years later after a number of tried and rejected rough sketches, I managed to put 37 hours into a pen drawing which I have also uploaded to this site. The image is called <a href=\'/culture/show_image.php?i=art/hiab-x_psychohedron.jpg\'>\'Psychohedron \' and gives a very accurate rendition of what I saw, minus the glassy substance and rainbow gasses . I\'m quite pleased with the illustration none the less. \r\n\r\nDo I believe that what was revealed to me in vision that night as true? I\'m inclined to say yes, yet at the same time I\'m equally open to the notion that the great spirit allowed me to visualise something of a translation of an overwhelming truth, that the structure was a divine way of helping my monkey mind see something that ordinarilly exists beyond my human comprehension.  In other words, the visual aspect of the Psychohedron was not literal, it could have been metaphorical. I don\'t expect to really know until the day I die.\r\n\r\nIt\'s also worth noting that a few months after that fateful night another vision came to me whilst I lay on the threshold between awake and sleep.  I became intensely aware of a noise I can only describe as akin to hearing an aeroplane coming in to land above ones head. As this noise happened internally, although I could say it was loud , It would be absurd to say deafening .\r\n\r\nAs the noise reached its climax, from the darkness of my closed eyelids I saw a shape appear from the blackness. It was the glyph-emmiting crystal . It seemed to be a few feet away in front of me, slowly rotating on its \'Y\' axis. I noted that the surface had a pattern very similar to ripples you see on the surface of water, but in the case of the crystal, the patterns were in a vibrant myriad of spectrum colours. No sooner had I begun to comprehend what floated before me, the shape rapidly vanished backwards into the darkness of my closed eyes and was gone. At which point, fully awake, I sat up and was left to comprehend what had just happened .\r\n\r\nI haven\'t taken any hallucinogens now for nearly a decade, I feel that to take LSD or Psilocybin mushrooms again would be comparable to trying to upgrade the RAM in a computer that has already had its RAM upgraded. I\'d still be very open to trying Peyote or DMT, but sadly as I have no sources for either substance and live in the UK, it presently feels unlikely that the opportunity will arise unless fate decrees other wise."
95565,A Late Beginning,Nowhere Girl,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nAt first I thought not to submit my report \x96 I\'m very happy about having had this experience, but I don\'t consider it so special or very deep. However after two days I thought otherwise \x96 maybe it is indeed \x84special\x94, because it can emphasize the importance of having a good guide. Thanks to my guide, I was able to have a very positive experience \x96 albeit also very mild \x96 despite having clearly not an optimal starting point. Thanks to my guide, I was able to have a very positive experience \x96 albeit also very mild \x96 despite having clearly not an optimal starting point. Therefore I will have to write a long introduction about my \x84set\x94 and the whole history of my fascination for psychedelics. I remember this story very well because I have been keeping a diary since the age of 9.\r\n\r\nI\'m a 30 year old woman, but my interest in psychedelics first sparked when I was less than 13. Since that day, I have been waiting for my first trip for 18 years and 10 days. The story of that first day of desire in brief: for already some months prior to that day, I had already been experiencing some temptation for drugs. Reading made me grow up \x96 or maybe rather feel like growing up \x96 too quickly. I was reading a review of a 1977 album by Aerosmith (at that time my favorite band), \x84Draw the Line\x94, and the review said: \x84Even the title shows that the drug period in the band\'s career is starting\x94. I didn\'t know what this phrase meant, so I decided to ask my mother, who yet spoke English better than I did, hoping she won\'t notice that this subject feels tempting to me. She also didn\'t understand the phrase, however she tried guessing what could it mean and so she said something that would come to influence my whole life: \x84I\'m not sure, maybe it\'s about that drug that produces visions? How was it called? LSD?\x94. At that moment I knew: yes! how can I be curious about speed when there is something like this... This moment came to be so important that years later I still tried several times to describe that feeling. \x84It is like sexual orientation: you don\'t have to try anything to realise\x94. Or: \x84These words that produce visions\x94. Or: \x84Sometimes you don\'t choose your desires and interests \x96 a sudden flash, a discovery that some area of life exists, and you are hooked, desire is building a nest in your heart...\x94.\r\n\r\nI wrote that I had been waiting for my first psychedelic experience for \x8418 years and 10 days\x94, but it doesn\'t mean I immediately realised I was waiting for something. I was as influenced by the predominant beliefs that taking any \x84drugs\x94 is wrong, as most people are. At that point in 1994 I experienced my temptation as something disturbing, something I have to resist. In 1996, after a calm period, this feeling got so strong that I swore \x84never to try drugs\x94 \x96 not \x84officially\x94, I\'m not into organised spirituality and other groups where you can make such a promise and be praised for that \x96 but still I treated it very seriously. The problem was that the temptation remained very strong \x96 I was actually trying to prevent myself forcefully from taking any drugs. In 1997 I started reading Tom Wolfe\'s \x84Electric Kool Aid Acid Test\x94, one of the two books related to psychedelics I had at that point (yes, I knew perfectly well it\'s hypocrisy to swear not to take drugs, but keep reading such positive texts about them). It seems that was the first source that made me learn that psychedelics can be used for more than \x84fun\x94 or \x84lovely images\x94, that many people were using them for purposes of spiritual experience or self-discovery. I kept fighting my desire for several more months, already \x84out\x94 about my problems to closest friends. \r\n\r\nA breakthrough came in August, at the age of 16. Maybe it was too much despair, maybe I arrived at a point where the only choices left would be suicide, madness \x96 or this breakthrough. Within just a few days I went from my struggle to a complete enthusiasm and belief in the deeper meaning of psychedelics. I convinced my closest friends to the same opinion and my first conscious waiting period began, because I decided to try a psychedelic after I turn 18.\r\n\r\nThree months before my 18th birthday, in March 1999, reading Romantic poetry brought another breakthrough: I decided to pursue a mystical experience \x96 but without \x84external help\x94. My pride made me do it. I wrote something like \x84Maybe in face of such experiences pride vanishes in the sun of the Spirit, yet I want to achieve this experience without helping myself\x94. I never did \x96 I had something reminiscent of a deeper spiritual experience, but later I also got more interested in other topics, such as politics, sport and my studies (literature). And so I spent six years almost completely without the desire to try psychedelics. Sometimes I referred to it in my diary with irony or with a certain \x84respect for the revolutionary spirit\x94, but actually taking a psychedelic remained far outside the scope of my plans.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 the desire suddenly came back after seeing an exhibition by a certain Polish artist, who also presented video documentation of his psychedelic experiments. I kept struggling again for some months \x96 now with a different reason, the belief I may be predisposed to a mental illness \x96 but in 2006 the decision was already \x84yes\x94. And so the last period of my waiting began: the period when I wanted this experience so much, but felt I don\'t have a chance, simply said \x96 an \x84opportunity\x94. \r\n\r\nHowever, any time I got closer to having an opportunity, I always felt that I\'m scared, that maybe I have been waiting too long, that maybe I subconsciously want to wait forever. In 2008, through forum comments to an article about the death of Albert Hofmann, I came to know K., who would later become my friend and guide. It still took a few years \x96 at first because he didn\'t trust himself enough to act as a guide (now he turned out to be an excellent guide), later because he wanted me to be sure or because he doesn\'t \x84deal with supply\x94 and I couldn\'t find a \x84source\x94. Yes, maybe I indeed used it as a perfect explanation for prolonged waiting...\r\n\r\nNow about my mental state. I don\'t have any genetic predisposition to a mental illness \x96 in fact I\'m psychologically so different from pretty much everyone in my family that I could have thought I was adopted if I didn\'t look very much like my father did (he died 10 years ago). However, some aspects of my behavior should raise concern. I\'m very withdrawn, sometimes spending whole days, when I don\'t have professional obligations (I work as a translator), just alone at home, playing old games and writing or reading my diary. I tend to move between extreme introvertism and extreme extravertism, as if I was desperately trying to establish contact with someone when I find an opportunity. I have problems controlling feelings like anger and frustration \x96 sometimes, when I simply miss a bus, I find myself, for a while, shouting things like \x84How could I have thought I had a right not to be late!!\x94. However, I never consulted a psychiatrist \x96 out of my hostility for this profession and plain fear that I could be forced to take some medication \x84if the diagnosis found something\x94. I even have some level of distrust for psychologists and have never formally consulted a psychologist since my high school period \x96 also because I felt that his or her reaction to my desire to try a psychedelic would be all too foreseeable... (In 1997, right before my breakthrough, a friend told me that maybe I should \x84find a good psychologist who wouldn\'t tell my parents and try doing something to stop wanting this experience\x94 \x96 and at that point, in so much despair, I already felt: \x84No, I don\'t wan\'t to lose this desire, I feel I would be poorer without it!\x94.) So I have always tried to deal with any psychological problems I may suffer from mostly by myself.\r\n\r\nI also have a good starting point for developing psychological blockages. On the other hand \x96 these are things I can\'t consider pathological and it\'s a political decision: more precisely, considering asexuality a valid orientation/choice. I feel psychologically unable to have sex and I strongly believe the most important thing is that I accept it, I have no desire to change it. I have never had a strong libido, but I also admit, when pressed, that I probably identify as asexual partially due to some level of not accepting my body (I rather say I have to feel anger towards my body) \x96 obesity and, first of all, quite severe and uncurable allergy. But, as I wrote in my diary last year, \x84Life gives us a chance through various circumstances, positive, negative and in between. We can\'t change some presumptions, but we have a chance to make use of them in the best possible way\x94.\r\n\r\nI\'m also a decided feminist, quite obsessed with cultural and social presence of women. It is also able to complicate my experience: I always felt to some extent troubled by the question \x84Why are there so few female psychonauts?\x94 I always felt to some extent troubled by the question \x84Why are there so few female psychonauts?\x94, I felt I have to prove that we are not afraid too \x96 a rather hopeless task when you are actually afraid...\r\n\r\nSomething else: through all these years spent waiting I have written much (mostly in my diary) about \x84psychedelic theory\x94. This experience, so far always absent, has already influenced my life to a very high degree. It surely has a positive aspect: even before my first psychedelic experience, I was already able to integrate some psychedelic insights as theory. An important declaration I wrote (again, in my diary, but I read and rewrote it to some people): \x84There are practically only two possibilities. Either my way of experiencing the world is absolutely Alien, my sensations are unsurpassably Different Sensations and the society has every right to call me insane. Or we all experience this mad intensity of the world, infinite diversity of moments and this is THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN HISTORY. Billions of lives! (...) And all of this \x96 forgotten, without cultural or historical meaning! An infinite ocean of temptations and terrors, visions and vanities, winters and warms, a true Universe within! This is what history is made of, not of sterile actions, not of abstract thoughts! (...)\x94. Maybe I easily adapted some aspects of psychedelic discourse \x96 and maybe I did something much worse: I plunged into psychedelic theory without any emergency exit, without knowing what to do if the Experience would come to be a total, painful disappointment. \x84It would be as if a huge piece of my life was torn away from me\x94, I wrote. Luckily, it was not the case, but maybe taking a psychedelic when having such feelings is reckless. Altogether, it\'s clear to see that I\'m a very complicated person, often unable to come to terms with myself, torn between conflicting thought-feelings.\r\n\r\nNow I can finally get to describe my set directly before the trip. But yet something more: I have hardly any real experience with milder psychoactives. I\'m quite a heavy tea drinker, but it\'s mostly for taste \x96 some are caffeine-free herbal teas (however, I always drink black tea or yerba mate in the morning). I never drink coffee \x96 I simply dislike the flavour. Other caffeinated drinks \x96 quite rarely; once, after an energy drink, I felt stimulated to the degree of feeling unpleasant, I discovered I couldn\'t stop talking and never tried such beverages again. I have never tried tobacco (apart from sometimes being, unfortunately, forced to be a passive smoker \x96 but I always avoided it the best I could due to my allergy). I have tried various alcoholic beverages, but have never been drunk. In Poland it\'s not illegal per se to let a minor try a bit of alcohol \x96 as long as the child doesn\'t get drunk or get into trouble, it\'s rather up to the parents\' discretion. So quite early I was allowed to try a bit of wine, beer, champagne, eggnog, and able to decide I definitely dislike the taste. Probably the last time I tried alcohol was at 19 \x96 I tried cognac, couldn\'t draw a breath for a while and decided that I really hate the taste of alcohol, I scorn it as a psychoactive and I\'m proud to remain an abstinent. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 14 I tried ether once \x96 I had access for a short time, found it too tempting to resist and took a whiff \x96 yes, this was enough to feel altered for a few minutes. I almost got caught by my mother and later didn\'t dare to try it again. I tried cannabis a few times, but it never really worked \x96 even when I took it orally. Many people find it hard to get high for the first few tries, so it\'s not that untypical \x96 the really untypical thing is to have a mushroom trip without even having experience with cannabis. No experience at all with other drugs; I\'m scared of depressants and avoid any sleeping pills despite some sleep disturbances. In the last few years I \x84discovered\x94 the idea of \x84drug orientation\x94 and thought: yes, that\'s it, even though I\'m a theoretician, my drug orientation is psychedelic.\r\n\r\nI spent last New Year\'s Eve alone, felt depressed and finally told myself to call some common colleague of K. and myself and ask him whether he could help me \x84find\x94 some mushrooms \x96 I just couldn\'t stand the thought of perhaps spending another year waiting in vain. Two weeks later he gave me the telephone number of some other person, whom I visited. I bought some mushrooms, also received a few coca leaves meant as a source of spiritual energy and we also had quite a nice conversation which helped my prepare myself, too. As for the number of mushrooms: it\'s hard to say, because the mushrooms had been picked last year, some of them had already been consumed and what was left were mostly stems with quite few caps (well, not \x84just a few\x94, but clearly less). R., who sold me the mushrooms, said he will count two stems like one whole mushroom \x96 altogether I bought about 45-50.\r\n\r\nLater I called K., told him I have the mushrooms and in March we decided the vernal equinox should be a good time. Here it showed again  that the closer I get, the more I am afraid. I could call it the third struggle: after the struggles between sacrifice and desire (1996-1997), between supposed contraindications and desire (2005), this was the final struggle between fear and desire. I feel I have to emphasize it, even risking presenting myself as a reckless and immature person, because it shows even more the importance of guiding \x96 as I wrote, it turned out to be possible to have a good trip even with such bad preparation. Anyway, on the last day before the trip I felt terribly frightened, felt I have pretty much no positive reasons to try, only negative reasons not to give up (such as: it will be even harder to try again, I may never be able to really prepare myself...). In the evening I prayed for confidence and woke up next morning feeling subtly better: still quite nervous, but not scared. However, as the evening approached, as I was leaving for K.\'s home, I felt worse again, I thought repeatedly, even though not fully seriously, of turning back and going home.\r\n\r\nK. is an experienced psychonaut. He started  with a bad yet profound high-dose LSD trip, but later went on to have mostly very positive and spiritual experiences with substances such as salvia, cannabis, ayahuasca, San Pedro, a few research chemicals and \x96 only once \x96 mushrooms. I was very sure I want to try mushrooms as the first psychedelic because I consider them the perfect start: they are relatively short-acting, easier to dose (you know how much you\'re taking) and to prepare, well-studied (at least compared to some of the newer discoveries such as most psychedelic phenethylamines \x96 still I would try them, but not right now) and don\'t have very strong physical effects such as nausea. Actually in my case the physical effects were quite strong, but I didn\'t experience them as too unpleasant or frightening.\r\n\r\nSetting: just an apartment \x96 with some disorder typical for a home that hasn\'t been cleaned in the last few hours, but also a makeshift altar on the floor. Some syncretism typical for psychonauts, \x84new-age\'ists\x94 and other people who don\'t care about being accused of \x84supermarket spirituality\x94. Later K. also turned off all electric lights, leaving only two candles as light sources.\r\n\r\nI still felt very insecure when I came in. K. turned on some music \x96 Tibetan monks singing. At this point the music sounded very gloomy to me \x96 I\'m noting it to show how much would change later. Also encouragements felt uncomfortable at this point, as if I was being pressured to try and had to stand up and leave if I decided to give up. But again \x96 these encouragements just worked.\r\n\r\nPreparations: K. laid the coca leaves on the altar and kept singing mantras over the mushrooms, candles, incense, \x84entrusting the traveller to their power\x94. Around 8:10 pm he went to  the kitchen to boil some water for the mushrooms. When it cooled down a bit, he poured all the mushrooms into the water (we were a bit worried not to lose the active chemical. Theoretically Psilocybe semilanceata contains mostly psilocybin and just a little psilocin, and psilocybin molecules shouldn\'t be damaged by heat, but in the experience of K. and his friends, a high dose of boiled mushrooms wasn\'t really so intense). \r\n\r\nAt this point the rituals seemed to start working: I was less anxious and asked K. to give me the cup. However, I was still afraid to take all the mushrooms. At this point I probably took no more than 30 mushrooms and around 2/3 of the water from the cup. K. told me to chew them well and I did, which probably accounts for quite fast onset of effects. I swallowed the mushrooms with some pure water and, after going to the bathroom, went back to sit on the mattress and wait for the effects. K. also ate a bit of the mushrooms, but rather \x84symbolically\x94 \x96 it was too little to feel any effects; however he said that for the whole day he felt somewhat altered, maybe because of the equinox time.\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure what time it was because I took off my watch, there was no clock on the wall and K. encouraged me to leave problems such as time behind. I think it must have started around 9 pm. At first I felt some tingling of the fingers and feet. I was a bit worried if it may be allergic (I have had an acute allergic reaction four times in my life and it\'s one of the most terrible things I have ever felt), but K. told me not to think about negative things. Probably at this point he gave me a crystal to hold and asked me to touch my forehead when I would know it was beginning. The tingling feeling indeed started turning into something else, into shivers, mostly of the legs. I found it hard to keep sitting and had to lie down under the sleeping bag. I asked K. to give me my eyeshades and I wore them. \r\n\r\nAt first I wasn\'t sure if it was it, I was having a bit of normal afterimages from the candle flames and street lamps outside, but later something else started to appear. At first some simple, symmetrical pattern in shades of gray, then a red and green mesh. It was really a magical moment, something unique \x96 in that moment I knew it had really started \x84and I was in for a ride\x94. This \x84inner space\x94 had a third dimension, it was as if this little world before my closed eyes had turned into a dome, with images appearing and shifting inside it. These visions were rather simple patterns, very delicate, even volatile. They never turned into more complex images, but it was so new \x96 so first \x96 so unknown! I think at that point I took off the eyeshades again \x96 even out of sheer curiosity, to see how the outer world looked like. Changes weren\'t very pronounced \x96 it was a bit hard to concentrate on a particular object, everything seemed quite more detailed (even the rather ugly dirty-brown sleeping bag \x96 the fabric was really shiny, later, after \x84landing\x94, I wrote: \x84it seems colorless again\x94), I wasn\'t sure if some little details had been there before \x96 but nothing spectacular. At that point I found it hard to speak, but I muttered something like: \x84And I was so scared...\x94. And: \x84It\'s really hard to say what is really the Change\x94. K. answered: \x84Yes, that\'s it, that\'s what it\'s about!\x94. When thinking about this experience now, I could say: I do believe in the Word, in the possibility to tell even things usually described as ineffable \x96 not necessarily directly, maybe through metaphor, poetry... But all the trip reports (and, as a long-term theoretician, I have read hundreds of them before I took my first trip) are usually quite good at describing what happens. What is really hard to say \x96 is how it feels.\r\n\r\nI think at that time I decided to go to the bathroom before the effects get stronger. I found walking a bit awkward (immediately I also realized I wouldn\'t feel able to write; I wrote down the diary version of my report after coming down) \x96 some weakness in my legs and maybe even a little sensation as if the floor was moving. However, when in the bathroom, I found out I\'m still able to almost \x84switch off\x94 the effects when necessary. Everything looked ordinary, my reflection, apart from dilated pupils, was normal too. Later, when I was already coming down and went to the bathroom again, I had a funny little hallucination (?): I saw a small black spot moving across the bathroom rug. I\'m still not sure if it was some little insect or a hallucination.\r\n\r\nBack in the room, I immediately laid down again. I felt so fascinated that I\'m finally having this experience, however there was also some uneasiness. In the beginning I was a bit scared when looking at K., his face looked somewhat different. I strongly felt I have to get used to this new world, I was a bit worried what will be when it gets stronger. But the experience remained mild all the time. Later I felt some regret over not taking the full dose, but it\'s surely better than being nervous about having taken too much... I already wrote how scared I was despite wanting this experience so much, so I just wouldn\'t dare to take more, even if now I know better... However I soon felt there\'s nothing to be afraid. There was some feeling of astonishment over all that led me to this moment \x96 arriving at K.\'s home, all my nervousness of the previous week, even the \x8418 years and 10 days of waiting\x94. It all seemed so far away...\r\n\r\nAs for the sensory effects, auditory and tactile sensations were most enhanced. I was still having those shivers, my legs were trembling with the rhythm of the music. It felt as if some unknown power had taken control over my body, yet it wasn\'t frightening. (I have a feeling that when you are able to shed your fear \x96 or simply not to be afraid \x96 almost everything can be fascinating and non-threatening, just by being so different from everyday experience.) Music sounded different \x96 very spacey, three-dimensional \x96 and no longer frightening. It would be too much to call this feeling mystical, but there was something mysterious, something significant about this experience. With my eyes closed I wasn\'t sure what was happening around me, where K. was. Sometimes I had the feeling there must be someone more in the room. And, first of all, my body felt very different. The feeling of blurred edges, as if I could no longer tell where I was beginning and where ending, the sensation of sinking into the mattress... Consciously I knew everything was in its place, but still there was some feeling of surprise when I for example rubbed my feet against each other and discovered they were still there.\r\n\r\nMost of the time the feeling that I \x84can\'t lift off\x94 remained, however I must also have resisted on some subconscious level. I guess it\'s not easy to really let go when it\'s the first time, when you are only getting used to \x84how it feels\x94 and learning that \x96 at least at this point \x96 there\'s nothing to be afraid of... Later I thought boosting might help, so I took that little bit of mushrooms that was left. I think the total dose was at most 40 mushrooms, likely closer to 35. Anyway, the extra dose didn\'t have much effect. I think at that point I was already starting to come down, even when I didn\'t know how much time had passed. \r\n\r\nK. encouraged me to look at some mandalas he had. Again, I wouldn\'t call this sensation mystical \x96 rather captivating. I remember him saying things like \x84Attentiveness. Joy. Love!\x94. The experience never became truly spiritual, but was first of all beautiful and happy. I feel purified from all that fear and bitterness that had accumulated with my waiting. The experience never became truly spiritual, but was first of all beautiful and happy. I feel purified from all that fear and bitterness that had accumulated with my waiting.\r\n\r\nI remember that later K. asked me, half-joking: \x84So, how does sex look like from this shamanic point of view?\x94. I answered something like: \x84It isn\'t necessary. These energies exist anyway and one only needs to be able to realize it\x94.\r\n\r\nI \x84landed\x94 around half past 1, so the trip lasted about 4,5 hours. We spent about an hour talking and then K. went to sleep in the other room and I wrote the report down in my diary before also being able to sleep for some time. I woke up shortly after 7 a.m. and went back home. When still waiting for the tram, I called another friend and told her that I\'ve had this experience and \x84haven\'t gone crazy or jumped out of the window, as you can hear\x94. I felt strange, but in a positive way \x96 again, it seemed so far away that just the previous evening I was travelling the same route in the opposite direction, feeling so scared... I wanted to speak about this experience \x96 at least to people I trust, so I called the persons who helped me get the mushrooms to say thanks to them. Now... at times it again seems so far away, so unbelievable that it really was there... I think that after years of waiting and writing \x96 hundreds of times \x96 things like \x84maybe I\'ll never try\x94, it\'s hard to get used to not having to yearn anymore. \r\n\r\nThe trip was far from a mystical experience, yet the feeling I now sometimes get reminds me of something I have read in Huston Smith\'s \x84Cleansing the Doors of Perception\x94: \x84In the Ch\'an/Zen tradition, early texts (...) tend to cite satori as the goal of training. (...) When satori first arrives, its momentousness is likely to make it seem ultimate, the be-all and end-all of existence. (...) At this point enters the realization that comes to be stressed increasingly in later texts. In those texts satori is not the goal; it is the first major hurdle in the unending endeavor to work the satori experience into the fabric of one\'s daily life until one\'s entire life takes on a satoric quality\x94. This is something I will have to think about. I will have to learn to really be more attentive, not to have the whole experience of life pass me by.\r\n\r\nI also want to try a psychedelic again, this time a higher dose \x96 but I realize I will have to think all those things through anyway. The first time was a bit as if K. had done all the work for me, but a truly fruitful experience doesn\'t come for free."
113246,Meeting the Mushroom - Breakthrough/Possession,Oliver,Psilocybe semilanceata,"\nThis particular report is what I consider my first true trip, though I had ingested liberty caps from the same batch twice before. For some background, the first time was only one mushroom and had been largely unremarkable, save for some increased visual acuity and pattern recognition. The second time was about 1.5 grams, though this was eyeballed, as once again I hadn\'t bothered to weigh out an exact amount. This trip proved to be full of thought loops, but overall ended up being very positive and useful in that it familiarized me with the mental space. I should mention that this trip, along with all of my others save for two, was done alone. This is simply my preference, as I find I just worry way too much for my friends or get too caught up in conversation whenever we have tripped together.\r\n \r\nNow, to the actual trip in question. I was back at my parents\x92 house for the weekend. I had tried cleaning my dorm room, but it still felt too dirty and cramped. I felt like the room I grew up in was a nice alternative with much better energy. I had ground up my remaining 4 grams of mushrooms, as I had recently read about taking them in a lemon shot. After taking a shower and letting them soak in lemon juice, I downed my little magic concoction at precisely 9:00 PM.\r\n \r\nT+ 0:00\r\nThe taste of the mushroom dust mixed with the lemon juice was one of the most vile things I have ever had. I don\'t mind the taste of mushrooms just by themselves, and I have never tried making tea, but the sludge I managed to force down was on a level of nasty I had never experienced before. With more experiences under my belt, I now know that this particular batch just really didn\'t taste too good. This quickly came back to haunt me. Either way, I managed to down everything, said good night to my parents, shut my lights off, laid down, and pulled up some good old Terrence McKenna. Naturally, I don\'t agree with everything he said, but I have a deep love and respect for Terrence and his brother. I was drawn to what he had to say because I also always wanted to experience true visions, and I\x92ve always been on a slightly mystical streak. Much like how the older generation had reacted to Huxley, I heard the things he described and also simply thought ""gimme that, that\'s what I want"". More specific to mushrooms, I also wanted to test if the claim that they can speak was true. Experiencing both of these things was my goal for the night.\r\n \r\nT+ 0:15\r\nI do not remember exactly which talk I was listening to at this point, but I\'m almost certain it\'s the YouTube video titled ""How to use psychedelics / psilocybin / magic mushrooms remastered"". Some would say it\'s stupid to set up expectations for yourself when taking psychedelics, but this did a lot to get me in the proper mindset to trip. Of course, I can only speak for myself. I made sure to do this on an empty stomach and I know my body has a high metabolism, so it didn\'t take long to start feeling the fuzzy, weighted embrace of the mushrooms. Still, I had been struggling with the taste and the lemon-mushroom mixture was making my stomach churn. I was psychologically ready and willing for what was about to happen, but I had never had to struggle with nausea like this before. I had no bud on hand and didn\'t feel like getting up to get anything else to fight the nausea, so I just sat with it and tried to tough it out.\r\n \r\nT+ 1:00\r\nI was fully immersed in the experience at this point, but still fighting ever-increasing waves of nausea. I was fully immersed in the experience at this point, but still fighting ever-increasing waves of nausea. I was trying to keep everything in my stomach for as long as I could manage, but I had the intuition that eventually I would just have to jettison everything. Now, I wouldn\'t label myself an overly superstitious person. I firmly believe in the rules of evidence and the scientific process. However, at the same time my parents taught me the value of a spiritual life. I\'ve changed my beliefs and my world-view countless times by now, but never once have I been convinced that there isn\'t more to existence. Since this trip, I have gotten really on-board with the idea that certain plant-teachers encourage vomiting to rid you of bad energy/spirits/thoughts, whatever you want to call it.\r\n \r\nEither way, in my pain and struggling I was too distracted to focus properly on the experience, and all I was getting were very dark and confusing thought loops. I was angry at the psychedelic community for lying to me, then angry at myself for maybe just not being cut out for this stuff, and then finally angry at the mushroom for not giving me what I wanted. For the first time in my life, I managed to convince myself that life is nothing but a cosmic accident, order is simply an illusion necessary for survival, and existence is truly and completely devoid of any meaning whatsoever. I felt alone, completely defeated, and absolutely out of my league. I was genuinely worried I would be stuck in this pit of anger and sadness forever. I think this final thought-loop was what really crossed the line, because at that exact moment the nausea became absolutely unbearable and I rushed to the bathroom. The next 30 seconds were followed by violent and difficult vomiting; however, I immediately began to feel much better. I went back to lie down and drink a lot of water, hoping I had absorbed enough psilocybin to continue the trip.\r\n \r\nT+ 1:15\r\nI really dislike the excuse that words simply fail when describing the psychedelic experience. Not remembering is understandable, but if you really don\'t know what words to use then it\'s simply a matter of learning and practice. Granted it\'s difficult sometimes, but with the right metaphors and a sufficient vocabulary, it\'s certainly possible. In fact, I would argue it\'s necessary. I regret to say that from this point on, I do not remember everything that happened anymore. Nevertheless, I will do my absolute best to describe the things I do remember. It is also around now that I completely lost track of time, although I admittedly have a pretty loose grasp on that to begin with. I\x92ll continue to provide time-stamps but keep in mind these are only approximations.\r\n \r\nI felt pretty sobered up after vomiting, and for about ten minutes I was convinced the night was over. I was a little disappointed, but at least I felt alright again, and I simply decided I\'d try again another day. It didn\'t take long to realize that there was no way I was going to sleep anytime soon. The next thing I knew, I got well and truly blasted off. I became aware of a presence that was not in the room, but not in my head either. It felt loving, intelligent, unbelievably ancient, and most of all unmistakably alien. This was a presence that was at once part of me, yet completely incomparable to human intelligence. Once I acknowledged this presence and reached out, the real show began.\r\n \r\n~T+ 1:30\r\nFirst came the patterns, which began as geometric fractals with a distinctly organic feel to them. There weren\'t really any colors just yet, at least which I can remember, but it didn\'t take long for everything to ramp up. Once I began to lose myself in the patterns, I noticed I kept losing more and more control over my body and I began to roll around on my bed and drool. Quite honestly, it felt a bit like being a baby again. Of course, my immediate question to this presence was ""what are you,"" to which I immediately received the almost hokey response of ""I am you and you are me"". Regardless of what I was talking to, I was honestly kinda unimpressed. I wanted to be more certain that this was more than some random new neuronal connection, and that I wasn\x92t just talking to my pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus, or something. Something that felt so completely alien could not possibly be me, yet on some level it felt as if it had always been there. It was probably just trying to ease me into what was about to happen.\r\n \r\nI forget what the next couple exchanges were exactly, but I know I had a lot of questions about what it meant to exist and what my role was in a universe so much bigger than myself. At some point, the patterns in my mind froze in place and color began to seep in. What I saw looked a lot like the pattern on a blue tie-dye shirt, though the blues on this field were so rich and vibrant you really can\'t make sense of them unless you are in that state. It is very much like trying to describe color to a blind person, only sober you is that blind person.\r\n \r\nThis was the prelude to what I can only describe as some kind of inter-dimensional song-and-dance. This was the prelude to what I can only describe as some kind of inter-dimensional song-and-dance. It felt very sensual and playful, but still very careful. Participating in and being present for this show caused things to reveal themselves in greater and greater levels of complexity. The gradient of the blue field began to ripple, and I got the impression of a sheet or a veil that was having wind blown over it. After the rippling came rotation, first slowly but eventually reaching cartoonish levels of speed. Once it had begun rotating fast enough, the geometry came back but with a much more urgent and wild intensity. First came a spiral, then many other patterns that I don\'t remember, and this culminated in what I can only describe as a spiders web fractal.\r\n \r\n~ T+ 2:30\r\nAs these patterns continued to rotate, everything began to pulse slightly. This pulsing felt very comfortable and joyful. With the pulsing came recognizable images from our own world, and it was at this point that I managed to completely let go and lose myself. I can remember that I was drooling uncontrollably as I began chewing on the corner of my blanket. I wouldn\'t say I remember more than 5% of what I was shown, but I do remember lots and lots of pine trees, carved reliefs of sunflowers, many different types of birds and other small woodland  creatures, rotating 3D crystals made of perfect geometry, and then finally 9 men on bicycles riding over mountains formed in the strands of the web. It feels worth noting for some reason that these men bared a striking resemblance to the design of the famous Bicycle Day artwork, though they weren\'t exact replicas.\r\n \r\nAt some point, I started crying from the beauty and meaningfulness of it all, though I realized I still didn\'t have what I was looking for. Tears of ecstasy quickly became tears of sadness again, and as I began to sob quietly things reached peak levels of weird. My arms were no longer my own, and my tongue moved without any input from me. The voice that came out was still mine, but it was not me doing the talking. The entity/alien/mushroom had begun to comfort me. It took my arms, extended my pointer finger, and began poking me in the face and chest while it tried to really, really drive home the point that \x93you are the universe.\x94\r\n \r\nNormally, we either take such a statement for granted or dismiss it entirely. In our world of post-modern reduction, of course I am the universe. My experiences make my subjective reality, and so for all intents and purposes I am the maker of my own universe. But this is not what the entity meant. As it continued to playfully (but mercilessly) poke my face and repeat its mantra, it showed me things I could have never dreamed of seeing and that I will most likely never see again.  I cannot remember what these scenes looked like, probably for the better, but I finally understood how everything is alive, infinitely connected, and incomprehensibly hilarious and beautiful.  And then I realized, everything emanates from everything else. Everything is one, on every scale imaginable, and every single thing is a cocreator in the project of being. It\x92s truly a shame how easy it is to lose sight of these things while in the state of everyday, baseline consciousness. Either way, once I realized these things, my cosmic Watcher and Knower ended its dance and rather unceremoniously revealed itself.\r\n \r\n~T+ 5:00\r\nOnce the veil had dissolved away, I was left staring into eyes filled with terrifying wisdom, love, and emotions I cannot begin to understand or describe. They looked like cuttlefish/octopus eyes, though what I was looking at was definitely not an octopus. I remember a roundish head that was vaguely outlined, but that was about it. In place of things like arms and legs, this being operated solely through pure intent and meaning. It felt neither good nor evil. It simply was, and it was absolute perfection. The blues, greens, and purples of before simply dissolved and gave way to rich, awe-inspiring shades of gold and orange. It was like the most beautiful sunset you have ever seen, only the sun was alive and unmistakably looking back at you. I remember the edges of this being were hidden in darkness, and I could still see the same colors from before leaking out and back into its form. In retrospect, I know that whatever this thing was, it was presenting itself to me in a form that was at the comfortable limit of what I could understand and accept. Still, I could sense there was much more to it. I didn\x92t ask to see more though. I had gotten what I came for.\r\n \r\n~T+ 6:00  \r\nNo words were exchanged any more, because nothing needed to be said. I sat with it and it just hung out with me until our time was up. I have no actual idea of how long this lasted, nor do I really remember when it finally said goodbye and went away. I don\x92t even remember if it ever said goodbye. I\x92m certain it felt no need to, as it hadn\x92t ever really formally said hello either. I have no clue if I will ever see my cosmic buddy again, but I really hope to one day.  \r\n \r\nT+ 6:27\r\nIt was at this time that I remember feeling certain I was back to baseline. My face was really sore from all the poking, and the corners of my blanket and pillow were still wet from saliva. I looked at my phone, made note of the time, and went to get myself something to eat so that I wouldn\x92t feel like death in the morning. I do not remember when I feel asleep anymore, but I thanked my newfound friend and whoever else was willing to listen for the wonderful night and went to bed."
108215,Please Never Take the Pain Away,Anandamide,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis experience tok place in my own home. I was alone, and listening to a Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research playlist on Youtube. \r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nI\x92m a 35-year-old British man, diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in 2014 following a major breakdown and second suicide attempt. I was first diagnosed with depression at 15.\r\n\r\nWhile making good recovery from the sound and fury of my 2014 breakdown, it\x92s given me cause to regather and reconsider my life. I\x92d been curious about the effects of psilocybin on mental health for a few years and in late 2015 decided to give it a go.\r\n\r\nFor the three months prior to this experience, I had been taking small, barely threshold doses of liberty caps 2-3 times a week, interleaved with a slightly higher dose every two weeks or so where I took an evening aside to write and think about any issues and thoughts that had arisen. Dosing in this way has been undoubtedly useful, reconnecting me with an appreciation for life lived in the moment. Although happy in my atheism and comfortable in my rational materialism (for want of a better description), I have started meditating and incorporating forms of spiritual practice into my everyday life.\r\n\r\nThis high dose was an intended culmination of the past three months. This high dose was an intended culmination of the past three months. In order to diminish tolerance effects, the two weeks prior involved no dosing at all. I had intended to step up my meditation practise but if anything it fell away - a brief depressive lull and a new job got in the way. Given this, I considered putting this off until the time was \x91right\x92, but throughout this process I\x92ve found that too much planning is generally misguided - the psychedelics take me where I need to go, not necessarily where I want.\r\n\r\nForeground\r\n\r\nAs I say, I\x92d experienced a brief depressive lull a few weeks back. This resonated with something which had emerged in one of my fortnightly dosing sessions - an underlying sense of grief and sorrow I experience, behind the heartbeat of the world.\r\n\r\nI noted this grief as I emerged from the lull - and while I could intellectually grasp it - grief for life\x92s transience is in the same breath joy for its presence - it still haunted me.\r\n\r\nGoing into this session, I\x92d wondered about exploring these themes - but I feared going too far. I was going to be alone, after all, and this was a higher dose than I\x92d ever taken before. I hoped - more gently and more generally - for some resolution to my knotted neuroses. I already knew, viscerally, that psilocybin loosened up the knotted threads of my psyche somewhat, and I hoped for a continuation of this.\r\n\r\nI was also, however, fearful. I was taking a higher dose than I\x92d ever taken before, I was doing it without a sitter, and although I knew that I would be physically fine I couldn\x92t be certain how my mind would cope. I worried I was being an idiot, wanting too much of a good thing.\r\n\r\nAlso of relevance; just over a year ago a dear friend and lover - Phil - was tragically killed in a traffic accident. Though the grief has faded to the background of the everyday, not a day goes by when I don\x92t think of him. \r\n\r\nHe was a musician.\r\n\r\nHere is my report\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVignette\r\n\r\nI can\x92t have been more than 8, possibly much younger.\r\n\r\nThat day, I\x92d gone walking with my dad. The day was wide and blue and full of sun and spring. We\x92d found a tree swing, I\x92d jumped on it and dad had pushed me and the big blue world swept up around under and over me and I laughed.\r\n\r\nI lay in bed that evening, thinking how much fun I\x92d had, a warm warm glow. Then ice, then an unwelcome chill, as I realised I could never have that day again, never ever. It had gone now, and I could never get it back. Never ever.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe morning after\r\n\r\nI open my mouth, soft; a brief gasp of air escapes, a kiss? A moan? The world catches my breath.\r\n\r\nI open the curtains, pull back the net; Louis Armstrong sings to me, telling me it\x92s a beautiful world.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful world.\r\n\r\nGray skies, rain, wet tiles and wet roads. My breath mists the window as I, as I gasp, near moan, breath dissolves into the moment. It\x92s a beautiful world.\r\n\r\nI have bacon for breakfast.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe night before\r\n\r\nI lay, closed my eyes, felt myself a child, a baby, infinite arms holding me in infinite tenderness, stroking, stroking. The world pulsed, melted, I pulsed, melted, world, I, world, world, melted.\r\n\r\nCelestial, purple erotic, rolling roiling bliss, ecstasy, now now now. It\x92s all\x85 we\x92re all\x85 I\x85 \x85 \x85\r\n\r\nShudder, I can feel it, the music\x92s taking me to remembrance of Phil. Shudder. Shudder.\r\n\r\nQuake.\r\n\r\nHowl. Wordless howl, I feel my body arch my mouth gape, fill the world with pain and anguish and falling forever into black and nothing and nothing even as celestial purple blue, brilliant white light, even as melting, I feel, gape, howl, soundless void of\r\n\r\nI know, I know I whimper. I know, I understand, but it hurts.\r\nI know, I understand, but it hurts\r\nI know, I understand, but it hurts\r\n\r\nQuake, shatter, blossom, melt, it hurts it hurts it hurts\r\n\r\nPlease don\x92t ever take the pain away\r\nPlease don\x92t ever take the pain away\r\nI know I understand but it hurts\r\nPlease don\x92t ever take the pain away\r\n\r\nWaves roil over me, in me, would never take the pain away, could never take the pain away, the agony is ecstasy, without grief love is not, without the soundless void my mouth agape and grimacing there is no bliss, this is bliss, could no more take the pain away than take stillness from dance, or silence from music.\r\n\r\nIt\x92s ok.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nI love you.\r\n\r\nLost, found, like a wave in the ocean. Dissolved, beautifully, blissfully, agonisingly.\r\n\r\nI never realised how many different kinds of love there are, and how they all pulse forth expressed as one, how life feels them all for itself over and over, forever blossoming, forever falling, forever joyful and grieving.\r\n\r\nI love you I love you, I murmur, saying the words as a child to its mother as a mother to her children as a lover to his lover, friend to friend, I love you I love you I murmur, feeling the force of the words the meaning of them, every singe kaleidoscopic syllable and tone of love.\r\n\r\nI love you I love you I love you I murmur, saying it as the world to myself as myself to the world, begging for forgiveness and comforting with infinite love, a lover in passion a throwaway comment to a friend a parting kiss a greeting touch, I love you I love you.\r\n\r\nIt\x92s OK.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWho knows how long that lasted? An infinity, eternity, outside time outside self, the concepts had ceased to hold meaning.\r\n\r\nI felt I was weeping emeralds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt was intense. Too intense for comfort, especially alone. It was intense. Too intense for comfort, especially alone. I pulled myself together on occasion, texted friends, even scrolled through Facebook a bit; trying to make sure I kept touch with the ground, once my ego began to condense.\r\n\r\nStill.\r\n\r\nArgo Part\x92s Cantus in Memoriam Britten struck me, exquisitely beautiful, a haunting paean, suspended once more I wept, it seemed a memorial to Phil, especially as the video was filmed in the Royal Albert hall. Proms.\r\n\r\nI listened to the classical scores and wondered that I\x92d never truly appreciated their intricate beauty before, wondered that anyone ever listened to anything else. I wept, gently. I wept. Emeralds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nImagine, the most intense and mind-blowing sex, fierce and boundless, ravenous, unstoppable. Imagine the fury of it, the soul shattering moment as you cum, as you explode. Imagine that, turned up to the nth degree, infinite, boundless, howling, gasping, wordless, celestial.\r\n\r\nAlone, in bed. Wishing I had someone to hold, holding me. Waves of bliss recede, my\x85 me\x85 my\x85 I\x92m\x85 gasping, still. Post orgasmic chills. But no one to speak with or hold me or kiss, or tell them I love them, I love them I love them, and it\x92s OK.\r\n\r\nI fall asleep eventually. It\x92s OK. I\x92m OK, I\x92m better than OK. I know, I understand, and it hurts. Please never take the pain away.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo.\r\n\r\nI wake. Headache from dehydration, and I\x92ve not slept properly. No worries, those will all resolve themselves.\r\n\r\nI get up, open the curtains, pull back the net. Louis Armstrong sings to me, telling me it\x92s a beautiful world.\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful world."
83609,Cosmically Awful Trainwreck of a Trip,owened,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cigarettes,"\nFor a few months in fall 2007 I was living on a farm in Cornwall (specifically about 5 mi. north of Penzance) as part of the WWOOF program. One Saturday my host took me on a tour of the farm and surrounding hills. At one point she stopped and pointed out some small, brown mushrooms in the grass. \'Those are magic mushrooms, you know,\' she said (they were, specifically, Psilocybe semilanceata). \'I probably shouldn\'t have told you that.\' I laughed it off, but made a mental note: this was obviously too good an opportunity to pass up. I read a bit about dosage on wikipedia, and somehow was left with the impression that 80-100 mushrooms was a normal dose. (I say \'somehow\' because that particular gem is no longer on the wikipedia entry for psilocybin, if indeed it ever was. Friends I\'ve talked with after the fact suggested that this was orders of magnitude more than I should have taken. At the time I just figured that you needed to eat more if they were fresh because they\'re mostly water.) \r\n\r\nThus armed, I went into the fields that evening and gathered exactly 100 of the little guys. I tried to dry them in the oven on a very low setting, but they started to cook anyway and smelled awful, so I took them back out. Before going to bed I ate about twenty of them, just to see if it was something I\'d be able to handle. I didn\'t really feel any differently, but had the extraordinarily vivid image placed in my head of a young girl sitting on the deck of a ship, draped with fishing nets and mouthing something I couldn\'t understand. It was a little disturbing, for sure, but I slept well and woke up the next morning ready for anything.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to hike from the farm to St. Ives (it\'s about an hour or so by bike so I assumed it was a reasonable goal for an entire Sunday). I set out around ten or eleven in the morning, eating half the mushrooms before I left. I ate the rest on the way, a grand total of 80 or so fresh mushrooms. They tasted pretty bad but that earthy, musky fungus taste is one I\'ve acquired, so I didn\'t mind too much. I had reached Zennor about an hour after that when they hit me like a ton of bricks.\r\n\r\nI\'d been yawning a lot, and thinking about what bullshit this psilocybin business was. The yawning wasn\'t connected to any kind of tiredness, but it was compulsive and consistent and it\'s not exactly the kind of magical experience I\'d expect from magic mushrooms. All of a sudden I noticed how interesting the hedges on either side of the road were: the gorse, in particular, was endlessly fascinating. Staring at it, I started to imagine that I was looking down on a miniature conifer forest, and the thought made me smile. I sat down on a rock at the edge of town (calling Zennor a \'town\' is probably being generous: its main street is what we Americans would call the access road of the coast highway, and its area probably totals four or five city blocks) to read for a bit before getting a bite of lunch and heading for St. Ives. I was reading \'The Dice Man\' by Luke Reinhart (highly, highly recommended, btw--among the best books I\'ve ever read), and the reading was a spiritual experience. It was just the synchronicity of being at the right place, at the right time, on the right drug, and it was amazing. I couldn\'t put the book down, and I was grinning and grinning, and smoking like a chimney--each cigarette seemed to be just as enjoyable as the one that preceded it. I finally felt like going into town and eating something, so I put the book away and headed into Zennor.\r\n\r\nThen everything went a bit Pete Tong, if you\'ll pardon the Britishism. Everyone was milling around because church had just let out, and I felt both a bit self-conscious and slightly ashamed to be wandering around a sleepy little town like this in my debauched state. I felt as though I was poisoning the purity of their lives, although on some level I realized that they probably didn\'t even realize I was American--wacked out on psychedelics. I was gawking at a family of ducks wandering up and down the street--this is just not something you see in Texas--when a strange voice caught my ear; a horrible, horrible little voice, scratchy and small and mean-sounding. I listened but couldn\'t comprehend a word of what I heard, and realized that the voice was speaking backwards. At this point the bottom of my stomach pretty much fell out, because there is almost nothing in the world--certainly no sound--as upsetting and disturbing to me as the human voice reversed. It sounded like the voice was coming from my own head, but when I turned around I saw two old women conversing in this odd backwards-speak. (Later, when I was more lucid, I realized that I was probably just misinterpreting their incomprehensibly thick Cornish accent) I decided that I needed to leave. Not just to leave but to go home; I\'d lost all interest in walking to St. Ives. As I left Zennor the clouds rolled in, and everything just kind of deadened.\r\n\r\nThe walk back was maybe two hours, maybe a bit more, but it felt like eternity. I hate hearing about other people\'s drug anecdotes so I won\'t drag it out, but trust me that it was literally the worst I\'ve ever felt in my entire life. These are the highlights:\r\n\r\n- feeling the slightly oppressive weight of a black crown on my head.\r\n- trying to read some more to clear my head and finding that I\'d forgotten how to read.\r\n- noticing that animals no longer seemed to shy away from me; seeing (?) a rabbit hop right up to me and past me. realizing it was because I was dead to the world, and the rabbit felt sorry for me.\r\n- realizing with sober clarity that I was now irreversibly insane, and wondering how I could live the rest of my life in such state.\r\n- realizing too that my entire life had been leading up to this point like a monumentally sick joke at my expense.\r\n- being concerned that if given the means--a knife, for example, or razorblades, both of which were back at the farm--my body would kill itself, even though my mind wasn\'t totally convinced.\r\n- seeing a passing car with a family in it and thinking about flagging them down, telling them \'I\'ve taken some drugs and I\'m freaking out, please help me.\' realizing that i was now too far gone, and that it would do no good. thinking that by entering into their lives I would only inflict my own pain on them.\r\n- being on the verge of tears thinking about how I would ever tell my parents that I\'d become a schizophrenic, and how they would respond. that was the only time I ever came close to crying--the rest of the time, I was in such a dark evil place that tears seemed laughably inappropriate.\r\n- smoking. a LOT--at least for me. like a whole pack of Gauloises, almost. this was the only (sort of) good thing about the whole experience: that smoking never lost any of its pleasure.\r\n\r\nI finally made it home and lay down on my bed. I closed my eyes and just let the black feelings wash over me, and decided I\'d wait until evening to tell my host that I\'d permanently fucked my brain after taking mushrooms. surprisingly, within the hour the awful blackness turned into awful black waves, which themselves washed over me at longer and longer intervals and for shorter and shorter periods. by dinner time I actually felt almost normal, albeit shaken to the core by what had just happened.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, eating 80 mushrooms at once was probably a stupid idea. I\'m still not sure what the correct dose is for fresh mushrooms, but I imagine it\'s a bit lower. For me, this bad trip soured me on any type of hallucinogen--in fact, the first time I took acid, about six months or so later, I was very upset by the extent to which it felt like being on mushrooms. I think in hindsight I can understand: I\'m a very introverted person, and my mushroom trip was horrible to the extent that I felt utterly cut off from the universe around me, as if I was being denied a connection extended to every other creature in Creation. A year later, I was listening to a story on NPR about a music critic who was diagnosed with Asperger\'s late in life: he described a similar experience with acid, which was comforting to me.\r\n\r\nI admit full responsibility for the badness of my trip, while affirming that I will probably never ever take mushrooms (or acid, or salvia, or...) ever again."
66847,Tripping Alone Worked a Treat,SoaV,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nDate of experience: 20 October 2007\r\nAge: 23\r\nPrevious experience: Alcohol, tobacco, magic mushrooms, cannabis (oral/smoked), amphetamines (oral/snorted), MDMA crystals (oral/snorted), ecstasy (oral/snorted), herbal ecstasy, H.B. woodrose, salvia\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago a casual acquaintance indicated to me that when the liberty cap season would come around here in the United Kingdom, he might be able to sort some mushroom brew for me. I had not taken shrooms since about five years back, when I was a teenager living in the Netherlands, and needless to say I was thrilled at the prospect. I have previously taken P. Cubensis (\'Mexicans\') on several occasions, providing me with some of my happiest memories, and C. Cyanescens (\'Hawaiians\'), resulting in one of the most visually chaotic and unpleasant moments of my life.\r\n\r\nI had been told that liberty caps lie somewhere in between Mexicans and Hawaiians strength-wise, and so I was admittedly a little apprehensive with regard to experimenting with these fungi without a sitter or company of any kind.  However, a couple of weeks ago my acquaintance approached me with a 25 centilitre coke bottle filled up to about one-third of newly made liberty cap brew. After being assured that it contained one approximate dose I took it off him, shoved it in my freezer and waited patiently until the weekend before having a go. After some to-ing and fro-ing I finally settled on taking it at seven o\x92clock on the Saturday evening. I had drunk four beers prior to taking the mushrooms, however as they were consumed over the course of six hours, I was no more than somewhat tipsy by the time I drank the brew. \r\n\r\nAt seven o\x92clock sharp, racked with nerves, I fetched the bottle from the fridge where it had been defrosting for a couple of days, studied the rank-looking wisps of dark spore materia swimming about inside the liquid, opened the lid and took a cautious sip. To my great surprise it didn\x92t taste bad at all, mostly like coke, except with a faint aftertaste of mushroom. Immediately I thought that I had been tricked and that it was simply coke mixed with a sprinkle of culinary mushrooms, but I quickly silenced my suspicion, downed the concoction in a few swift swigs and nervously made myself comfortable on the bed, laptop on my lap. \r\n\r\nConsidering that it was so long ago since I had taken shrooms I wasn\x92t at all sure what to expect, however, I was still surprised when noticing a definite change in perception after only 15 minutes \x96 from what I could remember, mushrooms used to take upwards of 45 minutes to hit me. Stumbling into the kitchen to make myself a soothing cup of tea (promptly forgotten about the second the water had boiled), I noticed that all the surfaces in my little flat were bulging and shifting ever so slightly. I was fascinated when a heavy, squeezy sensation overtook my body, especially my arms: I always enjoy the initial \'Ah, so this is what it\x92s like!\' effect drugs have, even if it often makes me feel a little anxious. \r\n\r\nT=0:20-0:30\r\nI had returned to my laptop and was speaking to my friend A \x96 who also expressed surprise at the swift come-up \x96 by the time the effects started to set in properly. They seemed very salvia-like at first in the way that salvia often appears to exercise a sort of force on my typing, seemingly compelling me to write certain things and omit others. I also felt heavy, thirsty and disoriented, again similarly to after taking salvia, and the bizarre sense of not-quite-identifiable familiarity was nearly identical. \r\n\r\nIt was only once I settled down in bed with my laptop (aptly) on my lap that I was truly entrenched in the experience: as I was watching the screen I developed intense tunnel vision, the walls of which were covered in LSD-like psychedelic patterns, swirling and bulging back and forth. As I was typing away to A, describing my experiences, I saw a colourful man-like creature stretching and extending across the wall to my right as though made of rubber, seemingly reaching for something behind me. Soon after this, I sank into a trip where my room morphed into what appeared to be a night guard\x92s hut in an office complex or similar. I also took the chance at this point, as I stumbled to the bathroom, to take a look in the bathroom mirror: my skin was swirling and rearranging but my face, containing two enormous pupils and a smiling mouth, still looked somehow smooth and clear.\r\n\r\nUpon my return from the bathroom I managed with some effort to approach my laptop \x96 now standing on my \'coffee table\' (a tired-looking cardboard box turned on its side) \x96 to type a few lines to A, with whom I had discussed tripping on many an occasion. At this point I was quite mentally disorganised but nevertheless with a big, nervous grin plastered on my face and laughter bubbling inside me. As I was attempting to uphold a conversation, he interrupted me gently by saying, \'Go lie down, relax. :)\', repeated a couple of times by varying vocabulary until it registered with me. I was deeply touched by how \x96 at least as I perceived it \x96 he had perfectly picked up on how I was feeling. After expressing my deep appreciation and adoration for him I switched on the rugby world championship final, South Africa vs. France (something I would never normally watch, as 1. I\x92m not a sports fan, and 2. rugby makes no sense), and lay down in bed. \r\n\r\nT=0:30\r\nAs luck would have it, the South African rugby team was introduced by an African tribal chanting choir, whose harmonious thrumming sounds drew me in in a way that few other types of music could have done at that moment. As the voices washed over me, visions of faces the colour of ebony floated before me and morphed into infinitely long, wide ribbons, intertwining and shimmering from blue to red to purple to yellow.\r\n\r\nI have never taken mushrooms alone before \x96 except for one disastrous occasion during my na\xefve teenage years when I was living at home with mum and dad \x96 but the come-up of this trip went a long way in demonstrating to me why doing so can be a fantastic experience. When I later commented on this to A, he agreed that solitary tripping has a lot of advantages: not only does it eradicate social anxiety, but it allows you to lie down, relax and trip for as long as you want with no immediate interruptions. \r\n\r\nAs I was stretched out in bed listening to the chanting and then the game\x92s introductory talks, a little chilly but wrapped up tight in my blanket, I was awash \r\nwith an incredibly fierce sense of empathy for the world, somehow deeper and more forceful than what I commonly experience on MDMA. Every word that filtered through to me from the rugby commentators, however trivial, rang with a profound veracity that sent shivers down my spine, and it was all I could do to stop myself from running over to the TV and stroking it in fascination. Instead I curled up on my side and allowed the visuals to take over completely. Soon I was covered from top to bottom in flowing bands of living textiles, whose snake-like tongues extended toward me and seemed to investigate my paralysed face. I could feel a faint, faint breeze from the air around me being gently stirred by the textiles\x92 movements. I felt on some level as though I should feel afraid, or at least concerned, but instead I sensed only curiosity from these half-creatures.\r\n\r\nSoon after this my lazy lounging was interrupted by a more insistent CEV: in noteworthy salvia fashion I saw \'myself\' as a dark brown wooden structure, located on a shelf full of identical dark brown structures. The image is unclear now, as it was only a brief flash in the first place, but I instantly picked up that it represented my life and how alone I actually am at the moment. Suddenly it occurred to me with crystal clarity that I don\x92t have any real best friends anymore. This realisation stung me momentarily but did not sully my trip. \'I have chosen to be this alone\', I thought to myself, and it felt good and cleansing to face up unequivocally to my solitary state. \r\n\r\nT=1:00\r\nAfter about half an hour of tripping in bed my eyes flew open, and I was quite startled to discover that my room was not covered in swathes of colourful textiles as I had imagined when my eyes were closed. As soon as I\x92d recovered my bearings slightly, I decided to return to a sitting position to converse with A. I struggled to sit up straight in front of my \'table\' and instead slouched semi-vertically, clinging on to the keyboard, again in a salvia-like, ultra-gravitational fashion. I was easily distracted and often found myself drifting off into a trippy reverie, and consequently it was quite difficult to read the writing on the computer screen and formulate sentences.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still found myself utterly entertained by A\x92s and my stop-start, sporadic conversations. It was quite clear that he has had plenty of experience of sole tripping, and his obvious understanding for my state of mind was very comforting. I was still being assailed by frequent stabs of intense empathy and a sense of deep connection, especially for A but also for the players on TV, the rugby commentators, actors appearing in adverts, objects in my room and everyone/-thing else crossing my mind. I was also suffering from the occasional flicker of social anxiety whilst speaking to A, a few times, as I was about to write something inane and trivial, my \'salvia mind\', as I have come to consider it, broke in and forced me to stop typing for no obvious reason. This led me to sometimes being entirely unable to type anything for a couple of minutes whilst waiting for the writer\x92s block to pass.\r\n\r\nT=1:30\r\nIt was at around 20:30 that I decided to have the first cigarette of the evening. I already had half a one left that I\x92d rolled and smoked from earlier on, but I still found wrapping myself up in a jacket and heading to the window a complete ordeal. Once I was safely ensconced on the window sill, however, I had no regrets. The world outside was bathed in an atmospherically red light, and the night clouds, soft and smooth and nearly covering the black velvet sky, were illuminated in grey and neon orange by the city below. Never have I seen anything so beautiful as those clouds: as I looked on in stunned silence they swirled and morphed sensually from one shape to another, and soon I was in the midst of a trip wherein the lower surface of the clouds consisted of a thin, glowing wall, moving quickly upwards from the horizon and across the sky. Now and then the clouds would shift allowing the white, mysterious face of the moon to peek out solemnly at me. It was sad to consider that once I was sober again, the world would no longer look anything like that. \r\n\r\nT=2:00-3:00\r\nThe night continued further along this general pattern: I spoke to A, smoked a couple of cigarettes (not as many as one might have thought considering the beauty of the outside world, had it been summer and warm I would probably have spent half my night on the windowsill, but mushrooms tend to make me feel chilled to the bone), relaxed in bed, gawked at the absurdly claymation-esque rugby players \x96 who, in fairness, look quite deformed and lumpy at the best of times \x96 and admired the patterns swirling about on the wall. At one point, as I was in the midst of an in-depth introspective look back at my own person, I happened to glance at the front cover of a book standing in my bookshelf. A thin, colourful film of some sort, probably originating from the same visual disturbance that was causing the upwards-moving cloud wall, was streaming up along the wall and across the book cover, causing the letters to bulge and bend in a very 70\x92s-psychedelic-art-emulating fashion. \r\n\r\nAs the rugby game ended at 22:00, A and I spent a few minutes laughing at the expense of the celebratory procedures, involving a crying child, a flimsy-looking brass cup and a man with a swathe of blue cloth seemingly rising up out of the back of his head. At times I was literally weeping with laughter, entirely unable to contain my wheezing giggles (in fact, talking to A about a variety of silly things prompted me to have a wide grin smeared on my face all evening \x96 when I wasn\x92t laughing of course, which I was doing often). And yet I managed at the same time to be moved deep in my soul by how happy everyone was about the rugby victory.\r\n\r\nIn classic mushroom-style, A and I also appeared to level out mentally in a fascinating way, causing us to have a few great-minds-think-alike sort of moments. One in particular stood out from the others as it occurred with such superb timing: as we were discussing the fact that all the Irish and the Welsh were cheering for South Africa \x96 that is, against England \x96 during the rugby game, I wrote very randomly \'the welsh hate the english\', at precisely the same time as A wrote, \'the welsh hate the english?\'. Whilst this would arguably not be accepted as scientific evidence for telepathy, it did rather take me aback, especially as similar incidents kept occurring throughout the evening. A did indeed claim later that he experienced a \'contact high\' effect from merely speaking to me online.\r\n \r\nT=3:00-4:30\r\nBetween three and four hours after dosing I was still tripping, both visually and mentally, but not nearly as intensely as I done earlier. As the rugby game came to an end (congratulations South Africa!) three hours into the trip, I switched over to \x91Stepmom\x92 and settled down for an hour and a half of mindless, American drivel. But, however cheesy and sugary-sweet the film may have been, I was repeatedly deeply impressed with the actors\x92 performances, in particular Julia Roberts\x92 and Susan Sarandon\x92s. I seem to recall that I did not enjoy watching films \x96 or, in fact, sober humans of any description \x96 when I used to take shrooms years ago (one of my only lasting flashbacks, that sometimes appears after smoking weed and even occasionally when drinking, springs from a mushroom trip that caused me to see humans as extremely absurd-looking, even ugly, with protruding noses and greenish-yellow faces), but this time I found it thoroughly enjoyable and not at all disturbing, in spite of finding the people to be quite remarkable in colour and appearance. \r\n\r\nI also continued to chat to A, which remained entertaining as I was beginning to come down. I did however notice a particular visual effect that made reading and writing on the computer a little difficult: when I wasn\x92t focusing intently on the words, they all looked exactly the same bar for their length, inviting to some confusion occasionally when I was idly skimming through what A had written. \r\n\r\nT=4:30+\r\nFrom this point on, I was starting to come down properly. A went out for a while so I was left to my own devices, at which point I settled down to watch a program about the \'scariest moments on television\'. One of these moments, number 50-something I believe, was of The Wicker Man, a 70\x92s horror flick. A clip from the ending of the film \x96 which I shall not reveal for those of you who still intend to watch it \x96 was shown, and the general atmosphere of terror being conveyed was so intense that I felt faint for a few seconds as I watched it. Again, this appeared to be an effect of the intense empathy I was experiencing throughout the evening: it felt as if I truly were the character in peril, and upon feeling what he was feeling my heart squeezed with ice-cold dread. That experience was the last real trip I sank into that evening, it was now 11:30, my energy levels were depleted and I was thrilled at the prospect of laying down for a relaxing night\x92s sleep. The exhaustion I experience after a mushroom trip is surprisingly pleasant, despite \x96 or perhaps because of \x96 how it permeates my bones.\r\n\r\nThe next day I was a little tired and fuzzy, similarly to how I feel with an alcohol hangover. It was only when I walked to the shop to fetch some basic supplies that I realised that I was rather unsteady on my feet. Overall, however, I was in an excellent, proactive mood, feeling like something in my mindset had changed for the better. The feeling of mild physical exhaustion remained for another day, after which it disappeared entirely. \r\n\r\nOverall I am intensely pleased with the outcome of the trip. Hereafter I shall be less anxious about tripping alone on mushrooms, as I find that it is rewarding psychologically in that I could examine some areas of my life that I had not let myself consider closely before, and it also let me appreciate the aesthetic aspect of the trip without any external interruption. Additionally, as A mentioned, social anxiety is eradicated and there is no risk of the confusing, messy situations that easily arise when tripping in a group of three or more people. It may be a testament to A personally, but I in fact found that his online company was easily comparable to that of close friends I have previously tripped with in real life: the same interpersonal empathy and understanding was there, and A was not even tripping himself. \r\n\r\nConclusively, the experience was entirely positive and I am already looking forward to mushrooms being in season again."
42215,The Floyd House,Odie,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThe Floyd House.\r\n\r\nWe had the whole house and night to ourselves. There was a whole house full of people who were on nothing but LSD and/or Mushrooms. Every light was off, Every window was covered. Nothing but Candles flckering vibrantly and the distant screams of peoples souls breaking and minds expanding. Nothing but Pink Floyd played in the house that night.\r\n\r\nIt was about 7:30pm when everyone was after consuming there Phycadellics. I ate about 100 Newfoundland Liberty Caps. Which I believe are one of the most potent shrooms around. We hung around the house chatting and laughing for about30 minutes when untill everyone realized what has kicked in. \r\n\r\nThe Candles were lit. The Lights went off. The Music was turned on.\r\n\r\nI sat as comfortable as I could on the couch in the basement letting my mind flow like a leaf going down a river, thoughts past me by, friends, life, peoples face\'s, I slowly felt a tingle in my legs and a chill go up my spine. The music took ahold of me, many different patterns and colors flowed by my eyes, and around peoples faces. For each different note of music a diffirent color or pattern would be created.\r\n\r\nThen all of a sudden it stopped. A friend tapped me on the shoulder and whisperd to me to wonder if I wanted to go on a short walk through the park that was just down the road. As I walked up stairs, I found it difficult to find my own shoes, some were too big, some were to tight, none looked like mine, every design was different and kept changing. Soon enough I just grabbed any pair that would fit and went on the walk.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing so softly, and the air was perfect. Not cold, nor too warm. We walked through paths, and through trees, Where, I felt as if I was an ant. The Trees grew hundreds of feet tall, and I didn\'t feel superior anymore, A little bit of paranoia maybe? But thats what I love about shrooms. The feeling of awareness.\r\nWe got to a bridge where the water was roaring so loud, so strong, it was so powerfull. It was just the night before were we had a huge rainstorm so of course the river would be rushing like mad. We stood there in amazement from the river, and the salmon jumping up it. As well as the lights from the hospital across the street, peering through the trees that were divinding us from civilization and our own world. \r\n\r\nWe could feel the air the river was pushing shaking the bridge. Every now and again, I would feel a blast of energy go straight through me. I could tell it was just the mushrooms comming on stronger. I wasn\'t even peaking yet, and I could tell it was the most intense trip I was going to have. We smoked a joint and I could tell the joint had a huge affect on my visuals and just the all around feeling through out my body. It hit me so hard I had to go sit down on a bank and brace myself for everything that was just happening, decision making was the hardest, we had everything to go, everywhere to go but we could decide. Everything confused me, it put a fear in my eye which made my mind race so fast.\r\n\r\nAll I could think about was getting back into the Floyd Room. I left the park. My friends decided to stay there and wander abit more, I walked towards my friends house, as there was still alot of people inside tripping out, Im on my way up the street, I can feel it comming on stronger and stronger, it felt as if It(The House) was calling out to me. I was at a part in the street where there is a long chainlink fence next to me, that looked like it stretched for miles.\r\n\r\nI finally reach the house, I get in kick off my shoes, and then I\'m greeted by two people with a plate of shrooms, they ask me to divide it for them, and at this point my mind was in a world of its own, people didn\'t look like people, objects took on images of in releif. I mash my hand in the middle of them and make two sperate piles, which I have no idea are equal or not. I was tripping mad.\r\n\r\nI rush to the basement with a smirk on my face and I crash to the floor besides a couple of my friends. Probably some of the ones I enjoy doing shrooms with the most. We sit, listening to Pink Floyd. I lay down catch my breath and hall out a pack of matches, every now and again someone would light a match or flick a lighter for some affect. I lit acouple and just studied the flame to such a extent, from the scrapping off the flint on the side, to the chemicals reacting to cause a flame to the burnigng, the smoke, the demise of the flame, and nothing left but a chared skinny stick. It amazed me. Made me think of all the things mankind has created and discovered, as well as destroyed and totally ignored/shruged off.\r\n\r\nI lay down on my back staring up into nothing but pure blackness with the strumming of a bass, the whaling of a guitar the screams, and the hums, and the distorted voices, and just The Noise.\r\n\r\nI found the inner peace I knew I\'d need to find that night to survive. I felt as if my mind matured, as if I had a life bar, and I added on an extra stat or two. It was refreshing. I felt I could do anything, as if I was invincible. I pictured myself doing backflips from thehighest objects, me with my girlfriend having the time of our life laughing, spinning, and just being happy.\r\n\r\nI then sat up, rather quickly because I was so amazed at how good I felt, about myself, and everything and everyone around me. I let a match and held it up high then slowly put it towards the ground, moved in closer to examine it, and I just sat, about 1 inch away from the flame watching it play tricks with my mind,  flashing and flickering. The music still flowing around me, making my trip more and more enjoyable and intense. Then, Bang!\r\n\r\nI hear thumping like someone running down stairs as quick as they can, and then someone screaming as loud as they can. Then around the corner comes in one of my good friends with sparklers in his hand running in and out in circles, screaming. He destroyed everything, my reality, my state of mind. But I loved it! It made me laugh, and smile how he was having fun and tripping out just like me. I could hear people breathing in so deeply and letting out like they just seen a ghost or people sometimes screaming once they feel that urge that they can\'t take it anymore.\r\n\r\nI giggle, and play tricks on a friend sitting next to me, I whisper his name, and I see him looking around and then laughing thinking its the shrooms, I do it again a couple of times untill he notices its me. It was pretty fun. Then the song that would be the theme for the whole night in the end. \'Atom Heart Mother\' I explored my mind, my most deepest thoughts, I began to feel as if I wasn\'t me, and we lived life as something completely different than human beings.\r\n\r\nA thought that was passing by me, and that stuck with me for a moment, I felt as if I was a ball of energy, as well as all my friends. I felt this so strongly it felt like it was real, like we went this whole lifetime as nothing but balls of energy and colors. I can\'t exactly explain what I seen, but it was like each ball of energy that was my friend, had their face on it, and that ball of energy was destroyed each and everytime they blinked. I felt life was going quick. Everytime I open my eyes I was reborn to a new source of energy, just rolling through this whole feild of energy. and I blink, and it felt as if it was over.\r\n\r\nUntill, my eyes reopened. I then snaped out of it once, another friend that was in the same room halls out a can of hairspray without anyone knowing, and lights a match, and sprays it into the air creating a Dragon I like to call it.\r\n\r\nThe flame was so bright, It roared like thunder and just made everyones pupils dialate. I noticed this once it happend. It was a moving moment. Each persons Body reaction to this Dragon that flew out of its magical lamp to make you think thats whats not there is, and making the things that are there totally take on the charaistics of anything your mind could or couldn\'t wrap it\'s self around, But in a split second it was gone.\r\n\r\nOnce the playlist was over, and the lights came on, it was only 12:00am It felt as if it should be 4:00am and we should be waiting for the sun to rise. Instead some of us headed upstairs which we watched \'Darkside of the Rainbow\' Where you play Darkside of the moon by Pink Floyd In Sync with The Wizard of Oz. It was so trippy, and the music flowd with the movie so perfectly, it was as if this is the way it was meant to be watched. Once that passed by We put on \'The Wall\' by Pink Floyd as well. All I could think was \'Woah\', The Images created in that film blew my mind. The Dancing Flowers, The unusual creatures and masks, and monsters, that were incorporated in it was perfect. A Movie I would recomend to anyone who is going to take any type of phycadellic.\r\n\r\nWe then, stayed up and watched the Sun Rise, It was beautiful. This was the conclusion to my trip. The most beautiful, mystic, and Inspiring Mushroom trip I or anyone could ask for. Mushrooms are the pathway to the unknown. Wether it be a beautiful emerald green sea, or a devestating black pit of horror. Each trip created by mushrooms is one to remember, Something I could never take for granted such, tiny organisms that can defend themselves to a state to put the creature who is harming them in total chaos and insanity."
48562,Quirky Hallucinations,Holfield,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis report was originally published in 2007 under the author name ""Daedelus"", changed to  ""Holfield"" on July 20 2021. An Addendum was also added July 26 2021.\r\n\r\nI discovered \'magic mushrooms\' when I was living in the UK in 1980. Much earlier, I had tested LSD maybe 10 times, and had a lot of very unpleasant experiences\x85I later realised this was because I was uncertain what I intended doing with my life, and I had parents who expected far too much of me. I was anxious, more than I realised at age 17. I was more interested in  \'reality research\' (using the chemical keys which seem to have been left lying about by a kind, humorous Universal spirit!) than in proving myself academically, and this didn\'t fit their view of what a dutiful eldest son should be doing.\r\n\r\nI was a teenager in the 60\'s, saw Hendrix live at Woburn Abbey on his return from recording Electric Ladyland in the USA, and took some of the original \'Operation Julie\' LSD several times.\r\n\r\nSo, by 1980, I had left LSD 11 years back down the timeline, and had learned a lot about myself and the world. I was no longer an adolescent, under the scrutiny of a high achieving academician father, I had become a lot calmer and more accepting of myself, my strengths and weaknesses, and had also developed a worldview which was essentially humanist, with some eastern mystical and Buddhistic elements. \r\n\r\nAnd, I got on great with girls! Isn\'t libido wonderful! (I\'m sure it helps)\r\n\r\nI had, from age 11, noticed something very interesting about so called reality, which was, more than any other single external factor, to shape my life\x85I had started having what were quite clearly precognitive flashes and dreams.\r\n\r\nIt started when I was 11 and at school outside the UK. It was an all boys boarding school, and the authorities relied heavily on the use of corporal punishment. This was something which seemed often to be prescribed with very little justice, and often with no connection at all with what we might have been doing! So, I noticed, I would have the strong presentiment on say, Tuesday, that I would be going to be caned on the next day!\r\n\r\nI would strenuously try to avoid getting into a situation likely to result in a caning, but on Wednesday evening, while we were all doing homework, the master in charge said \'I\'m going down to the main building, I\'ll be about 10 minutes\'\x85I recall this incident very clearly\x85he came back, and said \'Right, if the people who were responsible for all that noise don\'t own up within 5 minutes, I\'m caning the lot of you!\'\r\n\r\nAnd he did. Although no one had been making any particular noise at all\x85Most amusing\x85this happened 3 or 4 times, and was responsible for making me take notice of something which by normal thinking, isn\'t possible.\r\n\r\nIn later years, I had very clear and increasingly frequent examples of obviously precognitive dreams, which I learned to distinguish from \'ordinary dreams\'; I would always tell someone I had just had a precognitive dream on waking, and they would very often be there to experience the dream events occurring later that day. The events would normally be sufficiently unusual and detailed that it was a clear effect, not coincidence or wishful thinking on my part.\r\n\r\nThis has actually been very useful in my life, and I\'ve been tested with extremely positive results in a well known University Parapsychology lab.\r\n\r\nDon\'t let PSICOP persuade you these effects are not real! They have their own agenda! Instead, read JW Dunne\'s book, \'An Experiment with Time\'.\r\n\r\nThere is even a website on this book now\x85\r\n\r\nAnyway, 1980 was just a year after my Lab Parapsychology experience, and also just after I\'d broken up with a girl I had been living with for 4 years\x85 I was not in the best state emotionally, but feeling much more positive than I had been six months earlier, and dating again!!\r\n\r\nOn this particular summers afternoon, a bunch of us had decided to go into the University city, to see \'Last Tango in Paris\' at a small cinema.\r\n\r\nWe were going in an open car I owned, but as I had for some reason taken these liberty caps, I asked someone else to drive.\r\n\r\nI sat in the passenger seat, with two or three others behind us, and as the steel blue Triumph Vitesse convertible wafted its way from the little village where we all lived in two adjoining cottages, I gazed at the passing scenery, and felt the mushrooms starting to take effect\x85my arm gently waving in languid circles in the balmy, scented summer air\x85fingers combing the ripples of clear, sparkling air\x85what? \'Yes, it\'s clear, perfumed, sparkling and so, so CLEAR\x85look around you\x85!\'\r\n\r\nSomewhere, distant, but somehow also close, I became aware of the drumbeat underlying the superficial surface of visual everyday reality\x85I sensed the enormity of mind in the Universe, the connections, so strongly felt in this condition, but how strange that we have to live our lives as individuals in this competitive, consumer frenzy, when just a handful of mushrooms away is this secret world of beauty, colour and understanding of the way things REALLY are\x85mind, expanding, substance\x85\r\n\r\nThis sudden, mystical contemplative and visionary state was alternating with something like my normal state of mind, with a frequency of maybe five minutes, though it\'s hard for me to be sure of the time lapse after so much time has passed...\r\n\r\nI would find myself \'back in the car\' and be able to smile at my friends and even talk normally\x85then I\'d look at the surroundings and be away again\x85at one point, I saw a roundabout in the road, and as we passed around it, I saw tulips and daffodils at least 15 feet high burst out of the ground, and reach their full, impossible height in less than a second, to hang, heads flopping to a standstill as drops of crystal clear water sprayed off them, sparking in the sunlight\x85then, within seconds, I saw a couple of people, again ridiculously and impossibly large and tall, with huge beaming faces emitting glorious golden light....and I KNEW these were hallucinations, at the time, but I also felt they were a part of a reality which is normally hidden behind the veil of the reduced consciousness which we use to cope in the everyday reality we have created as a species.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the city centre, a beautiful, medieval marketplace amongst ancient and spectacular buildings, and some modern monstrosities.\r\n\r\nOn getting out of the car, I noticed that the sky was filled with firework rockets, though it was daytime, and all the church bells were ringing wildly!! I thought \'Wow\x85first time I\'ve had anything like this! These are hallucinations too!\' But I felt as though I had been specially singled out for this experience.\r\n\r\nThen, we came to the cinema. We had to queue with other people for several minutes, and eventually it was my turn to line up at the little hatch with its glass screen, with an open section at the bottom, and some poor person the other side asking me for my money!\r\n\r\nI creased up, laughing uncontrollably, it seemed so completely ridiculous, why was I doing this? I had lost all desire to see the film anyway, but was also incapable of thinking about money, tickets and the rest\x85and the vision of this poor guy\'s patient, bemused face just cracked me up totally.\r\n\r\nI reeled, hooting with laughter, out of the narrow tunnel-like passage, into a dogleg shaped pedestrian walkway forming a right angle along two sides of a department store, and crashed into the wall of the store opposite, a small boutique type shop.\r\n\r\nThen I heard a voice, from above, which announced loudly, \'You challenged God, and won!\' The voice was full of timbre, not unkind, not Jovian, just, incredibly, THERE!\r\n\r\nGobsmacked into silence, I looked at the people passing by, to see what they had made of this extraordinary announcement, but it seemed no-one had heard a thing!\r\n\r\nI realised this had been \'for my ears only\'. \r\n\r\nI\'ve been wondering what that one was all about ever since!\r\n\r\nI did manage to get in to see the film though I couldn\'t make any sense of it, it seemed like a jumble of disconnected images and I couldn\'t follow any plot. Later, with my friends, we had a few drinks which I think calmed me down a bit, and as the evening finished, we went home with no further quirky hallucinations.\r\n\r\nI decided psilocybin was my \'drug of choice\', but have come to see it as a sacrament, in the sense Aldous Huxley meant in his writing on the subject of mescaline, and SOMA.\r\n\r\nLeary makes a lot of sense on this as well.\r\n\r\nHappy tripping, but remember, folks, SET AND SETTING!\r\n\r\nAnd read John P. Allegro, \'The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross\'\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 2021: Addendum\r\n\r\n40 years after the event, I had come to consider certain other aspects, almost unmentioned at the time, as indicating something rather more interesting. In fact I was fully aware of this \'almost unmentioned aspect\' as the events were unfolding, so maybe in 2005 I left it out due to not wanting to overload the report with superfluous detail. \r\n\r\nWhat I\'d like to add as addendum is the feeling I had at the time and since, that this appearance of fully formed, larger than life technicolour, moving 3-dimensional elements (the 15\' tall stop-motion, timelapse effect flowers, with the truly Hollywoodian Hannah-Barbera ""drops of crystal-clear water flicked off the heads"" as they settled in position) was something totally new in my experience. I was aware of the somewhat \'cartoonish\' aspect of the flower and \'the couple\' visions, but this was all in line with my feeling that ""the Universe has a sense of humour""....specially the \'dimension 5 creative intervention team\'. It was like a knowing wink from The Obverse. I realised this at the time, as it was happening, it was a completely new order of \'hallucination\', far from the usual distortion of the visual reality, the \'entoptic\' showers of symbols and other well known effects found with hallucinogens. \r\n\r\nThe thing that struck me AT THE TIME was that it implied an overall feeling of intelligent oversight. Something had decided to inject this extraordinary visual material totally seamlessly into my consciousness stream in a way that was easily superior to any cinematic special effects team\'s work. It was \'more real than real\'... the colours scintillated a sense that this was generated in, and sent by, some sort of witty little \'editing entity or team of editors\' in a place or dimension that was definitely not this one. I\'d not come across Terence McKenna at the time, but his description of the Salvia divinorum \'dimension\' as being orthogonal to our own 4d reality might have been an appropriate choice of source. Somewhere parallel to our own reality, but more than capable of intervening, for its own mysterious reasons via our minds. A slightly pranky, but friendly and very welcome (and welcoming?) intervention.\r\n\r\nI thought this as the first event, the flowers, unfolded. I now think the appearance of the facial- light emitting giant couple, man on the left woman to the right (his left) was longer after the flowers than I implied, though certainly less than 20 seconds. It was certainly after we had left the \'roundabout\'. The couple were striding in our direction,across open land to our left and the sensation they projected was one of warmth and reassurance. I was aware that I was the only one of us able to see this... and being a realist (!) who had been working in the field of psychiatry for six years felt no urge to mention these visions to my friends, all themselves psychiatric workers.\r\n\r\nI felt highly honoured to have been granted these amusing visuals, so completely unlike \'hallucinations\' I\'d previously experienced with any entheogens, but when we arrived at the medieval Market place in Cambridge to the tumult of a full civic firework display with additional wild church-bell carillon, I realised this was again something totally new in my experience... a full on, surround sound auditory intervention with added visuals, the rockets screaming across the summer sky to their individual terminal explosions.\r\n\r\nThis whole new event was also totally realistic, imbued with a sense of \'revelatory contact\' in a warm, humorously supportive sense, and again I realised nobody with me was aware of anything out of the ordinary. I think none of the others had taken any mushrooms, but as I had been lucky enough to have been offered two giant Kilner jars of dried semilanceata, well compressed into the jars, back in January 1980, I was in the habit by mid-summer of using them quite frequently, often with others. But not, I think, this time....I\'d taken them intending a nice pastoral contemplative excursion alone.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Final\xe9 was the pure voice element as I rebounded off the wall of Joshua Taylor\'s department store building outside the Arts Cinema. I had never had this sort of voice message, audio manifestation at any time, and as it happened, I was convinced other people in the alley must have also heard it, but judging from their lack of reaction I concluded that it was for my ears only. There was no sensation of the voice as anything \'internally generated\' though, it was exactly as though it was a normal voice from a first floor window....or ""the sky""! So....The Mushroom Talked to Me?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the only possible time I ""challenged God"" was a decade earlier <!-- on the full-blown \'Overdose of Richard Kemp LSD\'-->on LSD when I was 17, when I left normal reality astronomical units behind and part of me feels I may well have entered into some sort of communication with a Higher Reality."
32759,It\'s Stuart!,Frying Vee,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIn 1988 my good friend Pete and I had discussed how we wanted to trip, and that autumn  we went out in search of some Liberty Caps in the local park and playing fields. We managed to find about 100 and kept them safe to dry out whilst we waited for a convenient time to take them.\r\n\r\nWe planned it one Saturday night when we had arranged to go out in a group of about ten people with our girlfriends. We had a normal evening drinking beer, but towards the end of the it somebody suggested that we all go on to the local Indian restaurant when the pub closed. Pete and I declined the offer but suggested that the girls go on and enjoy the meal whilst we had our own special meal :).\r\n\r\nAt about 10.50pm I reached into my pocket for the small spice tin which contained 100 dried liberty caps. Neither of us had any trouble eating a handful of the liberty caps each whilst sitting in the pub, despite the earthy flavour and small amounts of grit that I hadn\'t washed off. We washed them down with more beer and waited for about twenty-five minutes, when Pete suggested that it was time to walk back to his house. We said our goodbyes, told the girls to amuse themselves and not to come back too early, and set off.\r\n\r\nThis being my first time, I felt quite scared to walk out into the unknown. I\'d walked the high street many times at this time of night, but I sensed thast this time was going to be different. I felt a mix of anticipation and worry; when would the trip hit me, would I walk into traffic, what if someone started a fight with us, etc. As we got moving, the first half of the journey was just the same as usual, past the burger joints and the taxi rank with the crowds of other young people milling around. We both felt excited and managed to get three-quarters of the way down the high street without saying anything silly to anyone passing the opposite direction. My main relief was getting past the most obvious danger point, a pub with a reputation for random acts of violence. I needn\'t have worried - everything was fine and it was just about this point that things started to get interesting. \r\n\r\nAs I was already buzzing with a mix of anxiety and anticipation, I probably didn\'t realise the waves of euphoria that were hitting me from the shrooms. But I began to notice that the street lights and the ones on the fronts of the shops had taken on a much more vibrant look, and that this ordinary street had started to look like a special place. I felt at one with this environment, but also strangely detached, as if nothing could get to us. Despite the fact that we both displayed silly grins, we made it back to Pete\'s without incident. The trip had started to hit us on our short journey, but we still had enough control to hold back any effects and look as normal as possible. Well, I think so, anyway :)\r\n\r\nPete\'s house is small, about 15 feet from a busy road that adjoins the high street and opposite another busy pub, but once inside we could have been anywhere. Once the door shut we gave each other a wide-eyed smile to remind ourselves that from now on it was just us and that we were in a cocoon where we felt safe. I think the effects of the beer helped us to relax and enjoy the mushrooms taking over our minds, which happened pretty quickly once we were inside his house and would have been about 35-40 minutes after we\'d eaten the shrooms.\r\n\r\nWithin a few minutes we had abandoned all sense of ego and were both aimlessly running around his front room doing nothing much apart from enjoying the speed at which everything seemed to be moving. Standing, sitting, walking, picking up objects, moving from one side of the room to another were all to be enjoyed afresh in the state we were in. I had rushes of brilliant insight - thoughts, images, sensations, surged through my brain at what appeared to be lightning speed and with astonishing clarity. At this point I retracted into my own trip but joined Pete again when he managed to get it together to put some music on.\r\n\r\nI was stopped in my tracks, astonished at how clear and three-dimensional the sound was. We both play in bands and I mix and produce music, but the clarity of this music was better than anything else I had ever heard. I wanted to dissect every beat and note that I heard that evening. We gave that particular song (something by The Psychedelic Furs, iirc) at least ten or twenty plays before we got bored and decided to do something else.\r\n\r\nPete decided to try the television and switched it on. It was more difficult to deal with an audio/visual feast because of the concentration required, but we both managed and sat open-mouthed watching simple things like adverts and trailers. The adverts became works of art, every different picture was worth looking at but disappeared too quickly for us to enjoy them. Pete became very interested in a trailer which was played out every fifteen minutes for re-runs of \'The Prisoner\' with its \'I am not a number, I am a free man\' tagline and the brass music that goes with it.\r\n\r\nOnce he had pointed this out we both became fascinated by it. The trailer showed Patrick MacGoohan driving down the sands at Portmeirion in a Lotus Seven being chased by a large inflatable ball which seemed on one hand as absurd as it does in real life, but on another slightly worrying. It was almost as if being chased by a big ball was a real possibility, but unlikely to happen to either of us and therefore worth laughing at. This was great - we had apparently managed to keep a sense of logic in our trips whilst enjoying the positive side. The Prisoner trailer is still the most vivid recollection of this trip - whenever the music started we both started yelling, laughing, and pointing at the TV in anticipation of the car and ball scene!\r\n\r\nOur fascination with the TV may have lasted about an hour, but was eventually interrupted by a shrill noise which made us look up. It seemed alien to us, and we tried to work out where it was coming from. After what must have been about 30 seconds we both realised that the noise was Pete\'s telephone. He somehow remembered how to work it and beckoned me to be quiet, as I must have been making a lot of noise in response to the invasive noise. He picked up the handset, put it to his ear, looked intently at the phone and then at me and told me it was Stuart, one of the party who had gone for a meal.\r\n\r\nPete seemed quite amazed at how this device contained Stuart\'s voice, and called me over to have a go. I distinctly remember hearing the voice and screaming \'It\'s Stuart\' and then bursting into hysterical laughter at the power of this device, which also switched Pete out of his serious state and made him start laughing again. This was the point when I realised that other people existed and brought me partly back to reality. Since we\'d been in Pete\'s house it had been just me and Pete as two halves of one very trippy person. This must have been two hours into the trip, and Pete managed to negotiate the delay of the return of our girlfriends with Stu, who in turn must have realised that we were in no state to have company yet!\r\n\r\nWhen the girls returned, I was still quite euphoric and the next challenge was to get me home in a taxi. This turned up, my gf got in, and somehow so did I. I remember having been told to \'act normally\', and I tried, but the sensory feast didn\'t really help. As we slid along the high street, the lights that I\'d seen earlier were dancing and shimmering, with tracers and all sorts of sparkly effects. and I felt I had to point them out to my unimpressed gf. This must have been about 1.30am - two and a half hours after we\'d eaten the shrooms.\r\n\r\nWe eventually got indoors and I was still enjoying the trip. In fact, the best part of it was during this phase when I was on my own. She went to bed but I stayed up to enjoy as much as I could of the remainder of the trip. At this point I was aware how late it was and that I had to be quiet. I did lots of things to amuse myself. Again the television featured and I found a late-night programme where the presenter appeared to me to be a chicken. He was annoying me by sitting and talking when I wanted music and a visual feast.\r\n\r\nI remember writing a diatribe about this \'chickeny man, peck peck peck\' in a diary I kept for writing song lyrics. I then went to the bathroom, where I found lots of little colourful bottles of shampoo, cleanser, conditioner and lined them all up on the bathroom scales which amused me greatly. My next stop was the spare room, where my keyboard setup was ready for use. I got it together to put on a pair of headphones, patch up a sound and start the sequencer recording. The simple string pad of the Roland MT32 was so lush and interesting to my ears that I played a dischord (two notes next to each other) for about two minutes and listened to the way that the notes beat against each other.\r\n\r\nAs I held this note, I shut my eyes and had visualisations of stripes of blues and reds in wave-like formations, each with a row of little balls slowly moving along from right to left. The balls alternated with various words, none of which I can recall. When this became too heady, I opened my eyes to find my hand resting on random groups of keys, which gave me more interesting and dischordant notes. These sounded so organic that I felt I was inside the music. As a musician I would usually avoid dischords, but these didn\'t bother me, even though I was holding down five consecutive keys.\r\n\r\nFinally, I attached a microphone to the sampler and said the word \'mushrooms\' into it. I now plugged my headphones into the sampler and listened back to the word being repeated at different pitches, both singly and in unison. This had me giggling quietly to myself. I was sufficiently in touch with reality to save the sequenced material to disk and record the whole \'symphony\' to tape the next day, when it didn\'t sound nearly as good. I still have the tape to remind me of the trip!\r\n\r\nI went to bed and must have fallen asleep instantly. When I awoke in the morning I had memories of the extraordinary events of last night in my head. My gf found the \'train\' of bottles in the bathroom and thought it was funny, and then I remembered that I had to go and pick up the car, which I\'d left in the town the night before. I went out at about 9am, and being Sunday everywhere was quiet. I remember thinking \'is this all real?\' as there were still slight visual effects from the mushrooms making things seem slightly sparkly and different.\r\n\r\nI was asked the time by a woman and found it difficult to remember what I had to do to answer her (look at my watch, tell her the time). I wanted to tell everyone \'this is all fake\' and to \'examine the real world behind it\' but there wasn\'t anyone to tell, and my reserve had slid back up again to prevent me from doing do. Once I\'d walked the three miles to the town I felt sufficiently back to reality to get in the car and drive home.\r\n\r\nThis may all have happened a long time ago, but most of it is still very clear and was a positive mind-changing experience for me. It showed me that there were possibly other ways to view the world around us, and I\'ve found that very useful when things have been getting me down. I haven\'t been in the position to repeat the experience with the same conditions since then, but Pete and I have recently discussed doing it again now that we\'re older and our children aren\'t of an age that would make it difficult to find the time to do it. Pete had done mushrooms before this, but never had a trip as good as this one and it\'s possible that the environmental factors (safe place, trusted friend) made this one so good."
28212,UTTERLY Contrary to My Expectations!,I aRe,Amphetamines & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis all started because I was into taking LSD at the time, but often had too hard a time of it in the situations I got myself into (too busy, too social) \x96 the \x91mind-fuck\x92 (MF) would be too much for me, although my friends had no such trouble.\r\n\r\nI found that if I took \xbc - \xbd a g of amphetamine sulphate powder (insufflated usually, but orally also worked) before or at the same time I dropped the blotter, the LSD would have a much reduced visuals (not really what I was after, but what the heck) and MF effect, while maintaining the body-high and physical/mental/emotional/creative energy (the visuals would come on nicely, but much later and usually after a few bowls). The speed seemed to help keep my head clear, unless I did too much/it was too good, in which case the LSD would have zero noticeable effect until the speed started to wear off (~4 hours or so!), but I would still not experience what would be quite a traumatic \x91psychic\x92 experience normally, the MF. \r\n\r\nAfter experimenting with mushrooms for a while, I decided to try a mushroom/speed combination, for much the same reason \x96 I figured the effects would be somewhat similar. I could not have been more wrong\x85\x85..\r\n\r\nWe (collection of psychonaut miscreant youths) were at a friend\'s flat one evening, and with me I had several gel caps, into which I\x92d packed a speed and shrooms \x91blend\x92. I distributed these amongst the willing, to the tune of  \xbd g speed + 30 Ps. Semilanceata shrooms each. We ingested, and as soon as we started to feel a \x91buzz\x92, we set off walking to the local woods, our favourite haunt for such occasions.\r\n\r\nWe were there within a half hour, and we were pretty damned gone by then, but the mood was a good one. Soon we were in the thick of the woods, and by this point, I could not tell, nor did I care, what state anyone else was in \x96 I was in a mad psychic trauma. The visual distortions to the world around me were beyond the pale \x96 everything was exploding with masses of colour, multiple jelly-image outlines around everyone and everything. It was fairly dark, but I was squinting against the brightness of what I was seeing \x96 people would walk around a corner in front of me, yet I could still see them, they were throwing off bright, richly multi-coloured \x91skins\x92 that were left hanging there in the ethers, leaving behind a human shaped weaving tube of colourful brilliance. Not a bit like \x91traces\x92 or anything similar, rather more real, substantial, and un-diminishing. Where one person walked through these, they would leave their own layered atop the previous one(s). I could walk through them, turn, and still see them there behind me with my own added to the crazy mix. As I was walking at the back of a group of around 9, I could hardly see a damned thing of the trees or trail around me anymore.\r\n\r\nThe physical sensations in my body were overwhelming, rush after rush, \x91cutting\x92 zinging tingles of razor sharp nervous sensation, thrummings through the bones \x96 more than I can describe. I could not process thought and such in the least \x96 people would speak to me, I could hear every word, knew the words\' meanings, but could not formulate even the pre-cursors to an answer. If brain cells are moving parts, then mine were glued-fast together. The only thing I could \x91process\x92 at all, was an extremely nervous, very tense and intense, anxiety. I was frozen, closed, locked in and locked up. My head was burning beneath the skull with the overloading pressure of it all. If there was anything more to this experience, anything deeper, any opening doors, connections to the universe etc. then I was far too distraught to notice it.\r\n\r\nMy memory now of some of this is a little vague, but I believe I just started to come down some 5 hours after ingestion with the peak at about +2.5 hours, however, I was still having crazy visuals and psychic problems at +10 hours or so.\r\n\r\nThe others who had taken the caps were similarly effected as far as sensation and vision are concerned, although they generally suffered little \x91trauma\x92, with one exception; One of the guys with us disappeared at one point, and when we backtracked (a half hour of backtracking = he was missing for an ~hour - I was completely oblivious at this time and apparently acted totally passively to the group\x92s activities) we found him up a tree, clinging desperately to a low bough. He would not comedown and just screamed \x91I can\x92t fucking take this shit! Man, what?!?!? Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck!!!!!!!\x92  (paraphrased) and such like, over and over. I don\x92t know how, but they got him down eventually, and coddled him back to some semblance of sanity. Maybe if I could have reached out, verbalised my experience a little, they may have been able to fix me some too \x96 they just thought I\x92d completely spaced-out and left me alone.\r\n\r\nI have taken this mixture since, albeit much lower doses, and had no real trouble at all. One time (the best? Could well be!), I insufflated ~\xbc g speed before eating a mere 8 dried Ps. Semi, and had a most wonderful night -I danced like I was possessed by the spirit of music and dance itself, I felt the ethers contained all motions, and I was just \x91clicking\x92 into them, it was like tai-chi/kung-fu or somesuch, and I was completely \x91in-tune\x92 with the energies and the people I was dancing with. My sense of balance and motion were incredible, as were the feelings of love for life itself. I was utterly ecstatic for ~4 hours. :-)\r\n\r\nI see this as a potentially useful combination, but I\x92d stress to anyone considering trying it, beware the dose! Unless that is, you like to hurt yourself psycho-emotionally. \r\n\r\nI wonder about the psychopharmacology of this mixture.\r\n\r\nTake care, and happy, safe exploring (inploring?!?) to all! :-)\r\n\r\nI aRe - \'There _is_ more than *this*!\'"
27554,Touched by the Goddess,Flo,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nWhat I write below is an account of the most profound experience of my adult life. I must stress that previous to this experience before hand I have never been religious, have no history of mental trauma and was/am devotee of classical darwinian theory. This was my first experience with a potent entheogen. \r\n\r\nAfter working abroad for the best part of a year in the Tropics I had returned home to my \'home\' greatly changed. This world I had grown up in now seemed cold, materialistic and spiritually dead. I had always been interested in altered states and had (through my rainforest experiences) become much more acutely aware of aboriginal beliefs and how much more spritual they were. Furthermore my interests in ethnobotany had become ignited and blended wonderfully with my interests in ecology and conservation. \r\n\r\nAfter reading several books concerning entheogenic plants over a period of 12 months I had seriously began to think about delving into the world of the entheogenic reality personally. The group I had found most intriguing were the tryptamine hallucinogens, primarily because of the profound effects reported by users the deep spiritual beliefs they had triggered throughout human history and their relatively low toxicity. \r\n\r\nConsider my amazement whilst out walking on a sunny autumn day to stumble upon clutches of beautiful Psilocybes, which I promptly picked approx 70 of. After discusion with my ever supportive wife a good friend and I decided that the following evening we (my friend and I) would wrap up warm ingest the mushrooms and take a nightime Hike along a local, familiar countryside route. I spent the day leading up to the journey relaxing and clearing my mind yet a feeling of absolute excitement hung over me. \r\n\r\nThe evening soon came and as soon as darkness fell my friend and I drove up into the hills parked the car (where we could walk home) and ingested 35 mushrooms (each) on a virtually empty stomach and washed them down with ginger ale. the night was cool still and crystal clear with zero light pollution. Approx 15 mins after ingestion (on an empty stomach) I began to feel a creeping uneasiness and slight gastric discomfort and for a fleeting moment some anxiety that I may have poisoned myself. After approx 45 minutes we sat down in a clear spot on the side of steep grassy hill and as we sat down we both felt what can only be described as a jolt of information or a shard of knowledge making us both jump and laugh nervously. Immediately following this my body began to buzz gently all over and the discomfort turned to a euphoria. All around me an overlay of geometric shapes appeared, translucent yet brightly colored. they ran over every surface closely mapping the contours. In this geometric grid were faint rapidly changing symbols kind of like hyroglyphics and blinking wide eyes. \r\n\r\nDespite the surrealness of this new landscape everything seemed peaceful and my excitement had changed to a more relaxed and euphoric sense of wellbeing. We decided to climb the hill to it\'s summit and lie under the stars for a while as we were both feeling physically \'drunk \'and a little uncoordinated. By time we reached the summit (approx t+ 60mins)we could do nothing but lie down using our back packs as pillows and gaze into the sky. The geometric grid had subsided at this point and the sky had become the most beautiful spectacle I have ever seen. The stars appeared as they truly are in full 3-d perspective hanging below each other like cosmic chandeliers and I began to pick out the constellations I recognized with fantastic ease. Despite the physical inebriation my mind felt clear and switched on. \r\n\r\nI closed my eyes only to see more stars there, so real I reached my hand out to touch them. These were beautiful deep space constellations I have never seen before... a Crocodile, a mushroom shaped galaxy and a rotating lotus leaf. I was in absolute ecstasy and now utter awe, simple melody free rythmic music (somwhat like tribal techno) pumped in head. Time meant nothing. I felt my spirit rise and energy flow from my fingertips into the cold grass until I felt pinned to the earth. Energy now flowed from my head out into the ground also and I felt integral with the earth. It felt perfect and yet so powerful I opened my eyes. Above in the stars formed the rotating lotus with a bright deeply concave centre where the brightest star sat. To my utter surprise my friend gasped\' Can you see that!!\' he said...we both stood and remained transfixed on this huge slowly rotating constellation. \'Is it the centre of the universe?\' he asked somewhat shakily \' Yes I think so... \' was my reply. \r\n\r\nAs these last words left my mouth we were both blasted by something from the centre of this lotus that made us jump into the air and grab hold of one another the feeling was so sudden and intense. It felt like I had just been uploaded with divine knowledge!! A feeling of immense ecstasy overwhelmed us both and we fell to the ground gasping and laughing intensely. This feeling was so profound we decided we must walk home quickly to try and assimilate what had just happened. We walked rapidly down the hill. At the bottom of the hill we passed a small overgrown wood and my companion expressed some fear at its darkness and suggested we hurry past. I gently encouraged him to stand for a minute and look into it. The forest was breathing pulsating slowly, a primordial sound of frogs and crickets echoed throughout the air. The dark greys blacks and blues made way for deep greens and golds and the air warmed up. It felt tropical and primitive... like an earth before /without/after man. Its intensity was overwhelming I tried to step back but my feet felt bound to the earth and instead nearly fell forward. It was though the earth wanted me to watch.. \r\n\r\nI regained my balance and again my friend asked if I could see \'it\'. I replied I could for I knew exactly what he meant. Each tree had begun to emit a bright yellow aura. I looked down at my hand and it too was emitting this visible energy. The light from my hand fused with the tree lights creating a aura that encompassed both me and the trees. I gasped and looked at my friend who had his hand outstretched toward the forest with the same aura emitted from his body and again connected to the forest. \'what is happening?\' he asked with a little anxiety\' Words failed me.. I looked at my friend in the eye and saw the aura intensify on his forehead \' Your forehead is glowing he told me!! \' We both felt an amazing unspoken bond and looked back into the forest. A warm strong gust of wind blew through the forest at us which bathed me in a sense of well being. \r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt a confusing and overwhelming mixture of love and sorrow for the world the wind blew again stronger. \'It\'s alright the wind seemed to say\', but you must wake up... love is the way of the universe\x85love for all and everything.. It is time to new\x85to make peace.. this is the true nature of nature... I felt small compared to this other,  unified and above nothing in the universe, ego-less and humbled, just part of it yet unconditionally loved by it. \r\n\r\nThe aura and sound subsided and we left immediately stumbling down the hill towrds home. We spoke little maybe too confused too approach the subject of what had just happened. My friend tried to utter a few words but stuttered only. I felt an immense sadness that when we need them most our limited vocabulary of words fails us. \' It\'s alright I said.. \x91\x91 That\'s what she told me He said !! From the moment on I never once doubted the credibility of the events of that evening. We were both touched by something divine.. Mother Universe I call it the goddess he called it....I fell into deep contented sleep on returning home. \r\n\r\nFor 3 days I felt ecstatic cleansed changed, positive and full of hope and boundless love for nature and all humanity. The experience has positively changed my worldview and my approach to dealing with and helping people and investigating natural systems. I can only describe what happened as a deeply religious experience\x85where nature is god and the universe the church. It was though I was finally awakened, that the mushroom finally brought me together whole and spirited. \r\n\r\nFor a first time experience I feel blessed to have felt this power of nature, this oneness and wholeness with the earth I have always loved. For this I thank the sacred mushroom."
10413,The Thin Tissue of Reality,Imp,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, Hash & Salvia divinorum","\nDosage\r\nLiberty Caps (dried) - 1.4 grammes - oral.\r\nUnknown species of mushroom (dried) - 1.7 grammes - oral.\r\nHashish - ~3 grammes - Smoked in water pipe.\r\nSalvia Divinorum 5X extract - 1/4 gramme - Smoked in water pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSet and Mindset:\r\nBoth participants were elated having just moved into a new apartment. Most rooms had little furniture and all breakables and electrical equipment had been moved to the corners for safety. (We knew that Salvia can cause people to stand up and wander around so sought to prevent anyone falling face-first into a television set). We decided to take the mushrooms together but again for safety decided to take turns with the Salvia to prevent mishaps. Always better to be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nThis has been a strange day.\r\nAt around 12:00 My friend Tane and I chewed and swallowed 1.4 grammes of Liberty Caps each which we had bought along with a 1/2 gramme vial of 5x Salvia Divinorum extract from a local smart shop. We waited for what we think was an hour but felt no effects beyond a mild giggly euphoria. Tane took a large hit of hash from the bong and that seemed to trigger the mushrooms for him. Tane slipped into the trip and seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. \r\n\r\nFor me, the trip was about to get a lot more peculiar.\r\nThe world began to seem brighter and colours became much more pronounced, as if someone had turned the contrast on my eyes to maximum. Apart from this common effect, I experienced no other visuals and so decided to consume the other mushrooms. Three days ago I took 15 grammes of Cubensis mushrooms which had produced extreme euphoria and strong visuals and yesterday I took another 15 grammes along with 3 grammes of Morning Glory seeds which produced a soporific and introspective trip with only very mild visual effects. I deduced from this that my lack of visual effects was due to a tolerance to the mushroom. \r\n\r\nAfter another half an hour I felt soporific and was unaware just how much my perception of reality had been altered. I wandered through to the living room and accepted all the strange colours as being perfectly normal. I eventually completely forgot I had taken any substances as I slipped deeper and deeper into a dream-like state all the time accepting that all of it was completely normal.\r\n\r\nThen I had a revelation...\r\n\r\nI suddenly realised that this reality was not the one I usually inhabited and I had no idea how the hell I had got here. I was experiencing no other visuals apart from vibrant colours but my mind was definately working in mysterious ways. I looked at everyday objects and although they looked normal they were somehow different and alien. This feeling that everything was different was extremely intense and I truly believed I had somehow changed to a different reality. I sat for what seemed like hours just marvelling at this new place and what I had done. At one point the thought crossed my mind that I could not trust my senses to tell me where my physical body really was; Was I lying in bed dreaming all of this? Or even worse was I lying in the middle of a  road somewhere? I no longer trusted anything I saw, heard or felt. I tried to explain all of this to Tane but eventually decided he probably wasn\'t there anyway and I was wasting my (imaginary?) breath. Gradually the effects subsided and I returned to a relatively normal state.\r\n\r\nFor the next few hours I smoked marijuana and tried to make sense of what had happened. I thought that nothing could match this experience for sheer unsettling weirdness but there was much, much more to come.\r\n\r\nI emptied out the vial of Salvia and divided the crushed extract into two 1/4 gramme doses with the aid of a set of scales. I emptied the material into the water pipe and Tane took a lungfull, held it and laid back. After several minutes he said he felt nothing at all so I gingerly poured my dose into the bong expecting nothing but a sore throat from the smoke. How absolutely mind-buggeringly wrong that assumption was still makes me giggle at the naivete of it. I took a large and hard drag of the pipe and held the smoke for approximately 30 seconds then exhaled. I laid down on the ground but felt nothing so after perhaps another 30 seconds I sat up and finished the bong and again laid down. Suddenly I was again not in my normal reality, but if the mushrooms were intense then this was EXTREME. \r\n\r\nFirst my vision altered so that everything became geometric shapes of flat colour. A plate I was looking at became a perfect blue circle against the pale blue floor and all sense of perspective became meaningless. It was as if someone had taken a photograph, slapped bright paint over everything to remove all shading, lighting and perspective then glued it directly to my eyeballs.  I was completely unable to comprehend what I was seeing and I think I let out a low moan and gasped \'Oh fuck\'. Only a few seconds had passed since lying down for the second time but already things had changed far beyond my ability to comprehend them. The world disappeared and became pure flat whiteness and a giant wheel appeared before me. The wheel was orientated so that it\'s edge was facing me and it rotated vertically. Along the edge were large boxes. Some were filled with things which I can now no longer remember and others were empty. I knew that at one time I had a physical form but wherever it was it certainly wasn\'t here. I remembered that Tane was somewhere near me and I attempted to raise a \'hand\' in the hope he would see me and realise I had lost the plot. \r\n\r\nOne of the boxes now contained my hand and I saw it in its box go round and around the wheel along with all the other stuff. By now I was in a panic but quite unable to do anything about it. I shouted out for help and then saw that my voice was now in one of the boxes (I have no idea how to explain how I could see my voice but I could). I heard my shout for help repeated as it went round and around the wheel in its box. I was deathly afraid that if I tried to move or speak in this place then each part would end up in these boxes and I would be left in oblivion so I stopped trying to speak or move. The volume of the shout would increase and decrease as it got further and closer on its journey around the wheel and every time it was at its furthest away point I hoped and wished with all my soul that it was close enough to Tane for him to hear it and that he could somehow rescue me from wherever the hell I was. I was sure that everything that was me was being disassembled and if I didn\'t do something about this very quickly I would spend eternity trapped in all these boxes spinning endlessly. \r\n\r\nVery suddenly the vision stopped and I sat up however I was still far from normality. I was still experiencing the flat, bright colours, geometrical alteration of shapes and complete lack of depth-cues and perspective. I searched desperately amongst these meaningless shapes for something that could concievably be Tane. I saw some of the shapes move and assumed that was him. I held out my arms to either side of the slowly moving pink shape I assumed was his face as if making a boundary to keep the face shape in my attention. I was worried that if I looked away for even a split second I would never find it again and would be lost in this realm of insanity forever. I said something along the lines of  \'If that\'s you then for God\'s sake do NOT fucking move.\' I asked him if the two flat blocks of colour at either side of my vision were my arms and the strange pink shape above the black and white rectangles was his face. He replied that I was correct and asked me what happened. I could only stare at him as my vision slowly returned to a more comprehensible state. I moved to the other side of the room and sat next to a radiator to smoke a cigarette and try and get warm.\r\n\r\nIt was now about 3 - 5 minutes since I had smoked the Salvia and I thought I had returned to normality. As I sat and smoked, an extremely strong feeling of pulling, melting and twisting overcame my body. I laid back with a groan and felt myself melt and become part of the radiator and floor. This feeling lasted for about a minute and with it returned the transformation of everything into 2 dimensions except this time the shapes bled into each other. I was not panicky this time and I knew the sensation, however extreme, was chemically induced and would pass swiftly. Pass it did and I was soon back to the real world albeit drowsy and very confused. \r\n\r\nMy eyes and mind had been opened wider than I had ever thought possible but it was too much, too fast. It was as if I had taken the mushrooms and salvia for granted and tried to use them as toys, but they had taken me by the scruff of the neck in turn and shown me that all the concepts of reality I take for granted are flimsy things and should they wish it they could toy with me and fracture my mind on a whim. I have a new-found respect for the Sacred Mushrooms and Divine Mint and have been made shockingly aware that the thin tissue of reality is just a matter of perception and that perception is a very, very, subjective thing."
27373,Zeitlose Schw\xe4rze und ewiger Schmerz,Jason,Huasca Combo (Syrian Rue & DMT) & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nErfahrungsbericht mit\r\n3g Peganum Harmala + 1g Psilocybe semilanceata + 150-180mg DMT\r\n\r\nAm 11.10.2003 um 1530 nahm ich die letzte Nahrung vor dem Trip zu mir (K\xe4sepizza). Ich wartete 2,5 Stunden damit der Magen m\xf6glichst leer war und die psychoaktiven Substanzen m\xf6glichst schnell mit hoher Konzentration in den Blutkreislauf und damit in das Gehirn \xfcbergehen w\xfcrden. Um 1800 Uhr nahm ich 4g gemahlene Peganum Harmala Samen zu mir die schon etwas \xfcber ein Jahr alt waren. Deshalb f\xfcrchtete ich dass die MAO-Hemmer bereits abgebaut worden sein k\xf6nnten, aber da sie noch extrem bitter schmeckten (scheu\xdflich) war ich mir sicher dass sie noch eine ausreichend hohe Konzentration an \xdf-Carbolinen besa\xdfen. Ich wu\xdfte dass man keinen K\xe4se (und Alkohol und Fisch usw.) zu sich nehmen sollte wenn man MAO-Hemmer konsumierte, aber die K\xe4semenge der Pizza war nicht allzu hoch und bereits 2,5 h her.\r\n\r\nIch pulverisierte die Samen mit einem Mixer, vermischte das Pulver mit Milch und reichlich (!) Kakao und erhitzte es solange in der Mikrowelle bis sich fast alles gel\xf6st hatte (ich wollte noch Honig hinzugeben, aber der war alle). Du kannst so viel Kakao hinzugeben wie du willst, der ekelhaft bittere brechreizerzeugende Geschmack bleibt. Also schl\xfcckchenweise (mit Nase zuhalten) runter damit und kurz verschnaufen. Ich wollte die verbliebenen K\xf6rner (es wurden nicht 100% alle zermahlen) in meinem Mund mit Orangensaft runtersp\xfclen, aber der Geschmack des Saftes hatte sich ver\xe4ndert (bzw. das Empfinden meiner Zunge) und er schmeckte ebenfalls erb\xe4rmlich. Als ich mich schlie\xdflich dem Bodensatz - der besonders ekelhaft schmeckte - n\xe4herte, wurde der Brechreiz so stark dass ich den Rest nicht mehr trinken konnte und ihn verwarf. Deshalb habe ich in der \xdcberschrift 3 Gramm angegeben, wobei der Bodensatz durch st\xe4ndiges Umr\xfchren nur gering war (es war wahrscheinlich eine Menge zwischen 3 und 4 Gramm, die ich effektiv zu mir nahm).\r\n\r\nIch wartete 25 Minuten damit das Harmalin, Harman und Harmin das Enzym MAO hemmen konnten. Mein Magen f\xfchlte sich nicht besonders gut an, aber es war ertr\xe4glich. Ich wog mir 150 - 180 mg (die Federwaage ging nicht genauer) kristallines DMT ab (Reinheitsgrad ~ 90-95 %, r\xf6tliche Kristalle, die leicht zu einem schmierigen Gel verflossen (DMT hat ja einen niedrigen Schmzpkt)). Ich dr\xfcckte die Kristalle in eine Gelatinekapsel und warf sie um 1825 Uhr ein. Da ich wei\xdf, wie stark DMT wirken kann, wartete ich mit der Einnahme der Pilze, auch da es mir lieber war wenn ich die Effekte eindeutig auf eine Substanz zur\xfcckf\xfchren konnte um sie zu charakterisieren. Ich h\xe4tte das DMT auch rauchen k\xf6nnen, da f\xe4llt die Dosierung leichter, aber ich hatte keine Pfeife, ich hatte keine Lust auf den Plastikgeschmack und au\xdferdem h\xe4tte das Haus danach gestunken, denn drau\xdfen waren die Nachbarn.\r\n\r\nIch wartete bis 1900 Uhr, bis dahin waren keine Effekte zu versp\xfcren und ich f\xfcrchtete, da\xdf sich das DMT bereits zersetzt hatte (Alter ~ 1 Jahr, Lagerung: k\xfchl und dunkel in einer verschlossenen Glasflasche). Deshalb nahm ich dann 1 Gramm Psilo. semilanceata zu mir, da meine Eltern nicht da waren und ich diese seltene Gelegenheit nicht ungenutzt verstreichen lassen wollte und da ich nicht noch l\xe4nger warten wollte, weil dann irgendwann die MAO-Enzyme ihre Aktivit\xe4t wieder erlangt h\xe4tten und ich das ekelhafte Gebr\xe4u somit umsonst getrunken h\xe4tte. Also rein mit den Pilzen, sch\xf6n durchgekaut und runter. Bei Pilzen geht es immer ganz schnell, wenn du sie gut durchkaust dauert es keine Viertelstunde bis du die ersten Effekte wahrnimmst. So war es auch und ich dachte mir: Das DMT kommt nicht mehr, schlie\xdflich ist es strukturell ja fast mit dem Psilocy(bi)n identisch (nur eine Hydroxylgruppe bzw. Phosphoestergruppe weniger) und m\xfc\xdfte - dachte ich mir - deshalb auch so schnell wirken (sp\xe4ter kam es noch - und zwar ganz gewaltig, anscheinend dauerte das Aufl\xf6sen der Gelatinekapsel l\xe4nger, als ich erwartet hatte.)\r\n\r\nDie ersten Effekte von Tryptaminverbindungen sind bei mir immer K\xe4lte. Ich beginne zu frieren und wei\xdf, jetzt f\xe4ngt die Wirkung an. Deutliche Effekte waren ungef\xe4r um 1930 zu versp\xfcren. Psilocybin wirkt optisch, aber nicht sehr akustisch, w\xe4hrend DMT sowohl stark optisch als auch schw\xe4cher akustisch wirkt (Ich hatte schon mehrere DMT-Turns durch Rauchen und einen durch orale Aufnahme erlebt und hatte noch bei keinem deutliche akustische Warnehmungen). Die akustischen Effekte treten nach meiner Erfahrung erst bei h\xf6heren Dosen auf, da im Verlauf des Trips \xfcberaus deutliche akustische Effekte vernommen wurden, ging ich davon aus dass ich eine starke Dosis eingenommen hatte. Ich fror immer st\xe4rker, deshalb zog ich 4 (!) T-Shirts unter meinen Pulli, legte mich ins Bett und wickelte eine Decke um mich und legte noch eine Decke drauf. Unangenehmerweise fror ich noch immer. Ich schlo\xdf die Augen und sofort begannen die optischen Effekte vor meinem geistigen Auge: Bunte kaleidoskopartige Gebilde in extrem komplizierten (und sp\xe4ter gar nicht mehr vollkommen nachvollziehbaren) Formen, die rasend schnell wechselten und ineinander \xfcbergingen. Ich sp\xfcrte meinen K\xf6rper nicht mehr und versank im Hyperspace. Ich flog weit weg und je mehr ich mich entspannte und versuchte nicht aktiv zu denken, umso st\xe4rker wurden die Effekte. \r\n\r\nSchlie\xdflich gelangte ich in das Zentrum meines Geistes: Ich sah mich selbst als leuchtende Kugel, die von einem komplexen Gebilde, eine Art Spinnenwesen umschlossen wurde. Es war metallisch-kristallin mit einigen Dutzend spinnenartigen Ausl\xe4ufern mit Gelenken und bewegte sich. Diese \'Arme\' konnten mit anderen Dingen (Molek\xfcle ?) interagieren und wurden durch mich bzw. meinen sichtbaren Geist gesteuert. Ich dachte dies ist die Funktionsweise meines Gehirns oder der psychoaktiven Substanzen die ich genommen hatte. Dann begann die Alien-Kommunikation: Ich h\xf6rte - erst leise dann immer lauter und modulierter - T\xf6ne, wie ich sie noch nie vernommen hatte. Sie erinnerten entfernt an akustische Effekte wie sie z.B. Mischpulte besitzen, billiges Sirenengeheul oder MG-Feuer, ungef\xe4hr so wie zu C64-Zeiten. Allerdings war es viel komplexer und in rasender Folge. Ich konnte es nicht verstehen, war mir (und bin mir) aber sicher dass damit Information \xfcbertragen wurde. Ich wei\xdf nicht zwischen wem oder was, ob es die akustisch gewordene Arbeitsweise meines Gehirns oder die Kommunikation zwischen Zellen war oder ob sie mir selbst gegolten hatte, keine Ahnung. Das Spinnenwesen agierte mit irgendwelchen Strukturen und dann fiel ich wieder zur\xfcck in mein Bewu\xdftsein, da ich versehentlich aktiv dachte, statt nur \'zuzusehen\'. Die Wirkung zog sich sofort zur\xfcck und ich konnte wieder klar (aber nicht mehr lange) denken.\r\n\r\nDer Grund war dass ich so stark fror, dass es unangenehm wurde. Ich \xfcberlegte mir was der Grund daf\xfcr sein konnte, war ich doch extrem vermummt und dann fiel es mir ein: Normalerweise wenn einem kalt ist zittert man und der K\xf6rper erzeugt W\xe4rme durch Thermogenese, d.h. chemische K\xf6rperenergie wird in W\xe4rme umgewandelt. Dieser Vorgang l\xe4uft bei Bedarf (also wenn es kalt ist) ganz von alleine ab und wird vom Unterbewu\xdften oder dem Stammhirn oder so gesteuert. Da ich aber die Funktionsweise in meinem Hirn durch die psychoaktiven Verbindungen ver\xe4ndert hatte funktionierte dieser Automatismus nicht mehr, ich mu\xdfte ihn selbst bewu\xdft einschalten (vermutete ich). Also dachte ich mir: \'Thermogenese an!\' und befahl meinem K\xf6rper W\xe4rme zu erzeugen. Sofort (!) wurde mir w\xe4rmer, bis ich nach ~ 1-2 Minuten schwitzte und ich freute mich dass es so leicht funktionierte, dass ich v\xf6llige Kontrolle hatte und dass ich nicht mehr fror. Ich stand auf und ging mit starkem Torkeln ins Wohnzimmer hinab. Das Torkeln und das schwerf\xe4llige Reden kommt meiner Ansicht nach nicht von einer \'Verdummung\' durch die Droge (wobei mir dieses Wort \xfcberhaup nicht gef\xe4llt, es ist so negativ), sondern daher, dass der Geist sich vom K\xf6rper l\xf6st (wie sich unschwer an dem Erlebten feststellen l\xe4\xdft) und man daher mit seinem Geist weit weg von seinem K\xf6rper ist und somit nicht mehr v\xf6llige Kontrolle \xfcber ihn besitzt. Je mehr man sich auf k\xf6rperliche Funktionen konzentriert, desto mehr zwingt man seinen Geist wieder in seinen K\xf6rper und schr\xe4nkt damit die Erfahrung ein die dir psychoaktive Verbindungen - und auch z.B. Meditation - erm\xf6glichen. Deshalb bevorzuge ich es w\xe4hrend dem Einflu\xdf o.g. Substanzen zu meditieren und den Geist m\xf6glichst stark zu befreien (ich h\xe4tte auch meditiert, w\xe4re es nicht so kalt gewesen).\r\n\r\nIm Wohnzimmer blickte ich auf die Uhr: Es war genau 2100 Uhr. Ich wollte noch zu Freunden, wu\xdfte aber nicht mehr, ob 9 Uhr fr\xfch oder sp\xe4t war, ich hatte keinerlei Zeitgef\xfchl mehr. Also setzte ich mich erstmal auf die Couch. Ich schaltete den Fernseher ein und am\xfcsierte mich k\xf6stlich \xfcber jeden Schei\xdf: Eine Schlagers\xe4ngerin sang Volksmusik, etwas was ich mir normalerweise nie im Leben anh\xf6ren w\xfcrde, doch es hatte mir so gut gefallen, da\xdf ich sie mir eine Zeitlang anh\xf6rte, dann schaltete ich um, es lief  \'Wetten dass..?\' mim Tommy, und auch dies gefiel mir unheimlich gut, es war als ob ich mitten drin im Studio gewesen w\xe4re. Ich verstand zwar kein Wort von dem was die Personen sagten (obwohl sie deutsch sprachen), aber trotzdem gefiel es mir super. Nach l\xe4ngerer Zeit schaltete ich weiter und ganz egal was lief, alles erzeugte eine unheimliche Freude in mir und ein unheimliches Interesse, selbst beim gr\xf6ssten M\xfcll. Schlie\xdflich schaltete ich nach ungef\xe4hr einer Stunde den Fernseher aus und blickte auf unseren Hund, ein kleiner Chihuahua der die ganze Zeit brav dagesessen hatte, mich dann ansah und auf mich zulief. Er setzte sich neben mich und war eine Zeit lang ruhig. Dann, nachdem ich meine Aufmerksamkeit l\xe4ngere Zeit auf ihn gerichtet hatte, rastete er pl\xf6tzlich aus und verdrehte seinen Kopf, begann zu husten und sprang wie wild hin und her, begann zu bellen, fiel auf den R\xfccken und verdrehte sich und h\xf6rte nicht mehr auf. Irgendwann nach mehreren Minuten wurde ich w\xfctend und wollte ihm eine auf den Arsch schlagen, damit er Ruhe gibt, aber dann dachte ich mir, da\xdf er vielleicht pinkeln mu\xdf und wollte ihn rauslassen. Er wollte aber nicht. Ich wei\xdf nicht genau was er wollte, vielleicht fressen, aber ich hatte ihn noch nie so ausrasten gesehen und vermute dass er von der Wirkung des DMTs und der Pilze auch etwas \'abgekriegt\' hatte, als er sich neben mich setzte.\r\n\r\nDann ging ich wieder hoch und legte mich erneut ins Bett. Ich entspannte mich und die Wirkung wurde st\xe4rker. Sie kam in Sch\xfcben und jeder Schub war wie ein Turbo der mich schneller in den Hyperspace beschleunigte. Ich lief auf einem Bergr\xfccken und beiderseits ging es ins Verderben, der Zustand, den ich erreichen w\xfcrde, wenn ich die Kontrolle verlieren w\xfcrde. Es war ein Balanceakt und er wurde mit jedem Schub schwieriger. Mir wurde immer \xfcbler, nicht direkt k\xf6rperlich, mehr auf einer geistigen Ebene. Ich stand auf und zog einige Shirts aus, ich dachte mir vielleicht ist dir mittlerweile zu warm, aber das war es nicht. Ich ging pissen, aber das war es auch nicht, dann fiel ich mehr oder weniger die Treppen runter in die K\xfcche und wollte einen Milchreis essen, ich dachte mir vielleicht brauchst du Nahrung, aber ich konnte kaum den L\xf6ffel halten, alles schwankte und nach ein paar L\xf6ffeln stellte ich fest dass es das auch nicht war.\r\n\r\nIch torkelte wieder ins Wohnzimmer und legte mich auf die Couch. Die Wirkung wurde immer st\xe4rker und ich sah nichts mehr. Dann kam wieder ein Schub und ich dachte mir: Noch ein, zwei Sch\xfcbe und es \xfcberw\xe4ltigt dich, dann verlierst du die Kontrolle. Ich hatte schon viel Erfahrung mit psychoaktiven Verbindungen (LSD, Meskalin, Pilze, DMT) und auch in hohen Dosen, aber noch nie hatte ich so eine harte Dosis dass ich die Kontrolle verloren hatte und nicht mehr Herr meiner Selbst war. Dann kam wieder ein Schub und ich f\xfcrchtete ich m\xfc\xdfte mich \xfcbergeben. Ich stand wieder auf, torkelte durch den Raum und sah auf die Uhr. Ich war der Meinung ungef\xe4hr die H\xe4lfte der Wirkung m\xfc\xdfte vorbei sein und sch\xe4tzte auf 11 Uhr. Ich fiel fast um als ich sah dass es erst 2104 war!! Ich hatte vor 4 Minuten auf die Uhr gesehen und seitdem Ewigkeiten verbracht mit Fernsehen, im Bett liegen, den Hund rauslassen, im Wohnzimmer sitzen, essen usw. und dann bekam ich Schiss: Wenn es jetzt noch st\xe4rker w\xfcrde und die Zeit subjektiv extrem langsam verlief w\xfcrde ich mich noch sehr lange in diesem zu harten Zustand befinden. Und so kam es auch. Ich fiel aufs Sofa und dann kam der n\xe4chste Schub und dann war die Wirkung so stark, da\xdf ich ausklinkte. \r\n\r\nAlles danach waren nur noch Gef\xfchle in einem traum\xe4hnlichen Kontiuum. Die Zeit verlief immer langsamer und mit diesem letzten Schub (vielleicht kamen noch mehr, aber diese registrierte ich dann nicht mehr) blieb sie stehen. Ich wu\xdfte nicht mehr wer oder wo ich war, ich wu\xdfte nicht mehr dass es Gestern und Morgen gibt, ich war der Meinung dass ich schon mein ganzes Leben in diesem station\xe4ren Zustand verbracht hatte. Es war die Ewigkeit, aber sie war nicht positiv denn ich hatte unheimlich starke Schmerzen, allerdings nicht k\xf6rperlich, sondern irgendwie geistig. Es hat also nicht in meinem Kopf geschmerzt, (das w\xe4re ja auch k\xf6rperlich gewesen) sondern ich befand mich mit meinem Geist in einem Zustand ewigen Schmerzes und da ich der Auffassung war dass dieser Zustand unendlich lange w\xe4hrt und niemals enden w\xfcrde bekam ich richtige Angst. Ich dachte, dass dies der Zustand ist den die Buddhisten mit Leidenskreislauf benennen. Mit Ausbruch aus dem ewigen Leiden und dass ich nur durch meinen Tod Erl\xf6sung finden w\xfcrde. Da ich nicht mehr wusste, dass ich mich nur in einem vor\xfcbergehenden Stadium befand sondern annahm es m\xfcsste f\xfcr alle Ewigkeit so bleiben und w\xe4re schon immer so gewesen, blieb mir nur der Tod als Ausweg aus diesem Zustand unbeschreiblicher Schmerzen.\r\n\r\nIch wollte mich erschie\xdfen, aber ich hatte keine Pistole, dann wollte ich mich erh\xe4ngen, hatte schon den G\xfcrtel in der Hand, wusste aber nicht mehr, wie es geht. Dann wusste ich dass ich einfach loslassen kann. Ich lag auf dem Bett und war so weit weg, dass nur noch ein kleiner Schritt gefehlt h\xe4tte und ich w\xe4re nicht mehr zur\xfcckgekommen (zumindest kam es mir so vor). Ich dachte, wenn ich jetzt loslasse sterbe ich, aber ich war mir nicht sicher, ob dass das Problem l\xf6sen w\xfcrde, oder ob ich dann weiterhin in diesem Zustand w\xe4re.\r\nIch sah kurz ein Telefon vor mir und dachte, dass jemand das erfunden hat um mit jemand anderem Kontakt aufzunehmen, aber ich wu\xdfte nicht mehr, wie man es benutzt. Ich dachte mir: \'Bin ich ein Mensch? Dann mu\xdf ich bestimmte Dinge tun\' und ich \xfcberlegte was ein Mensch machen muss um nicht zu sterben. Dann fiel es mir ein: Pinkeln, das mu\xdf man immer wieder mal machen, dachte ich mir und fiel aufs Klo, aber ich konnte nicht urinieren. Essen fiel mir auch ein, aber ich war nicht mehr in der Lage so etwas motorisch komplexes wie Nahrungsaufnahme durchzuf\xfchren. Ich dachte mir, wenn meine Eltern zur\xfcckkommen, dann liege ich tot auf dem Boden, verhungert, und sie fragen sich warum ich nichts gegessen habe. Dann war ich mir gar nicht mehr sicher, ob sie \xfcberhaupt weg waren, oder wer \xfcberhaupt hier war (niemand au\xdfer mir). \r\n\r\nDann fiel mir noch ein, was man machen musste, um zu \xfcberleben: Atmen und ich holte tief Luft und begann mehrere Male zu schnaufen, aber der Schmerz ging nicht weg, er dauerte Ewigkeiten und war st\xe4rker als alle anderen Schmerzen die ich jemals durchleben mu\xdfte. Ich dachte, ich sterbe. Irgendwann wu\xdfte ich dass ich nicht sterbe und das machte es noch viel schlimmer, weil dies implizierte dass es keine Erl\xf6sung gab.\r\n\r\nIch entfernte mich immer mehr, war nur noch Geist in einem unendlichen Raum voller Schmerz in dem es keine Zeit mehr gab. Es war ein ewigw\xe4hrender Zustand des Leidens, keinerlei optische / akustische Halluzinationen mehr, nur noch zeitlose Schw\xe4rze und ewiger Schmerz. Mein Bewusstsein hatte sich aufgel\xf6st. Ich wu\xdfte nicht mehr wer/was ich bin und war mir nicht mehr meiner selbst bewu\xdft. Um ~ 0100 Uhr wusste ich ganz pl\xf6tzlich (wie Schalter umlegen) wieder wer ich war und wo ich war und konnte wieder denken. Ich hatte wieder ein Bewu\xdftsein erlangt und konnte mich an die meisten erlebten Sachen erinnern. Ich dankte Gott dass es vorbei war und sagte mir dass es so in der H\xf6lle sein musste wenn es eine gab und dass ich nie nie mehr so etwas erleben wollte. Im Verlauf mehrerer Stunden lie\xdf die \xdcbelkeit immer mehr nach, w\xe4hrend der eigentliche Schmerz, das eigentlich furchtbare, mit dem Erlangen des Bewu\xdftseins schlagartig aufh\xf6rte. Deshalb vermute ich dass es nicht z. B. der K\xe4se der Pizza war der zusammen mit dem MAO-Hemmer toxisch wirkte, oder da\xdf es von irgendwelchen Abbauprodukten des nicht frisch synthetisierten DMTs herr\xfchrte, sondern ich vermute dass es die zu starke Wirkung des DMTs selbst war, da ich weiss dass es eine der m\xe4chtigsten (vielleicht sogar die m\xe4chtigste) Struktur ist die dieser Planet (bisher) bietet. Nicht aufgrund der ben\xf6tigten Menge f\xfcr einen Turn, sondern aufgrund der Wirkung die es ausl\xf6sen kann. Nach vielen Stunden schlie\xdflich (7 Uhr morgens) wurde ich m\xfcde und schlief, nachdem ich schweigend stundenlang \xfcber dieses schockierende Erlebnis nachgedacht hatte, ein.\r\n\r\nWas ist im nachhinein zu sagen?\r\nNach ~1 Tag war alles wieder normal und auch die letzten inneren Gef\xfchle an den Turn waren verschwunden. Die Erinnerung an diesen h\xf6llischen Schmerz verblasst und ich kann ihn schon gar nicht mehr richtig nachvollziehen, aber ich kann mich daran erinnern wie ich dachte dass es unglaublich schmerzhaft ist und wie ich dachte, dass ich diesen Schmerz nie mehr erleben wollte. Das war das negative an dem Turn. Positiv war die Erfahrung der v\xf6lligen Zeitlosigkeit, d.h. das Empfinden eines statischen Zustandes, das war sehr interessant. Ebenfalls interessant war die v\xf6llige Aufl\xf6sung der Pers\xf6nlichkeit und damit noch weitergehend die Aufl\xf6sung des Bewu\xdftseins. Ein unglaublicher Zustand, v\xf6llig urt\xfcmlich und unkonditioniert. Das g\xf6ttliche Verst\xe4ndnis f\xfcr alle m\xf6glichen philosophischen Fragen die sich in diesen Zust\xe4nden l\xf6sen lassen verschwindet leider mit dem Ende des Turns und zumeist auch die Erinnerung daran. Woher diese toxische Reaktion stammt, wei\xdf ich nicht. Vielleicht einfach ein ungl\xfccklich verlaufener Trip, oder doch Abbauprodukte des DMTs mit unangenehmen Wirkungen? Beim Rauchen ohne MAO-Hemmer ist das nicht so schlimm, dann dauert der Turn nur wenigen Minuten, aber mit MAO-Hemmer musst du den Zustand einige Stunde erdulden. Ein deutlicher Unterschied zu gerauchtem DMT: Wenn ich DMT rauche habe ich immer das Gef\xfchl dass pl\xf6tzlich eine Person mehr im Raum ist. Der Grund daf\xfcr ist dass ich meinen K\xf6rper verlasse (zumindest kommt es mir so vor) und dass ich mich dann selbst doppelt z\xe4hle: Einmal mich (also meinen Geist, mein Bewu\xdftsein) und dann noch meinen K\xf6rper. Dies war bei oraler Aufnahme nicht so, aber vielleicht auch nur bei diesem Turn oder durch den Zusatz an Pilz."
115921,Deep Insight,Stew,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nBackground: Generalised anxiety disorder, following childhood trauma. \r\n\r\nThe start of the trip was following 2g of dried Liberty caps; at least that was my assumption - there were around 70-80 Liberty caps. The first gram I had soaked in lemon juice and following the consumption of these I felt nothing. I assumed I had built up a tolerance after consuming 0.5g 2 days earlier. I then decided to take the last gram that I had and decided to run some errands in town. \r\n\r\nWhilst out I started to notice enhanced sound and vision and could feel something building, so I made my way home quickly. I laid down on my bed, put some headphones in and started listening to Mozart\x92s Lacrimosa. Very soon I started to have visuals both with my eyes open and closed. I started to see very detailed paint texture on the ceiling and then beautiful shapes like snowflakes on the ceiling too, which I\'ve later learnt are fractals. When I closed my eyes the red from the sun was intensely bright and filled me with incredible warmth. The choir in Lacrimosa were lifting me up to what felt like the heavens and I found myself in a crucifix position in pure ecstasy. Following this I found myself diving for the window sill in order to look directly into the sun and the effects were dramatic; the particles and colours and feelings were pure ecstasy and the love I felt was more intense than anything I\'ve felt. I was immediately reduced to just being fixated on the sun in a loving gaze. I reached an extreme level of being filled with love that I can\x92t describe nor remember. I flopped back onto the bed, I think and the order of events is very difficult to recall as time vanished.\r\n\r\nAfter the ecstasy of the beginning of the trip I started to sense that god was a woman and I believe this was confusion with yearning for a mother  - this I understood was something deep-rooted that I\'ve yearned for since being a small child. I opened my eyes and found that I was repeating \x93mother\x94. I then had a visual of being a baby and seeing the umbilical chord stretching up. I believe I was in the womb. There were feelings of being protected. \r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the trip I had told myself I wanted to know the meaning of everything and I wanted to be cured of my deep rooted anxiety. I knew in the trip that the deep anxiety and pain resided in my gut. I then experienced mushrooms which grew from my gut and came out of my mouth. As the mushrooms were uprooted from my gut, all the pain that was stored there was pulled out of me, this was a feeling of intense relief. Despite all of this healing, I realised that the me as a child was not healed. I had to heal the child that I was too and when I did, I said he\x92s ok, he\x92s ok and that felt settled, I could let go. I can\x92t explain where the ecstasy came from after that, maybe I can\x92t describe it, I just know it. I then saw the most incredible moving geometric shapes and in this fabric, the shapes were turning inward like a barber\x92s pole. Scattered across this fabric were small jester faces and chequered patterns.\r\n\r\nI had a full convulsion body orgasm and I groaned and exhaled as this occurred, I surrendered to it. I took the deepest breaths I ever had that went on forever. I surrendered to it. I took the deepest breaths I ever had that went on forever. I stretched my jaw and my back and these stretches went on forever with all the knots and stress leaving my body.\r\n\r\nI dived face first into the bedsheets and felt I had to suffocate my ego, to kill it and as I did so my face sunk into the duvet and all I saw were dark geometric landscapes. I felt I had already touched heaven and as the trip evolved into darker visuals and landscapes I felt I was going into a hell but I had seen god/love and I knew that hell was the ego and made up. I didn\x92t fear it, this quickly dissolved the dark images, I think.\r\n\r\nThe next stage of the trip was the longest and the most terrifying.\r\n\r\nAs it changed, I felt I had been as far as you can go and further in than anyone has before. I felt that I had seen the truth and that I am god and that everyone is me, well not me but the one \x93I\x94 and there was severe loneliness as I existed alone and this was because I knew everyone else was me. Maybe this lonely feeling was the ego hanging on. I realised that we go around thinking I am just me because that is the whole point. The beautiful trick that God is all things and doesn\x92t know it itself. Alan Watts had it right. I also heard his quote: when you get the message, hang up the phone. My ego started to get more involved and I left my bed, I felt I had lost my life and said how can I carry on with life now that I know what the truth behind all reality. I thought I would have to live as Eckhart Tolle does. I began to yearn to be the little me again. I went into the bathroom and the patterns on the marble floor tiles were all moving, I saw through and into my arms and this was terrifying. My hands in front of me, were vivid in colour and were orange and as if not belonging to me. I went into the bathroom again and thought I was losing my mind. I chattered, crying like my mother \x93I don\x92t want to lose my mind!\x94, or something like that. The horror. A lot happened after. I was on my knees at the top of the stairs, I thought I had already died. I went to my phone to see if my wife had called, then I said to myself \x93am I my wife?\x94. I was so terrified that I went up to my daughter\x92s bedroom, hoping to sleep and get away from this. I felt a hand on the back of my head, this was calming. I asked to be back in my body as the little me and yearned for my old problems and my worries, which at this moment were the heaven I yearned for. I was choosing to be back as I was and not wanting to live in the truth as it would completely shatter my sense of self.\r\n\r\nI heard my wife come in and my daughter was having a meltdown (this actually happened and wasn\x92t a trip). I went into see them in the kitchen and my wife couldn\x92t calm her down. I just sat on the floor, everything looked cold, like the tungsten white balance on a camera. The usual stress I would feel in this situation wasn\x92t there. I went back to flop on the bed. I felt infinity as time no longer existed. This was hellish. I didn\x92t think I was coming back but I gradually did, in very long eternal stages. As the trip drew to a close, I phoned my wife and walked out to meet them in the park. I\x92ve never felt so good and so much love before. The dull pain of anxiety that has resided in my gut for decades was finally gone, I now want to live for others and I\'ve never felt so light. As I write this now my back is still loosening up after years of stress now dissipating. I\'m struggling now to understand what I saw and felt but I feel a huge shift in everything."
104734,Tripping Over Myself,Verntelk,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nSource:\r\nI picked these mushrooms with friends in Wales a few weeks ago. It was our first time picking but we were confident or at least cautious about IDing the right ones. If any specimens looked doubtful we avoided them.  We ate 30 each and walked around the hills for four hours, stopping to pick more occasionally. Came home with 60 mushrooms, dried them and stored them in a jar of honey.\r\n\r\nBackground to this trip:\r\nI\'ve taken mushrooms before a few times, and this is the second time I\'ve taken them since trying ayahuasca for the first time two months ago. Out of an interest in micro-dosing I\'d had a few half-teaspoons from the jar earlier in the week (to subtle and pleasant effect), but I was waiting for a good time to experiment with tripping alone (to study the effects on drawing and music). The opportunity came today whilst looking after my mum\'s flat, and thinking I was giving myself a comfortable dose to begin with, I took a teaspoon of the mushrooms in honey. \r\n\r\nThe first hour was fascinating, enjoyable and surprisingly intense. I sat in the living room with a ukulele and pen and paper, playing and watching the visuals arrive. The carpet rippled and the blinds waved around a bit, and the sunbeams seemed to coincide with my playing. I was restless and indecisive so put the ukulele down and began drawing. As my eyes focused on the pen moving around the paper I noticed in the periphery of my vision that there were people kneeling against me, some sitting at the sofa, one on the floor resting against my knee. All faces were turned to me and some of them were patting my legs and shoulders. I kept staring at the paper but was surprised and glad to see it was the same group of dark blue/black beings I met whilst taking ayahuasca. \r\n\r\nThoughts at the time:\r\n-Complete surprise at the intensity of the visuals and setting. Someone described the feeling ayahuasca creates as that of \'an inhabited space\', and this felt like exactly the same \'room\'.\r\n-Curious and glad to see the ayahuasca gang here in the mushroom kingdom, I paid more attention to them out of the corner of my eyes than caring what I was drawing, and at this point felt convinced I was holding the pen on their behalf and drawing what they wanted.\r\n\r\nI needed the toilet at this point, and from then on my headspace dissolved into complete panicked incoherence. I walked between all rooms of the house looking for something whilst undressing, trying to run a bath, turning the boiler on and off and beginning to feel very nauseous. The sound of the water coming out of the taps exacerbated this. As my panic increased I tried to check the situation against former mushroom use. \r\nThe facts as I had them:\r\n-\'Every trip you\'ve had, you\'ve eaten more mushrooms than this.\'\r\n-\'You\'ve never felt sick before taking mushrooms, and even expecting some mushroom nausea, such a strong reaction from such a small dose is very concerning.\'\r\n\r\nFeeling that nauseous, I decided to cut to the chase and make myself sick. I did so but it didn\'t make me feel any better. In this worried state I then began to doubt my mushroom IDing and sorting In this worried state I then began to doubt my mushroom IDing and sorting, and as I grew hotter in the face and my heart started racing I began to wonder if I\'d been poisoned. I began to panic and tried to find my phone to get numbers of friends I could call whilst also trying to check online to see what lookalike species I may\'ve picked (I\'d already looked this up a few weeks ago but didn\'t find a comprehensive guide). My inability to focus on anything at all drove my pulse up as unconfirmed stories of friend\'s friends (and the guy who wrote the horse whisperer) getting poisoned by shrooms flapped around my head. In a crescendo of fungi paranoia I bit the bullet, flushed my jar of poisoned (and thus useless) shrooms and called an ambulance on the house phone.\r\n\r\nFollowing their instructions I sat waiting with my wallet and the scrapings of the jar for ID purposes and written phone numbers of the next of kin I could remember, furiously scribbling down a note of my last thoughts. I was convinced I was dying and even remarked how strange that was, given that my vital signs were all ok. My head was getting lighter/out of body and my vision was spinning out, and this combined with the panic made me think I was leaving the world.\r\n\r\nThe ambulance arrives, the two paramedics take one look at me and roll their eyes, stick me in the back so as not to make a scene on the doorstep and we have a chat. Well, sitting in a parked ambulance tripping my tits off and chatting with these two seemed to calm me down. To say they were cynical is an understatement but they answered my questions and conceded I actually wasn\'t the biggest time waster they\'d had. They said I could come to hospital if I really wanted but I didn\'t seem to be having any more poisoning symptoms than the average tripper, and if it was something odd in the batch I\'d probably vomited it out. I spent the afternoon coming back into coherence, lying in bed listening to an Eno/Fripp album and enjoying the last of the closed-eye visuals.\r\n\r\nNot the day I wanted but definitely what I needed in terms of a reminder. This experience was me being grabbed by the head and rubbed through the shit of two obvious lessons I\'d read but not learnt. \r\n\r\n1. Have 100% veracity on the mushroom sources with no room for doubt. A rough and ready psilocybe approach (can ID liberty caps but patchy knowledge of lookalikes) has served me well so far and I doubt the mushrooms were poisonous, but I\'d rather know, and for me that means familiarising myself with any lookalikes.\r\n\r\n2. Start soloing with a sitter on hand. The bigger lesson probably. If I\'d ever had a bad trip before, I don\'t think I would have tried solo tripping for the first time without a sitter.\r\n\r\nI lost some self-respect (especially next time I see an ambulance pass) and what may have just been a decent jar of super strong mushrooms, but on the plus side I couldn\'t find my phone so didn\'t call all my friends and family with my last will and testament.\r\n\r\nI\'m still very surprised that a teaspoon of dried caps sent me a visit from the ayahuasca family. At most this was maybe a quarter of the mushroom content of the jar (the rest of the 200ml jar was filled up with honey). That would mean about 15 liberty caps. This is a generous estimate as it looked smaller, but I\'m trying to account for the intensity. Perhaps its a strong year for UK shrooms."
106658,The Discovery of My Eternal Self,Dante,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIt was the second year after I rediscovered psychedelics. I had experimented with lower to medium doses of shrooms, but this autumn I was going all in, the McKenna way. Ego death is the goal. So, the night was there, the mushrooms picked and dried. Terence famously preaches 5 grams, alone, in silent darkness.\r\n\r\nI am a cautious person, so I modified the dose a bit. I am a cautious person, so I modified the dose a bit. The Liberty Caps in Norway are known to be quite a bit more potent than Terence\'s Cubensis, I was on the light side (69 kg) and had a low tolerance. So, the heroic dose was calculated to be 3 grams in lemon tek. The rest of the setting was perfect. Total darkness, in bed, and my wife in the living room. Well rested and a day of fasting.\r\n\r\nIt hits incredibly fast. The come up is quite chaotic, like a roller coaster of crazy visuals, impossible to grasp anything from. I lie in bed and hold on, bracing myself.\r\n\r\nAt a point a very strange world emerges. Its is very hard to describe but its something like; Super brilliant colors in incredible high def, with geometric shapes and patterns changing around in a way so perfect and coordinated, I am totally baffled. A show off of geometric clockwork, made with a perfection that is beyond comprehension. Like a mathematical engine room of the universe.\r\n\r\nIts size, or distance is impossible to point out, and it somehow doesn\'t matter. It could be a parallel universe, inside an atom or a hidden space in my head, but still all-encompassing.\r\n\r\nTogether with this, a kind of ambient, very alien and quite scary music plays in the background. At a point creatures starts to appear. Very strange and alien looking. Some humanoid, and some insect-like. And their attitude is quite unwelcoming, like they are guardians of this realm, and would rather I was not there.\r\n\r\nI finds it all extremely weird and quite disturbing, and when one of the insectoids moves towards me in a threatening matter, I try to open my eyes and get up, to try to change the scenery. I stumble in to the toilet and splash water in my face and go back to bed.\r\n\r\nBut, the shrooms are still coming up, and my attempts to take control are useless. And in a moment of fear, I surrender.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I am gone. Every fragment of myself is gone. No visuals. Just an eternal sensation. Suddenly I am gone. Every fragment of myself is gone. No visuals. Just an eternal sensation. A sensation of the soul, my true self. The self I have always been, and always will be. I am in total control and without control, I am nothing and everything, simultaneously. I am outside time and space. \r\n\r\nI just exist, like an eternal light, drifting in eternity. \r\n\r\nMerging in to other personalities. \r\n\r\nRushes of revelations.\r\n\r\nHow long this moment lasted in real-time is impossible to know. \r\n\r\nWhen I get back to myself, I just lay there, upside down in bed, tears running down my face, with an extreme feeling of bliss.\r\n\r\nThe comedown is very nice. Giggling, crying and feeling very satisfied, though left with a new respect for the power of the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nI have not mustered the courage to go back there yet, but have had several sessions of a more moderate character after. The strange thing is, I get back in to that geometric universe every time. Even on low-end doses, then off course in a lesser, more manageable degree. But every time I have been able to enjoy and cope with it better and better, and the creatures seems to take less notice of me."
109644,A Powerful Tool for Enlightenment,Merry Prankster,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nFrom the time I was a child, I had always been skeptical of the existence of \x93God.\x94 Being raised Jewish in a not-particularly-religious environment, it was of no consequence what I believed, and I am thankful I grew up in an environment where I could think independently about what I believed, not what I \x93should\x94 believe. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, around my senior year in high school, my friends and I began to become enthralled with the writings of Henry David Thoreau and the transcendentalists. Their belief in the \x93oneness\x94 of the universe and all things, living or not, really struck a chord with us, and I began to contemplate that maybe there was a God, not as some white man in a throne looking down at his subjects, but as the innate connectivity of all matter and beings.\r\n\r\nFast forward to my junior year in college.\t\r\nHaving little experience in the psychedelic realm, but much curiosity, I decided it would be in my best interest to start with mushrooms. I had many connections to get some of California\x92s finest fungi (born and raised in the Bay Area), and I really wanted a period of intense introspection to see what I might learn. I got an eighth of Liberty Caps, but decided only to eat half, as they are a potent species. With all of my work taken care of, I went to bed early on Friday with the intention of taking the mushrooms on Saturday.\r\n\t\r\nAt 8 am, I ate the half eighth I had measured out on my scale without a breakfast, and within 15 minutes, felt a sense of great anxiety. The question: \x93What if I have a bad trip?\x94 sped through my mind on loop. I drank some water, and tried calming myself down. I decided I should take a walk on the beach, to get myself in the right mindset. As I got up from my desk, I noticed the wood grain on my door \x93flowing.\x94 I began to get much more anxious. \x93It\x92s only been 25 minutes, I\x92m not even close to the peak\x94 I thought with terror.\r\n\t\r\nUpon walking down the gated neighborhood\x92s road to the beach, I turned some peaceful music to help turn the trip around to a \x93good experience.\x94 I have always been a fan of Led Zeppelin, and I turned on their song: \x93Since I\x92ve Been Loving You.\x94 Subconsciously, I attached that song to a girl I loved my sophomore year of college, one that had driven me to deep depression and alcohol abuse. And there, in the road, among all the breathing and moving trees and surfaces, she stood, screaming and crying. I spent the next 7 minutes in the greatest repentance and sorrow I could ever possibly fathom. I was on the road surface, crying and wailing. I was forced to confront my worst memories of my experience with her, suppressed by my brain. In the silence between the Zep song and the next song on my playlist, I sat there, completely frozen, and said quietly: \x93I\x92m sorry.\x94 What happened upon muttering those words defies any explanation, but it seemed as though all of the deep seeded anxiety and lingering depression around my feelings for her left my physical being with the words I uttered. I began to cry again at the beginning of the next song, \x93Blue Skies\x94 by Willie Nelson, but this time, tears of pure joy, passion, forgiveness, for myself and for her. \r\n\t\r\nI had finally made it to the beach at around 9 am. I was growing more nauseous, almost seasick, and sat on the soft sand, watching the waves break. At this point I began to really hallucinate hard. I must have a low tolerance to psilocybin, because of how fast and hard the trip hit on such a relatively low dose. The hallucinations before me were very intricate and detailed, but had a seemingly \x93overlaid\x94 appearance. I could tell they weren\x92t there, but could see them nonetheless. I closed my eyes, and was taken into a 3 dimensional world of infinitely complex living diamond patterns. I grew more dizzy from this and opened my eyes, and I got up and went walking down the beach.\r\n\t\r\nMy level of anxiety was still very high, but I had been able to stay out of a nightmarish hell, like the many bad trips I have read about. Much of the trip that followed was almost a dream; difficult to remember or differentiate what was real, and what was imagined, but I\x92ll do my best to retell the parts I can. Everything looked like a mystical slime world, something out of the Lord of the Rings series. I remember reaching the end of the beach, at a military installation, and talking to one of the soldiers. I remember she said something to the effect that I could walk no further, as there was a drill going on that involved live fire. Upon turning away, a strange feeling hit me, like I had just been blasted by a ray of intense light. I could feel it rising inside me, from my groin, up my stomach, to my throat\x85and then I giggled more intensely and passionately than I could ever conceive. The cosmic giggles had struck, and it really helped to reduce my anxiety. The cosmic giggles had struck, and it really helped to reduce my anxiety. At this point, around 10, I had peaked, and was at the plateau. With my anxiety gone, I became very at peace, with a sense that everything will be all right. I began to think about my spirituality and the notion of death and God. \r\n\t\r\nMushrooms helped me think in a very unifying way, as though I were just part of something much bigger as opposed to a singular human adrift in the world alone. I began to think about all that the transcendentalists had preached about, oneness, and connectivity with nature. I felt throughout the trip that the boundaries between objects were null, that they were human demarcations that held no weight. At that moment, I could not tell where my body ended and the sand began. And at that moment there on the beach, without warning, it happened: I understood the notion of God. No words could possibly begin to describe to the idea of universal connectivity and a wholly encompassing being of the universe in a way that makes sense to the sober mind. Mushrooms allowed my brain to comprehend what I had held as true, and reaffirmed what I believed about God, and death, being a return to God and the universe. \tMuch of the peak following is a blur, but I do recall feeling something in my shoe, looking at what it was, and the thing in my shoe I found to be my foot.\r\n\r\nThe comedown was intensely pleasant. I listened to the Grateful Dead and just walked around, for the first time in a long time completely at peace with myself, living fully in the moment. I bought a burrito, and ate it at a park bench while I watched ducks waddle near a small pond. Life is good. In the hours following, I developed a powerful headache, at some points incapacitating, which went away with a good night\x92s sleep of 12 hours.\r\n\t\r\nThat was the single most powerful emotional introspection I had ever had to this point, I feel in the aftermath the feeling of wellbeing, the feeling that my anxiety and depression are contained, and that what remains I can help myself with. I feel as refreshed as if an intense weight has been lifted off my shoulders, not by the mushrooms, but by myself having personally overcome many of my problems. I see mushrooms not as an answer to life\x92s problems, but as a powerful tool useful in understanding the questions to life\x92s problems. I was able to work out some of my problems while under the influence of mushrooms, I didn\x92t give my problems to the mushrooms to work out while I tripped, the effort was my own. The mushrooms gave me the mind that was necessary in making the progress in finding answers. Above all, after this trip, I am more confident than ever that all of the universe is linked in some way, being innately sacred, and that brings with it enormous relief, and a sense that I can stop worrying about finding answers, and start living again."
109530,A Sweet Release,Joseph,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIt had been a long time coming.  Finally, a good friend of mine came across some Liberty Caps. Up to this point I had exhaustively studied the fine details about the psychedelic experience.  I had logged at least 70-100 hours of Terence McKenna, along with reading many experiences.  My curiosity had arisen with the onset of the Internet and all of its appendages, particularly YouTube.  The amount of information I was being exposed to in my early teens drastically changed my outlook in life.  Life became more meaningful, purposeful, fulfilling and quite confusing.  My curiosity for eccentricity led me into the wondrous world of psychedelics. \r\n\r\nThe big day had finally arrived. There was L, R, J and myself.  L had scored some mushrooms; he had about 10 grams for four of us to split.  We each consumed roughly 2.5 grams.  We were in L\x92s small backyard garage.  It wasn\x92t so much a garage anymore; L had successfully turned it into a decently liveable space with a few couches and a TV. It was a Friday night and L had consumed the same batch of mushrooms a few weeks earlier, L warned us these mushrooms were fairly strong.  R and J, my two other friends, including myself, were all doing mushrooms for the first time.  L laid the mushrooms on a small wooden table centered between all four of us, an eerie nervousness swept upon us.  In retrospect being nervous is a sign of respect. None of us planned on doing these drugs for reasons of self-gratification, in the traditional sense of scoring a buzz.  We were aware of the powerful affects and the potential dangers these substances possessed.  Nervousness is a good a thing! \r\n\r\nAbout 45 minutes in the effects slowly crept into my consciousness.  The world started shifting in a subtle manner.  \r\n\r\nThe slow phlegmatic movement of my observable world brought about a disconcerting sensation. I looked towards the white clock in the corner of the room and thought to myself, \x91my god I have at least 4 more hours of this.\x94 Right then and there the long arduous days of research, the late nights listening to Terence McKenna and all the personal experiences I read came roaring into my consciousness. I realized I had two choices, either I let whatever the hell is happening to me take over, or, I fight it and run the risk of a creating a disastrous trip.  I took a couple deep breaths and let it all go. I took a couple deep breaths and let it all go.\r\n\r\nDuring this eureka moment my friend L had sparked a joint.  I took a few smooth puffs of the joint and watched as the smoke rose and danced its way towards the ceiling.  The smoke had upgraded into high definition.  My consciousness lost connection with all else other than watching the smoke swift and swirl into majestic patterns of flexibility.  At this point the visuals came on very strongly.  I looked at L and I swear it seemed I had complete x-ray vision; I was able to see the fine details of L\x92s jawbones. R was silent and he remained silent for the whole trip.  I\x92m not kidding, we sat for about 6 hours and he did not utter a word until we both got in a cab to leave.  He would later tell me his experience was intense and generally very positive.  He didn\x92t give a coherent answer as to why he remained silent throughout the trip.   \r\n\r\nAnyhow back to my trip, I remember looking towards J who had his head in his hands.  He seemed to not be doing so well but what I was going through quickly distracted me from my friends in the room.  Every time I looked at J sitting across from me I could see a parallel dimension of his own body, as if there were two infinity mirrors on either side, but instead of seeing an infinite amount of J\x92s I just saw the J in one dimension over to the right and one dimension over to the left and the regular J in between. The next intense visual was in the center of the room; I saw a complex and intricate oval shaped object made of pure energy. It was a beautiful object, reminded me almost of a crystallizing igloo, made with translucent tubes that had blindingly powerful plasma circulating throughout its design.  It would fade in and out of my perception.  \r\n\r\nThe night continued and around my peak, about two hours in I had complete and utter ego death.  Fortunately for me, the whole process of getting to ego death had been completely salient and anxiety-free.  My spirit was soaring.  I was in a euphoric stream of endless joy.  The ecstasy that came with doing mushrooms is what truly surprised me. I had always associated highs and lows and ups and downs with drugs such as stimulants, depressants, uppers, downers, Alcohol, Cocaine, drugs that either suppress or stimulate the motor functions. Experiencing a very high-up stimulant feeling along with the psychedelic experience was glorious.   \r\n\r\nMore importantly when I used my mind to think about life everything had quickly lost its meaning. I was no longer J, the thought of being myself was such a foreign and bizarre concept that at one point I convinced myself I would never come back down to reality. And, quite frankly, I absolutely loved it.  The feeling of freedom and being able to let go of the baggage that builds upon our ego throughout life was a heavenly release.  The habitual processes of my consciousness and subconsciousness no longer tightened their chains upon my soul.  Instead there was clarity and time to question my life and existence.  Although mushrooms may be hard on the ego, they definitely made me more appreciative and accepting of my blessings in life.   Instead of having hatred and anger from what I saw as all the wrongs in the world, instead, I had acceptance and love and nothing else to give, even to the people I despised the most.  \r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that all these experiences in life, whether pleasant or painful, were all just experiences, nothing is necessarily right or wrong.  Good and evil is something we all need in order for our spirit to grow.  In that sense we desperately need other people, and we especially need the people we hate, fear, despise and compete against in order for us to fulfill our personal aspirations.  When Terence talks about the end of history, he means the end of the ego\x92s aspirations.  Because without self-wanting and self-satisfaction the wheels of history could not begin turning.  But without the wheels of history turning into full gear with the onset of culture and civilization we would not be in the position we are in today.  There was a trade off, a sacrifice that comes with civilization.  Similar to what Freud talks about in his book, Civilization and its Discontents. \r\n\r\nThis view of reality allowed me to live my life with a much more flexible attitude.  While I still furiously pursue my goals and I vehemently disagree with many people. I pursue life with an ironic lens, where behind all my actions, rests the awareness of a deeper appreciation of reality.  \r\n\r\nIt is amazing how great of a psychoanalytic tool the mushroom can be.  All the tension that seems to build in the mind can finally be resolved.  In many respects the visuals were the least interesting part of my trip.  Rather the ability to think deeply and critically, allowing for massive strides in personal growth to take place was the most fascinating part. the ability to think deeply and critically, allowing for massive strides in personal growth to take place was the most fascinating part. But it all really depends on one\'s own intention.  I went into the trip with intention of having a personal psychoanalytical look at myself and that is what I got.  I don\x92t think I would recommend psychedelics to anyone who hasn\x92t understood its spiritual purpose.  \r\n\r\nA good set and setting is crucial but most importantly having the awareness that this experience is not an abstraction but that the trip, physically and mentally, occurs in one\'s own consciousness.  I can\x92t stress this enough.  Way too often people think of the trip as something that will be experienced outside of them, in the sense of the physical world becoming distorted, which it most definitely does, but the distortion also happens to you!  To your ego! To your consciousness! And when that happens the trip becomes so bizarre that people will often feel overwhelmed.  But if you can become aware of this, through the acquisition of knowledge from others, it will allow you to ameliorate the potentials of a bad trip.  \r\n\r\nA proverb that sums up the previous paragraph: A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.  \r\n\r\nI would eventually come down, as we all must.  Overall, all four of us had a great trip.  The visuals were particularly intense with these mushrooms.  I have done mushrooms two more times, while both were intense, the visuals were much weaker and no ego death occurred. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to future trips and future reports. Cheers!"
75387,Death and Brain Decay,Bancopuma,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nRecently I had one of my deepest experiences with the mushroom.\r\n\r\nTwo close friends and myself had each ingested 3.5g of dried Liberty caps, Psilocye semilanceata. This would equate to a few hundred individual mushrooms, and was no doubt a high dose, and definitely one of the most intense mushrooms sessions I have every experienced. I have a special place for Liberty caps. They are small, but very potent, and they are our own indigenous psychedelic mushroom, harvested from the wild just a few miles away.\r\n\r\nI consider mushrooms my number one ally, on a level of their own beyond that of any other plant and drug, the mushroom has always clicked with me in a very special way. The more I\x92ve used them, the more respect I have for them, and to this end myself and my friends have begun to incorporate ritualised, Mazatec shamanic elements into our mushroom sessions. We lit a pure beeswax candle while preparing and ingesting our doses, and then blew Copal incense smoke over the mushrooms and ourselves before the start of the ceremony. This was the first time I have used such ceremonial methods, and from my experience it seems very beneficial to approach mushrooms in this way, as sacred plant teachers.\r\n\r\nThe experience took place in the living room of my friends and was a beautiful tripping environment, with old beams, many plants, cool artwork, and comfy sofas for curling up on. Once effects began to manifest we retired to the sofas and let the mushroom spread its liquid tendrils through our brains.\r\n\r\nI started to yawn a lot, and feel at peace, no euphoria as such, just a calmness that would reside with me for the rest of the trip. My friend remarked, just as I was thinking it, just how much like DMT visuals the first mushroom trips were, exquisitely detailed down to what seemed like a molecular level.\r\n\r\nAs the mushroom realm enveloped each of us, we became introverted and didn\x92t talk to one another for a few hours. My trip continued to deepen. I spent most of my time huddled up with my eyes closed, enraptured with thoughts and visions. Even a little light seemed to bright, so I kept my eyes closed. My thoughts drifted onto some of my current demons and faults, and my direction at university, and made me examine them in detail, as I suspected would happen before the ceremony. My friend vocalised, which had an amazing, expanding effect on my trip behind closed eye lids I highly recommend people experiment with vocalising while on psychedelics \x96 in particular mushrooms and DMT/ayahuasca. Simply experiment with droning noises by using your mouth to imitate a didgeridoo, and then incorporate any sounds you can make to see how it deepens and rives to visions. The effect is nothing short of profound.\r\n\r\nThere was no joy in this particular experience, the cosmic joy and bliss was simply not present. Post trip I would learn my friend was in a similar mind state, and spent some time on his own examining his issues in more detail, rather than shying away from them.\r\n\r\nA few hours into the trip, I underwent the most intense part of the experience by far. It came quite suddenly, without any prior thought. In this experience I felt like I was actually dieing. Now, I know mushrooms are incredibly safe, and death from direct toxic effects is simply not known. Yet, under the influence of the mushroom, they took me through what I really feel death to be like. It almost felt like a physical presence, like a shadow had descended and enveloped me, reminding me somewhat of a prior unusual homebrewed ayahuasca experience.\r\n\r\nI felt death in my brain. My consciousness, level by level, started to decay and shut down. I have no doubt in my mind that this is what the actual process of the brain death feels like. And yet with the intensity of the experience, feeling parts of my brain decaying and shutting down, I was completely calm. The experience was out of my hands, being driven by a power outside of myself, or my control.\r\n\r\nI must say that during the entire experience, I was in a realm of the most beautiful, other worldly visions, and yet these didn\x92t really seem important compared to the message and thought component the mushrooms were producing, the visuals seemed more like part of the d\xe9cor of the experience.\r\n\r\nIts hard for me to estimate how long this utterly bizarre state of purgatory lasted for, but it was for quite a while. Not long after this, myself and my friends started to drift back to reality. I had a glass of water, which struck me as pure, divine ambrosia; my enjoyment of the glass of water was ineffable. I had an insight into meditation, and being completely in the hear and now, and that\x92s what it felt like.\r\n\r\nOn the return to normal consciousness, we had a chat about our experiences. I was surprised to learn that my friend had also had a trip heavily focussed on death; he was more exploring the questions around it, while I seemed to actually undergo some of the stages of it. He describes feeling down, and wanting some alone time, never having experienced a \x91bad trip\x92 \x96 which we both agree is a very shallow, two-dimensional way of describing such an experience. However, he did not shy away from some of the darker aspects the mushroom was confronting him with regarding death, and a result all of us experiencing a very rewarding, fulfilling session. I felt invincible, and that many doors of possibility had been opened. We shared a few joints of organic, home grown \x91Silver Pearl\x92 marijuana, which was delicious, and discussed some of our experiences and insights of the proceeding few hours, to close the session,.\r\n\r\nPsychedelics have taught me to be less in fear of death before this day, but this experience has made me try and lose this fear altogether, as well as almost all other fear. Fear is such a powerful emotion that controls a lot of our time alive, and yet it is just a feeling, and we can choose not to feel it. One time out of ten fear may be an ally, keeping you out of harms way, but all the rest of the time it severely limits us and controls us. Living without fear is the path to freedom.\r\n\r\nIt has been three days since the experience and I am still feeling very positive, and the importance of what occurred a few nights ago has remained with me. My respect for mushrooms has increased further. The whole experience was an incredible therapy session. The mushroom is like an ancient and wise therapist that is willing to sit down and work on whatever problems I have personally. Even if I\'m not sure exactly what those problems are, the mushroom will find them and show me. Mushrooms are a spiritual mirror."
64129,Unexpected Intensity,Shroomer,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nWell I\x92ve tripped twice on shrooms before, about a year prior to this experience.  Both times I did about 1.7g of cubensis.  My friend T bought 28 grams of shrooms, and I decided that I had a perfect opportunity to take advantage of them-my mother and sister were out of town, and my father and brother were gone most of the next day.  So I bought 3.5 grams of shrooms, of the species semilanceata.\n\nI decided that I would do all 3.5g because I would not have to deal with my family.  I woke up at 8 AM on sunday and proceeded to eat the whole bag.  I heard a rumor that ascorbic acid in orange juice enhances the visuals, but we didn\'t have any.  I decided I would run out the store to get some before the shrooms took effect.  I ate them on an empty stomach, so I figured I would have about 30 minutes before I had to be back home and out of the car.  I went to the store and bought the orange juice but the cashier was extremely slow.  By the time I left the store I could notice that the parking lot was just a little different, and felt anxious and antsy.   [Erowid Note: \nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]  \n\nT+ 30: Return home, lock all the doors, drink the orange juice.  Grab Ipod and listen to music. Go upstairs and sit on the computer for a little while.\n\nT+ 50: I look over to my wall, which is covered in glow in the dark wallpaper. I notice a sense of 3-d in the wallpaper, and smile and giggle, happy that the trip is going well.  I head across the hall to the bathroom and have to pee. I look at myself in the mirror and see my dialated pupils and smile.  I feel the \'shroom\' gravity make it feel weird to walk.  For some reason I think the person in the mirror isn\'t really me.\n\nT+ 1 hours:  I go downstairs and sit in the chair, listening to 311. I am coming up really quick, due to not eating anything else.  I much on a few crackers and then cover up.  My ceiling starts to swirl and flow.  Borders around pictures and the tv are extremely pronounced.  \n\nT: 70 min:  I go outside on the deck and sit down.  The music I\x92m listening to affects my vision.  The grass in the backyard turns teal and reminds me of a disco floor.  It turns into fur and starts \'dancing\' to the music.  I am giggling and having profound realizations.  I go through the typical - \'I am one with nature,\' \'Shrooms let you see the world as it really is,\' etc.  I feel like I am holy and shrooms are holy and everything is right.\n\nT: 85 min:  This is where the trip goes south.  I didn\'t remember that I set my phone on the stand next to my chair.  I am slowly losing reasoning and critical thinking.  The vast amount of sensory information is flooding my brain, distracting me, and crossing over.  I go upstairs again and go into the bathroom.  This is one of the most memorable moments of my trip.\n\nI take off my headphones and put music on through my computer speakers.  I walk to the bathroom and the music sounds like it is coming from a different world... far far away. In the bathroom everything is in slow motion.  The walls are white and blue at the same time.  I have a full size mirror in the bathroom.  I go to move and see myself moving extremely slow.  The music slows down to match me.  This is so fun I think.  I go to the bathroom again and go back to my room.  I look at myself and think, I am not really this person in the mirror. I think I look like a frog. \n\nI sit and think in my room, and realize that I am having a very difficult time thinking logically.  I think, what happens if my parents call me?  There is no way in hell I can sound normal.  I get afraid that they will drug test me for weed, which I smoked the previous day.  I try to talk myself out of this, saying don\x92t worry, you\'ll be fine.  My reasoning mind cannot overpower my intense fear.  I feel schizophrenic.  Soon I realize that I am spirialing into a bad trip and try to stop it.  I hold it back for a few minutes, and go back to the bathroom.\n\nT + 90:  I grow considerably more afraid.  I am not afraid of what I see or feel, but I am afraid that I cannot control myself.  I knew before and my reasoning mind knew this was ok, but it wasn\'t enough.  I go back to the bathroom I say to myself \'stay in control, stay in control, its ok, its ok.\'  The fear grows too intense and I get one thought off \'HELP!\'  I wake up a few seconds later on the bathroom floor.  Apparantly I totally left reality and fell down.  This is what I told myself: \'OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, We are going to reason through this, talk through this, lets talk, talk, I\x92m gonna go into my ball, my safe place, my happy place, and think what to do.\'  And then I guess my physical body disconnected from my mind and I collapse.\n\nEven though this was scary, it was my first loss of contact with reality and I sort of miss and love it.  Then I look in my pockets\' my phone isn\'t there.  This makes me so afraid and alone.  I feel so scared that I can\'t contact anyone.  I start screaming out loud \'I just want my phone! Just give me my phone! you can do whatever else but give me my phone!\'  I run back and forth between the bathroom and my room looking for it.  After a while I realize maybe it could be downstairs.  I go downstairs and find it and I am so happy.  I come to the realization my phone is a symbol of security to me.  It is my connection to the world.  \n\nT+ 90:  I sit back down and try my best to think.  I decide that it\x92s not safe in my house and that I will get caught by my parents, even though I know there is no way for them to be home.  I decide I must leave my house by 3 PM to be safe.  I am still coming up and this scares the hell out of me.  My walls and ceiling are shaking and my house looks like its going to explode.  I totally give up on my own reason and try to figure out what to do.\n\nAfter a while I remember my friends parents are out of town, and I decide I have to go over to his house.  It takes me forever to go through the steps of leaving my house and making sure everything is ok.  My house is a symbol of safety as well, since I know I\x92m safe in it.  I finally get my shoes on and decide to leave. \n\nt+100: The world is nothing like I remember it. I feel like I\x92m on a foreign world. The clouds are like skyscrapers.  I\x92m walking down the road, staring at my feet, since I feel like my body is a lava lamp.  I call my friend and he doesn\'t answer.  I call his brother and he answers.  I tell him I\x92m coming over.  He says OK.  Then I get afraid that I forgot to lock my doors: I can\'t remember.  I turn around, but then get too afraid and turn around again.  Cars are flying past me and I don\'t even think about them.  I keep saying to myself out loud \'Its good, we\'re Good.\'  I call my dealer, get his voicemail and tell him to call me back.  \n\nt + 110:  I feel so scared and alone walking down the street.  I realize I must talk to someone in order to function.  I call my friend who was sleeping, and realize that there is no reason for me to talk to him.  I tell him what I ate and he says he is going back to bed.  I realize that he doesn\'t really care about what\'s happening to me.  I call my other friend call him \'Al\' and tell him that I ate an eighth of shrooms and I am having a really bad trip and I need his help.  He says he is gonna take his dog out and then talk.  I get so antsy, like I will never make it to his house.  I ask him if he can pick me up.  \n\nt+ 120: I am so afraid. I feel like I have no control over myself and I really don\'t.  I can\'t think.  My friend tries to talk to me and it sort of helps.  About the longest 5 minutes of my life pass, and he finds me and takes me to his house.  I tell him that we need to come up with a plan if my mom calls.  Apparantly this is a big deal, and I don\'t think that I can just not answer it.  I think about telling her the truth and that she will understand because shrooms are so holy.  Then I realize this will never work. \n\nWe get to my friends house, and I feel a little better. I realize that there are 3 things affecting how afraid I am: The sun, my friend, and my nausea.  When the sun goes away, I got scared.  When my friend left the room, I got scared as well.  And I felt so sick.  I just want the trip to end, I think that I will never do drugs again, and I am afraid I\'ll be like this for too long and my parents will notice.  \n\nt+140: I sit outside, and the realize that walking helps me think. I start walking in circles and try to talk to my friend.  He tries talking to me to calm me down.  His brother also comes out and talks.  I feel like they have no idea what I am going through.  But then again I don\'t want to freak them out either so I try to act as sober as possible.  \n\nI\'m caught in a dilemma-I want to be able to act sober because I have this fear I will need to face my parents any minute, and I also want to act as high as possible so my friends know what I\x92m going through.  I alternate between these feelings every second and I hate how I can\'t feel just one thing at a time.  \n\nFor basically the next two hours I go off and on between enjoying the trip and hating it.  I walked back and forth on the sidewalk for a while listening to music and trying to think of the lyrics, but I can\'t remember any.  The clouds are morphing, the steps become slopes, my friends eyes are glowing.  The trees are waving to me and the sky is indescribable.  When I start feeling nauseous again I get scared again, and try to drink water to help it pass.  I realize that my body is not me, and I am a separate entity.  I try eating some stuff, but it really doesn\'t help.  I go to the bathroom again, and in the mirror I turn into a skeleton and a frog and I hate the person in the mirror which isn\'t me.  The decorations in the room keep flying off the walls at me.  \n\nMy friend is an abstract artist, and I enjoy looking at his paintings. They are amazing.  They are moving and shifting and changing before my eyes.  Everything I look at melts into something else.  In the mirror a see myself pop in and out of existence. and I see what I perceive to be hindu gods.  I close my eyes and put on fast music, and I just dance and feel ecstatic.  I see blue balls of energy and feel like I\x92m falling. The whole time I want the trip to end.  My dealer texts me and I ask him how long it will last, even though I know myself and don\'t need his reassurance.  It makes me feel better though.  \n\nt+ 180:  I calm down a bit, my breathing gets a little better.  I\x92m still tripping balls.  I think that if I sleep it will go away, but I try and can\'t get anywhere.  My friends\' paintings stare at me.  We watch TV and the eyes of the characters glow.  Candles shrink and grow, and the carpet turns into grass.  My legs feel like one, and I interlock my fingers and it feels like one hand.  I still feel nauseous and want it to end.  I lie down on the caught and watch my feet and hands shrink to baby size and back.  I watch my skin crawl, but it doesn\'t bother me, because I know that it\x92s just the drug.  I am starting to come down, and now I am enjoying the trip.  I feel like every minute is an advance to reality and that makes me happy. \n\nt+240:  I am mostly down, things are still shifting and weird. The world just looks really weird, and now that I can think straight, I am happy.  I wish I could think normally and trip intensely, but I know that is not possible.  I realize that I hated and loved the trip at the same time.  I am starving, and my friends and I go to eat.  For the next few hours I feel a little weird, and things seem a little weird, but I am basically back to reality.\n\nLater I realized that I took a pretty potent species of mushroom.  The trip was just too intense for me, I felt out of control and this put me into a bad trip.  I realize now that even though I said I wouldn\'t do drugs anymore, I feel good about my trip.  I probably will try another 3.5 again, but probably not alone, and I will also have to convince myself that there is no way I can get caught, because that was my biggest fear.  \n\nMaybe next time I will remember how I got through this one and I will be OK."
67169,Feeling Death,Myka,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nFirst off I have extreme anxiety and I am bipolar. About a week ago I lost my anxiety medicine, but haven\x92t been in any particularly anxious situations and so I was coping alright. I also want to say that in the past, I loved liberty caps. I always had fun on them before and was really looking forward to this trip as much as the past ones. I feel though that we did not take some proper preparations and that perhaps I should\x92ve respected my drug a bit more. Here\x92s the story.\r\n\r\nMy good friends had a quarter of liberty caps on hold for them, but realized that they didn\x92t have the money for them, and so offered them to us. My fianc\xe9, my roommate K and I all decided that Friday would be the perfect night as our other roommate, who only smokes weed, would be there to be our sitter.  We had done shrooms three times before, and would be taking a smaller dose this time than usual as our friends had only set aside a quarter and the three of us would have to split it up. We each took about 2.3 grams.\r\n\r\nLooking back now I realize two things that caused this to be a bad trip. 1) I was worried that I would not trip since this was a smaller amount then I was used to and therefore 2) I didn\x92t eat anything that night, hoping that would intensify the trip. I also smoked a bowl before eating them hoping for the same thing. \r\n\r\nAfter eating the shrooms we sat in the living room with the TV on, slowly feeling the effects build up. Within 45 minutes from eating them the TV became far too overwhelming and we all headed upstairs to K\x92s room. I crawled in his bed and asked my fianc\xe9 to lay down with me. But I felt all wrong. I was having trouble breathing, I felt light headed and nauseous, and extremely cold. As I tripped harder and harder the tapestry that K had attached to his ceiling to dim the lights started taking on the frightening shape of alien faces. As I am extremely afraid of Aliens this was the worst possible thing that could happen. Suddenly everything was made up of alien faces. They were swirling around me all staring at me with their big eyes. \r\n\r\nI sat bolt up right in the bed and said, \x93I am going to throw up I need you to come with me.\x94 My fianc\xe9 could tell I was not having a good time and followed me. I sat shivering in the bathroom wishing I would just throw up but I couldn\x92t. The only thing in my stomach were the shrooms; so even when I did gag, that was all that would happen. I was determined not to go back in the alien room. And so I suggested we go down stairs. K followed us and put a pizza in the oven thinking we were all cold because of our empty stomachs. It seemed like just one second and the pizza was done and they handed me a piece. I felt afraid of everything, even this innocent piece of pizza and therefore was only able to eat a couple bites.\r\n\r\nI continued to get colder until I was shaking and felt like I was definitely going to be sick. I kept thinking that I had stopped breathing and would try and catch my breath, but I was just having so much trouble. I got up and dashed across the room to the bathroom. I sat on the bathroom floor and shook uncontrollably. I somehow confused myself into thinking that I had eaten the wrong shrooms and had therefore poisoned myself and I was dying, a thought put I my head because of all the research I had been doing recently on amanita\x92s which we had just received in the mail that same day. I asked for my Searaquill hoping that I could take one and fall asleep, but then thought, because I was so terrified, \x93I am dying anyway, I should take all of them and just finish this now.\x94 My fianc\xe9 did not hand me my Searaquill as he knew I would fall asleep and \x93miss the trip.\x94 Looking back now I very glad he did not give me my pills.\r\n\r\nHe came to the bathroom and helped me up and hugged me. I nearly passed out in his arms twice before I was able to say \x93let\x92s go to the bedroom.\x94 The second we were in the bedroom I took off my clothes and got under the covers. I was getting colder and colder. And I couldn\x92t stop shaking and wiggling. My fianc\xe9 held me for what seemed like an eternity. He said that every few seconds I would say \x93Baby I\x92m not ok, I can\x92t breath, I\x92m dying, call the hospital.\x94 Eventually I stopped adding the \x93Call the hospital\x94 and just decided that I was going to die, and if I was going to die, in my own bed being held by the man I loved was exactly where I wanted to be. So I resigned myself to never coming out of the trip and just layed down to die. \r\n\r\nWhat seemed like decades later, but was merely just a few hours, I felt better. It was like all of a sudden the shrooms lifted and I was all smiles. I had lived! I couldn\x92t believe it. I felt on top of the world for a few hours and then went to bed. The next day I woke up feeling kind of off. And that night I got cold and I freaked out. I thought I was dying again instantly. I insisted we go to bed again and he held me while I shook for the second night in a row, only this time there were no drugs involved. I even made him take my temperature. My anxiety had taken over and I had no more anxiety medicine.\r\n\r\nI am a pagan and have strong beliefs that always made death seem like a natural thing. For the first time in my life I am afraid of death. I feel like I know what it\x92s like to die and it\x92s scary as F***. 3 days later I am still a nervous wreck and I can\x92t help but think about death. I learned that shrooms may not be for me. I will now be the \x93permanent sitter\x94 for our house and stick to weed and pharmaceuticals."
66614,Journey To The Centre Of My Head,DayTripper,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nOur decision to do a trip that day was a spontaneous one. It was near the beginning of the shroom season for where I live, for some reason they don\'t seem to grow until mid-October around here, and prior to this experience we had only managed to find about 10 liberty caps each time, so we had only had pretty mild individual trips since last year\'s season.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I checked our best known shroom field (a racecourse) expecting to come away with few, if any, mushrooms. For the first ten minutes, as expected, I found nothing. Then I found shroom heaven, about 30 clusters of shrooms, all close together so that they formed one giant cluster of well over 200 liberty caps. I went into a picking frenzy, but was still careful not to uproot the shrooms and I left about half the shrooms I found to let them grow for next time. With my unexpected psychedelic bounty, I went to a friend\'s house to start tripping.\r\n\r\nWe decided to eat the shrooms, then go on a mission across some fields on a path by the river, a mission we had done before on mushrooms and had a great experience. We divided the mushrooms (about 70 for me, 50 for my mate), ate them fresh, grabbed our skateboards for some reason and set off on our quest.\r\n\r\nThey began affecting us quicker than normal, probably because it took so long to eat them, the first shrooms we ate would have been starting to work. The trip came on hard and fast. Within minutes the world had become a very surreal place. The sun was brighter than it had been, sounds were enhanced (but not distorted) and colours were much more pronounced. And I was getting freaked out by blades of grass.\r\n\r\nMy mate had been investigating a tree but when he came back over I grimly informed him of the grass\x92s plans to kill us. He said he was aware of their plans and that we should move on. I went down to the river and tripped out on the ripples, which seemed to be forming and endless spiral across the water, which now looked more like a mirror. We contemplated walking across this mirror to the other side, but then decided that it would probably trick us by turning out to be water after all. We moved on.\r\n\r\nAs we walked we encountered several dog walkers and joggers. At the start of the trip we had intended to freak out as many random people as we could, and I am pretty sure that\x92s exactly what we did, though I remember none of what we said or did to them. God only knows what they were thinking, and I doubt even God cares. \x93With a bit of luck, their lives were ruined forever.\x94\r\n \r\nWe passed a building on our journey, an old water tower (or something) which has been graffiti\x92d by some strange people. One of the pictures is of sort-of Liberty Cap shaped shrooms, with spots, and LSD written around it. Someone needs to get their drug facts right before they start spraying stuff that makes them look stupid. Anyways, one side of this building was made up of large sandstone bricks which stuck out unevenly. On shrooms, this was extremely trippy. My friend pointed it out to me, and then I couldn\x92t stop watching the bricks switch around, change size and move in and out of the wall. I dragged myself away knowing that there were trippier things further on. \r\n\r\nWe finally reached our destination, a dual carriageway that goes over the river. Underneath it is a very peaceful place we had discovered 2 years previously on shrooms, and named the Temple.  We tripped out on some strange graffiti people had written there over the years, including a weird poem, something like, \x93In the age of knights and armour, there lived a hairy llama\x94.  We sat on a stone bank going down into the river and chilled out for a while, seeing the other side of the river and the underside of the bridge form some kind of god\x92s face.  Eventually we got worried about the safety of the place as our shroomed minds were convinced the bridge was about to collapse. We moved on to a tunnel that runs through the ground underneath the dual carriageway not far from where we were. That was where we spent the next 200 years of our lives, or so it seemed. \r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this world that can possibly be trippier than that tunnel on shrooms. The ground is made of uneven, rippled and cracked concrete, covered with all sorts of multicoloured grime, and the walls are even worse. There were all sorts of patterns and images forming out of the slime and pockmarks on the wall. The trippiest thing was, the wall was made out of wood and concrete at the same time. This completely baffled us. We spent what seemed like a very, very long time contemplating what it was and what it could mean. When we touched the wall, it was definitely concrete. When we looked at some parts of the wall, it was definitely concrete. When we looked closely and around the edges, we noticed the wood pattern and splinters around the edge.  We eventually decided that the only thing it could be was wood with a thin layer of concrete over it, and carried on with our trip.\r\n\r\nWe spent about half the time trying to communicate with bizarre creatures that were forming on the walls, and the rest of the time we were discussing things and discovering secrets locked in our brain which the shrooms had released, as always, none of which I can remember, I just remember it happened. We also noticed that if we looked out of one side of the tunnel, it appeared to be nice, summery weather, but when wel ooked out the other side, it appeared to be winter: the trees were dead, the plants looked browner and the light was completely different. This was very confusing but definitely seemed real.\r\n\r\nWe tried to do some skating in there, but the surface was crap and the shrooms made everything difficult to do, I couldn\x92t even pull off an ollie. I attempted some Bert slides, which didn\x92t go spectacularly well and left me covered in mud and God knows what else, but it was a very trippy thing to do on shrooms.  After what seemed like four eternities, we attempted to leave, out of the summery side of course. I say attempted because we were waylaid by some new trippy things on the wall which we discovered, including numbers counting up from 27 written all over the tunnel walls. We tried to find all the numbers, thinking that this would result in some reward, possibly enlightenment. Eventually we gave up and tried to leave again.\r\n\r\nThis time we were halted in our tracks by some weird green slimy thing my mate had discovered in a massive puddle at the entrance. We couldn\'t figure out what it was, until he dropped the slime in some sunlight. \x93It\x92s a mouldy sock!\x94 I said. He insisted that it wasn\x92t a sock, but I was convinced it was. It appeared to be made from the same material as a sock when I studied it closely. Then I looked closer at the puddle. It was half covered in the same \x93material.\x94 It couldn\x92t be a sock after all, so what the hell was it? We finally managed to escape this tunnel by splashing around through a swamp which we must have gone through to get in, but we were sure it hadn\x92t been there, and it wasn\x92t raining or anything.\r\n\r\nWe emerged from the tunnel into a completely different world. Decades, maybe centuries seemed to have passed. All the plants seemed about three times as tall as they had been when we fought our way through to get there, and the cars speeding over the bridge looked futuristic. One thing that was the same was a truck that had been parked in a lay-by about a hundred yards along the dual carriageway. We could only see the top of it over the enbankment and now it looked like a huge monster hiding amongst the greenery, ready to pounce. We fought our way through the tall and thorny plants, wondering what the new world was going to be like, and how we had survived in the tunnel for so long. We decided it must be at least 50 years in the future, and we headed back to town to see what it was like.\r\n\r\nOn the way we were sidetracked by the discovery of an incredible shroom field. We had always thought that they should grow along that route but had never found them. The grass was quite long, but amongst them we couldn\x92t stop finding shrooms. We only picked about 10-15 each because we didn\x92t need them that day and we wanted to leave them for another time.  Plus it was starting to go dark. The journey back was even more insane than the journey there. The darkness strengthened the trip, and then the mist came in. We encountered a few more people, and I definitely remember saying strange things to them, but I still can\x92t remember what we actually said. \r\n\r\nAbout halfway back along the trail, we realised we were in Vietnam and being hunted by US troops and Vietcong, as we were just a couple of tripping guys that had suddenly been transported to the middle of a warzone. We grasped our skateboards as weapons and carried on up the trail, careful to avoid punji stake pits and grenade trip wires. As we neared the end of our journey we received a phone call from some mates who were not tripping, but had a bunch of shrooms and wanted us to come round and give them the few we had.\r\n\r\nOne of them, an annoying little pill-munching cokehead who we had attempted to raise from schoolboy-ness into the ways of ganja, shrooms and righteousness but had fucked that all off for chemical class A\x92s and had a delusion of being a big time dealer, completely ruined our trip with his unneccessary whinging about how 70 wasn\x92t nearly enough, after the experience we were having on 70 and 50, this fucked with our heads and pissed us off. He also kicked off for no reason when we suggested that they come out to meet us so we could all trip outdoors. We decided that if he was there, being like that then we was no way we were going to meet them. This led to a very dark and depressing 45 minutes of wandering the streets, tripping, trying to squeeze some kind of plan through the psilocybin in our brains.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we rescued the night by going back to my mate\x92s house to end the trip where it had started. We smoked a joint and watched Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and during this the trip faded away. Soon after the film I departed to return home. Walking through town the trip reactivated and the streets suddenly became very strange. I started to think a nuclear war or plague or some apocalptic thing had happened while were in the tunnel. I actually enjoyed this experience because deep down I knew that wasn\x92t really true, but there was enough psilocybin and psilocin left in my brain to create that reality on one level of thought. On the bus home the trip faded again, leaving nothing more than bright colours and trippy patterns over my vision.\r\nWhen I got home, I watched TV, smoked some more weed and finally fell into some weird and very interesting dreams."
45640,Faith,Slash,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI\'ve always been a fan of psychedelics. Over the years I\x92ve come to believe that the scope for insight and self-improvement whilst under the influence of the aforementioned is not only priceless and unparalleled, but also divine and sacred. You may say I\x92m a dreamer, but I\x92m not the only one. My first forays into the realms of expanded consciousness were typical. Marijuana, then ecstasy and lsd, gave me happy, euphoric experiences that re-affirmed my faith in life itself.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager, with all the accompanying hormonal and emotional handicaps, I was not happy. Being a relatively ugly person (in my own eyes) and going through the aggravation of my parent\'s divorce and subsequent dual domestic life, left me drained, depressed and sad. This all happened at about the age of eleven. Whilst my parent\'s tried to retain a mature and dignified approach to the situation, I was not receiving the love an attention any adolescent requires. I hated life. I wanted to escape. So, I got high.\r\n\r\nCannabis was a revelation. So little effort was required to produce such profound effect. On my first time, I had three tokes from a red-seal laced bong. I soared. I must have laughed for half an hour straight, just at the fact I couldn\'t believe what I had been missing out on all this time. Every sense was amplified, and distorted. I was hysterical and hyperactive, but, above all, I was happy. I ended up having an excessive habit for seven years.\r\n\r\nDuring this period I experimented with ecstasy, then lsd. Ecstasy was exactly that. Totally mind-blowing. Experiencing it with my closest friends we talked endlessly, with a profound and true connection between us all. We were able to compliment and criticise each other, without any awkwardness or ego. Pure understanding. Ecstasy taught me how to low let go of my ego, and how to have faith in myself. In so many social situations I used to say or do things in order to gain some kind of \'upper hand\', to boost my ego and social standing. Ecstasy completely obliterated all that bullshit. It taught me that it doesn\x92t matter what other people think of me, it\'s my own sense of self-worth that precedes contentment. The key to happiness is by doing what I want to do, for my own reasons.       \r\n\r\nLsd was ridiculous. I\'ve always likened acid to someone grabbing me by the balls and twisting them - if they get it right, it\'s quite a thrill, but if they get it wrong it can cause serious pain. I\'ve had uncomfortable experiences with acid, but nothing I couldn\'t handle. The good parts of acid were phenomenal. Deeply spiritual, emotional times. I can recall one time when I was just staring at myself in a mirror, straight into my eyes, and I ended up crying because I just felt so unbelievably privileged to be alive and young. Experiences like that have changed my life for the better.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, the reason I have outlined these experiences is to illustrate the fact that my mindset has been dramatically altered by these illicit drugs, and it is from this altered state in which the experience I am about explain, took place:-\r\n\r\nWe really deserved our harvest. After roughly 20 hours of field work, we finally stumbled across a field brimming with liberty caps. They were everywhere. Two hours of frantic picking later we had approximately a kilo of fresh mushrooms. Hyperventilating and happy, we returned home and examined our bounty. We invited all our closest friends round. Shock and awe was the general reaction to the colossal pile of fungi we had amassed. There were seven of us in total. Obviously still reeling from the adrenaline rush of our find, I decided that we were going to do half of the mushrooms that night.\r\n\r\nWe gathered round the seething cauldron of mushrooms and boiling water. We laughed and joked about what could be in store, and watched the clear water turned into a deep, jet-black syrup. Once the brew had been prepared, each member of the establishment helped themselves to a generous portion. Less than ten minutes later the initial effects were apparent. I suddenly went weak at he knees and had to sit down. I started seeing shafts of luminous light spearing from all angles, and everything was drenched in a sparkling, iridescent coating. It was obvious that I was in for quite a ride.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later and we were in another dimension. We were confused and delirious. I felt as if I had no control over my limbs; they were flapping about like a branch in a gale as we laughed uncontrollably. Anything that anybody did seemed unbelievably hilarious and I also started to feel a profound connection with everybody else in the room. I seem to remember that when I was laughing it felt totally amazing, like a primeval release of energy. It felt purifying and energising. We were laughing so hard that it seemed to echo inside my chest. At that point I started to think about how natural and \x93right\x94 the whole situation was. I understood how for thousands of years humans had been undertaking the exact same ritual of picking mushrooms, getting high with their mates and having a fucking good time. I thought about the people walking the streets, walking past these mushrooms, knowing they were there, and that they were psychedelic, yet completely disregarding them out of sheer ignorance. Why the hell weren\x92t they getting them there selves? Don\x92t they want to feel like this? Coz it\x92s fucking brilliant! Fools!\r\n\r\nOnce they started to wear off somewhat, the trip became even more enjoyable. The sheer confusion and delirium of the earlier stages started to subside, to be replaced by a pure, comprehensive understanding of everything. That\x92s how it seemed anyway. Every question I could possibly imagine in my mind simply dissolved into the answer. That\x92s how clearly I believed I could see. I felt as If I could see in into the future \x96 not literally, but that I could make an accurate prediction of future events based on the knowledge of previous ones. My reality seemed to be the epitome of a perfection that I had created, if you get what I mean! Its difficult to explain. I embraced a lust for life I had never previously experienced and carry with me to this day. As we shared this collective experience between us, I had never ever felt so alive. It was breathtaking. I felt like a god.\r\n\r\nEventually they did wear off and I came back down to earth. As I said before though, the knowledge and wisdom that experience gave me is still with me and I have been a happier person ever since then. If there is one thing that I learned that night though, it is that there is only one thing we really need in this life \x96 faith. Also, I don\x92t think this experience would have been possible without the experiences I had already had with other drugs, as I outlined before. To me every experience (drug-related or not) \x93re-wires\x94 my consciousness to some extent and I did happen to be a very open-minded, understanding individual beforehand."
22350,The Lamp,Ethan Kurtz,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nJust when I had begun thinking that nothing much was going to happen, the pole light in the corner of the room began to waver.  The middle section between the base and light dome began to twist and coil like an irritable snake.  \'Maybe I shouldn\'t have eaten all of those mushrooms,\' a thought rolled over my brain like a news ticker at the bottom of the screen on a 24 hour news channel.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there was something before this wasn\'t there?\r\n\r\nI first became interested in the relationship between ethnogens-- particularly mushrooms-- and non-traditional spiritual experiences eight years ago.  Being a less than adventureous individual (read: coward), I was content for an extended period of time to pursue extensive research on the subject.  As Ralph Waldo Emmerson said, \'knowledge is the antidote for fear.\'  And the more I read concerning mushrooms the less intimidated I was by the thought of \'shrooming\'.\r\n\r\nI decided to embark on my first mushroom guided journey in the early morning hours of Thanksgiving 2002.  I had done very little in the way of packing for the trip prior to departing.  I got some art books (Caravaggio and Klimt) and put several Lorenna McKennitt CD\'s in the CD changer before eating the mushrooms.  This was at approximately midnight.  Onset effects were almost an hour in coming.  This was due probably largely to the fact that I had eaten only five hours beforehand.\r\n\r\nI first noticed an increased level of energy.  It became very difficult to hold still and I fidgeted constantly while looking at several of the paintings in the art books.  I quickly became uninterested in the paintings.  I smoked a cigarette and grew fascinated with the way it burned.  It seemed that when I watched it closely, it burned slowly.  When I turned away for only a moment, the cigarette would seem to be suddenly consumed while I was not watching.\r\n\r\nAt this point I felt the overwhelming urge to lie down.  I did so on the couch in my living room.  The couch cushions seemed to move under me.  I would breath out and the couch would rise under me.  If I inhaled the couch felt like it was sinking.  It seemed to me that the couch was breathing in time with me, with it\'s inhalation matching my exhaling.  It was a comforting feeling. I glanced up at one point to look around the room.  The love seat that matches the couch was in my line of vision and the dots that are part of the design on the upholstery seemed to move.  It was as if hundreds of lady bugs were crawling over the surface of the couch.  The couch seemed as if it possessed the ability to feel.  It seemed very sad.\r\n\r\nI passed out soon afterwards.  Actually, I am not sure \'passed out\' is the best way to put it.  It was as if I was instantly severed from any sort of external perception my body or self.  There was only a vast void.  I had no feeling except for a profound contentment. I came back to myself just as the last CD in the changer came to an end.  I opened my eyes.  Everything around me was strange and vaguely menacing.  The light in the room had changed.  It no longer looked like light.  It seemed to just be various shades of yellow painted on the walls, ceiling and furniture.  Shadows listed gently on the walls.  I sat up as I noticed that the shadows seemed to be walking off the walls out into the room.\r\n\r\nI blinked against this uncomfortable hallucination and as soon as my eyelids closed, it was as if a voice-- possibly my own-- whispered to me inside my head.  It said: \'Your cynicism and pessimism are a gift.  You are using them as a crutch and thereby alienating yourself from your own existence.\'  I opened my eyes and the shadows had receded and were again slithering around the walls.  I went to bed soon after this, but I was unable to sleep for quite some time. The voice I heard was not easy to shake.  I had been struggling with a great deal of issues in several important relationships in my life.  In the days after my experience, I felt a sort of clarity about my life.  I made several important decisions regarding my plans for the future which I had been avoiding for several years with ease.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly two months later, I took mushrooms again.  The set and setting with this trip were much more involved.  I cleaned my house.  I planned a time when I could be alone and undisturbed for an entire day.  I had a definite goal in mind for this trip, a question: what am I supposed to do with my life?  I was at a very difficult point in my life.  I was about to lose my job.  The plans I had set in motion after my last trip had been set in motion but would not be useful for a half year.\r\n\r\nI took 3.5 dry grams of Psilocybe Semilanceata.  I chewed each mushroom until it had almost entirely dissolved in my mouth before swallowing.  It took me a little over ten minutes to ingest the dose.  Onset effect began to manifest in less than twenty minutes.  Object in the room around me began to expand and contract.  The lamp mentioned at the beginning of this essay began it\'s snake-like behavior.\r\n\r\nA bright light filled the room around me.  It seemed like it was being emitted from a small sphere floating inches above the center of my head.  The light became almost blinding and then disappated, leaving a series of visual anamolies in its\' wake.  I saw visual anamolies because that is the easiest way to explain things.  It was like my field of vision had been fractured jigsaw puzzle style.  Each small piece of fit together to make up my everything I could see.  However, within the pieces the colors seemed to separate into three distinct layers.  blue receded, the green floated in the mid-ground, while red seemed to be the closest to me.  When I closed my eyes, a single buttercup like flower spun behind my eyelids.  They were a bright orange color and they looked like flowers except that instead of pollen markings they had hieroglyphic markings that changed in a counter clockwise manner as the flowers spun clockwise.\r\n\r\nI became very uncomfortable and could not hold still.  I began thinking that I had eaten too many mushrooms and that I was going to go insane.  I tried to eat something, thinking that since I had fasted for 16 hours prior to eating the mushrooms that putting some food in my stomach might diminish their effect.  Eating was an extremely difficult undertaking.  I was overly aware of each little movement of my jaw and teeth.  It took too long to chew.  I started to feel nauseous and gave up on eating.\r\n\r\nI laid down on the floor and tried to get comfortable.  I was cold, so I covered up with a loose weave blanket and stared up through the holes in it at the room, which was constantly warping and moving.  I found that by looking up through the blanket\'s weave, I could actually be somewhat comfortable.  If I stared long enough, I found myself feeling physically disjointed.  As if my body were inhabiting various areas of the room I was in.  My right arm was under me.  My head was floating above me near the roof, looking down on me.  My left arm and leg were somewhere near the front door.\r\n\r\nUpon closing my eyes, four identical fractal spirals began tracing their way out into a great black void.  If I concentrated hard enough I could actually ride on one of the four as it spun off into infinity.  The difficulty was that riding the spiral too long made me dizzy.  If I was in any one of these alternate realities for too long, I grew extremely uncomfortable.  I found that it was easiest to let myself not choose any one reality and to attempt to simultaneously exist in each reality for as long as I could.  At these moments when I inhabited all of my available bodies simultaneously, were the only moments when I felt the same euphoria of my previous experience.\r\n\r\nFinally, everything calmed a little.  My fractured vision continued for nearly five hours.  But at least after several hours I was able to move around again.  At this point my best friend called to check on me.  She had known I was tripping alone and wanted to make sure I was alright.  We talked for several minutes and she asked me if I had recieved any profound insights.  I tried to explain what I was experiencing.  Finding the correct words, however, was nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nI tried to sleep, after I got off the phone.  I was not able to and so I sat trying to ascertain why I was feeling the way I was feeling.  I was still hallucinating, but my fractured vision had subsided.  I began to hear music in my head.  It was Oakenfold-esque trance music.  I interested me initially but grew repetitive.  I thought that it would be nice if the song had a new sound added to it.  Instantly, the music in my head readjusted itself with the noise I had wished it to have.  I slowly realized that I could control the music.  It was like having turn tables in my head, where I could create my own soundtrack.  The idea crossed my mind that DJ\'s are really the last pure reporters on the planet.  They inhabit key central nodes in the world-- New York, London, L.A., Paris, Sydney, etc.  They take music, which is essentially distilled information and re-channel it in a new direction.\r\n\r\nAs I started to come down, I was overcome with an extreme since of lonliness.  It was not the typical fearful lonliness.  It was just a sense of singular purpose in the universe.  In the months since this experience, I have thought about it extensively.  I have several things about myself.  In my life, I tend to create self defeating loops for myself.  By this I mean that I attempt to manipulate sitations to my benefit, but I do it in such a way that it actually inadvertantly damages me.  I spend too much time blaming the effects in my life, without examining the causes.  Virtually all my decisions have been made to allow me to follow the path of least resistence.  This is not the way I wish to live my life."
45414,High Chapperall,Ferrelas,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, Cannabis, Tobacco & Datura","\nThe mushrooms in this report are 52 liberty caps (17/person).\r\n\r\nWhen F & I arrived at E\'s house he had a present for us. This turned out to be a joint with tobacco, cannabis and datura that we smoked together. When we had finished it F left and E and I talked some and got the idea that we should grind the mushrooms. However this didn\'t go very well as the shrooms mostly got flat and didn\'t turn into a powder at all. They were not dry enough I think since we picked them the day before. Now the joint had started to take effect and we were laughing alot at mostly anything, though extra at our shrooms.\r\n\r\nWhen F got back, he thinks that we should make tea from the shrooms instead and after some discussion we agree with him. So our beat up shrooms are put into a pot for boiling about a quarter or so. At this point E made dip and brought a bag of chips (crisps) that we later on had in the living room during all of the trip. After this we pour everything into a tea pot together with some tea supposed to taste \'gunsmoke and tar\'. When everything was done we added some extra spice to the tea, saved the shrooms, and added some honey to them. Then we ate the shrooms and poured our tea into mugs that we took into the living room for consumption. At this point the effects from the joint had dissipated completely.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the living room we put on an episode of \'High Chapparall\', a Swedish entertainment series were two comedians travel around the world and most often visit celebreties, and commence to drink the tea. The tea accualy tasted quite good and was easy to drink. When we were done with our first mug we poured the remaining tea and got about \xbd mug each. When this too was consumed we had only to wait for the effects to come on and keep watching the show. At this point I also started a timer to keep track of how long it had been since we ingested the tea.\r\n\r\nAfter approximately 15 mins F asks if anyone else is feeling anything yet. I get confused as to if it is yes or no and say something like: \'Yes... or no... the right answer in any case, the one you are supposed to say.\'. Then E says, \'Bracket \'right answer\' you mean.\' and I agree with him and we laugh at it. A while later I can feel something in my lung and I tell the other that I agree to feeling the effects.\r\n\r\nA while later I discover that I have alot of fun muscles in my face that are fun to play with and later on I also find it entertaining to move about arms and legs and this causes the others in the couch to wonder what I am doing, but I can\'t explain myself. I get enchanted by my cellphone and I think that it is totally fasinating to look at the timer and that it produces a cool effect when I move the cell towards and away from my face. Sometime around here the timer is stopped which is a bit sad but we managed anyway.\r\n\r\nNow things get going and I hear the song \'Jag g\xe5r och fiskar\' (this is a sing in Swedish about going fishing and having a break from the monotonous lives we all lead). I understand that we have \'gone fishing\'. About now the phone rings and we go to the kitchen to get it. I get to speak with the person at the other end and he tells me how to make crack, I tell him that we have gone fishing. When the episode of \'High Chapparall\' we were watching is over E puts some music on. It sounds very strange and funny, partly because it was strange music but it didn\'t sound as strange the day after.\r\n\r\nWe lay in the sofa listening to music, talking and laughing. We are still comming up. Now I get the idea that watching a movie might be a good idea. After a short while of confusion E finds \'Fritz the Cat\' and we watch at and have much fun doing so. Now E and I are quite high and laugh alot over mostly anything. We also have a hard time grasping that we are still comming up. In the middle of the movie E gets a strange idea and have to change film/music before it ends all of the time. Because of that we stop watching the movie and listen to music instead, which E changes all of the time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly E and then F disappear from the living room. I\'m going to find out where they went so I try to get out of the sofa. This proved to be no easy task and I mostly stumble around in the sofa falling over all of the time but after some time I manage to get down on the floor, but well there I couldn\'t remember how to stand up. After a somersault that almost ended in E\'s stereo I managed to remember how to do it properly. I found the others in the kitchen talking on the phone with the same person as before and I lay down on the floor next to the phone. I get the receiver and I\'m told to describe what\'s going on. I can only tell him that it is like cannabis but better, bigger and beyond that. When I lie there on the floor looking up onto the ceiling I can feel how reality \'shifts\' like it can do in optical illusions that have two pictures in one, and the floor becomes the ceiling and the ceiling becomes the floor. Now I lie on the \'ceiling\' looking up into the \'floor\', a very strange experience.\r\n\r\nNow we\'re going back to the living room and when I get there I throw myself forwards into the living room for some reason. Afterwards I can\'t believe I did or why it didn\'t hurt, but in the middle of the experience it was cool. I was sailing through the air and landed flat on my stomach sliding a few feet, and that was kinda cool at the moment. We listen to music for a while and then when E turns the tv off to put on an LP with Beethoven everything gets very strange, this was because of the fact that reality disappeared when the light from the tv went out. E starts shouting that we should turn on the light so that he can turn on the LP but F and I firmly state that we can\'t \'cause the reality is gone. After some searching F finds the lamp and says that it is warm and wet. I too find it but I think that it is cool and dry.\r\n\r\nAfter some fumbling we manage to get the light on and reality comes back. E turns on the LP rather quickly and starts searching for a part that we\'re going to listen to. I think that it sounds like he is \'zapping\', a verb that in Swedish means to change channels quickly searching for something to watch or just for fun when watching tv. I turn off the lights and E lays down on the floor. Me and F lie on the couch listening. After a while the PL comes to an end and E starts fiddeling with it. A scratching noise comes from the speakers. \'That\'s the way paper sounds\', E says. He asks if he has turned the LP over but no one really cares so he plays on. Then he proceeds to lie down. I realize that we are rather spoiled, since we can lie here in the living room, on shrooms, listening to a whole symphony orchestra. In the old days you had to go to a concert hall on shrooms if you wanted to listen to music then, and that was probably no easy task. After a while E stands up on his knees and starts waving his arms to the music, it looks funny.\r\n\r\nWe go to the kitchen and do something I don\'t really remember. Then I lie in front of E\'s fridge and he opens it and pours some milk on me, and that was the funniest thing that ever happened to me and I rolled around on the floor laughing. Then we went back to the living room. It was made apparent that E wanted to get us out of the kitchen because it was \'bad\' and he poured milk on me to drive me out of it, didn\'t really get the desired effect. E also comments that his dog doesn\'t dare to be on the ground floor any more.\r\n\r\nE goes to the bathroom and when he is done I get in there. At first I\'m not sure if it is the bathroom so I ask E and he says that it is and I see it too when he turns on the light. When I\'m sitting in the bathroom I find a comic book and in the begining of it there are some Russian. Having read some Russian I look a little extra at it and I realize that I accualy understand some of it. When I read on I get totally lost in the book and almost forget that there are a world outside it.\r\n\r\nWhen I\'m done I return to the living room where the others are and we conclude that the peak is over but there are still alot left. E tells us that he got visual distortions in the bathroom, the frame of the mirror was moving and it was very exiting to watch myself in the mirror. We watch \'High Chapparall\' again and it is the episode with Fabio. I bore into all of the pillows in the sofa and lie there having a good time for the duration of the episode. We talk about what a nice and decent human being Fabio seems to be. Sometime during the episode I noticed that the chips and dip that seemed infinite earlier has decreased a good deal but there is still alot left. I think that the trip feels the same way.\r\n\r\nWhen we\'re done watching tv I want to explore the kitchen during the comming down. We do that for a while and then F finds some small fire crackers that he lights inside. E takes the box from him and take them out to play some with them. I didn\'t like the idea but the others didn\'t listen. After a while E gets the great idea that we can light all of them at the same time. He snaps one of them on the middle, puts it among the fuses of the other fire crackers, light it and run. Then there were a big flame from the box and a second later there are detonating fire crackers flying in all directions. Then E goes into his fireworks storage that was pretty well filled and get some kind of torch that burned with a coloured flame. He let it burn for a while and then he\'s going to urinate in it. I suddenly get the idea that it is dangerous because it has sodium in it. I try to stop him but he ignores me. He then tried to shoot it away with a broom, at first he misses, proclaiming that he was just practicing but then he sucseedes. He then proceeds and throws the broom away.\r\n\r\nAfter this adventure we went back in and think that we should clean up and then make some food, which everyone thought sounded like a good idea. E turns on the light and say something about us having defiled his parents home. He takes out a vaccum cleaner and orders me to take out some dishes into the kithcen. I obey and in the kitchen F is washing a frying pan, something which I always think that he does when he is high. When I return to the living room to get more dishes I understand that it isn\'t over yet because when I enter E stands in front of a mirror and he is vaccuming his own face. Then I laugh alot and then E starts vaccuming my face too and I laugh like a maniac but then we straighten up and finish cleaning.\r\n\r\nThen E finds some food in the freezer and we decide to cook it. E puts some butter in the frying pan and then he just put the frozen food in too without waiting for the butter to melt. When he realizes his mistake he just tells us that it\'s supposed to be that way. We fried 6 eggs and E thought that they looked like pancakes and flipped them like you do a pancake. Though it was against better knowing the flipping succeded without any major accidents. Then we ate the food, but I was not that intressted in eating the food, though I was very thirsty so I downed 2 glasses of orange juice. I was very fascinated by the food. \'It\'s like small cubes of food you can build stuff with\', I think I said. At this time E discovered an SMS that said: \'Shrooms is life. I\'ve never felt this good.\'\r\n\r\nWhen we were done with the food we went to bed and watched a movie and fell asleep. I had wanted to have something to calm me down, preferably cannabis, when I was goig to sleep. The day after I was a bit tired but the was solved with a good nights sleep."
50299,My Surroundings,Viruk,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nTo Start off I\'m 18 and have only used marijuana before. I read a lot of trip reports to prepare myself. I packed my marijuana smoking gear, warm clothing, and drinks (cola and water). I\'ve been trying to get shrooms for weeks, everyone is always out, but today, a dealer I know comes up to me and says man I heard you want some shrooms. Naturally I said damn straight I want some shrooms. He picks out \'about 4-5 grams\' of liberty caps. I buy them for 40$ canadian. A few hours later I\'m heading with my buddy oz to another friends place. We get off the bus and he says \'Yo man, break out the shrooms already.\'  I whip em out and this is roughly 5:50ish I commence to start eating shrooms with oz, sharing about 2 grams with him.\r\n\r\nI get to my friend B\'s place and already a few people are there. I finish off the shrooms which taste very woody and dry at first, but with a bitter/sour aftertaste. Cola cures this aftertaste rather quickly. We sit in the kitchen after we finish, I get dizzy and nauseated. We head to my friends room, a small room with foam on the ground, posters on the wall and a yellow light. By this time 6:30 I\'m already starting to trip. Everythings pushing in on me, like the air got really heavy, and I\'m getting increasingly sick feeling.\r\n\r\nI decide this is already really edgy and I feel nervous, I need to smoke a bowl of weed to calm myself, so I do. Instantly it takes the edge off, but it also throws me into overgear making the trip stronger. I start rummaging through my backpack in search of pen and paper to write down everything I\'m starting to see. My buddy gives me a plank of wood to act as a surface to write on. I start writing and it seems the ink is really sticky, and just drags over the paper. I write down some illegible things and lose my train of thought blaming it on my friend. The plank of wood explodes, litterally taking over the entire room, then shrinking again. I whip out my favorite book and open it up. Letters fly everywhere, I shut that pandoras box ridiculously fast. I then think I may be cold so I pull my sweater towards me, it flows with my hand like oil, and I put it on. \r\n\r\nThen this kid goes \'Hey man you\'re bleeding all over the place man\' I wasn\'t he was just tripping me out and man was I scared, I realized I couldn\'t feel anything and that physical harm was a real fear. I start to go to the store with my friends, about 50 ft from the house I realize I\'m an idiot and run back to the house. I get back to the house and already everything\'s a little bit too crazy. I start to question everything, something I can\'t help but do for some reason. I become afraid and slightly paniced about the strength of this drug. Next thing I know I\'m lieing on the floor in the living room, its 7:12, I\'m so messed up that I forget what my body looks like. I hear shouting (people actually fighting in the house) and man that\'s a terrible thing to hear stoned.\r\n\r\nI look around and everything explodes into grains of sand, I\'m flying through this ridiculous duststorm and I can\'t focus or understand. I suddenly am back in the room, then I seem to melt and fly to another part of the room. I sit down, something is in my way, what are these ridiculous contraptions, what purpose do they serve, oh wait! It\'s my legs! All splayed out in front of me. I realize I have arms and hands to. I look at my palms and can see the blood running underneath the skin, I wonder if I were to slice myself with my knife what would happen, because obviously a mind such as this cannot die, I\'d live forever in this state, floating around without a body. Quickly I change my track of thought, before I get too many ideas.\r\n\r\nThe drug is proving impossible to control, I decide to go with it. I look at the carpet, one of those half shag ones with strings poking up. The rug starts growing and shrinking then flys around my head and I get sucked in again, flying through some other kind of kaleidoscope storm. I phase back into reality and get in touch with my body enough to realize I\'m going to vomit. I\'m afraid of vomiting because I\'m tripping so hard I can barely feel my body, I could choke and die but I walk to the bathroom and do vomit, luckily into the toilet. Sitting there staring into the toilet I get sucked back into madness everything for 5 mins is just a raging swirl into the toilet.\r\n\r\nI pull my mind away and miraculously figure out how to work the sink, my subconcious seems to be bored of my antics and is working on some sort of basic comfort instinct. I look into the mirror and think \'Wow you look sick, red eyes, sweating, sort of depressed looking.\' I run into my friends brother and claim \'I\'m never doing this again this is not my drug!\' He yells to his wife that I\'m having a bad trip and to make sure I don\'t do anything crazy. I look at him like he\'s stupid, then I\'m in the corner again.\r\n\r\nI lay down for another 15 mins and its around 8:00 now, I\'m shocked to see so little time has passed. I become aware of who I am and drink some water, then I sit down and start pieceing my mind back together. I start to see that talent and skill is just the ability people have to will themselves a universe, and that nothing is really there until you force it to be. I realize that people in life just try to show me how to better master my surroundings, and that we are all little balls of light floating around trying to understand everything. I gain more respect for schooling and teachers, only to lose it again when I\'m sober. I also grasp some concept that things I don\'t like are things that invade my mind, things that get to my mind. I like my surroundings and if someone ruins them I don\'t like that person for making me uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI stop my mad philosophical ranting and stare at the wall. The young children who live in the house have drawn lines with crayons of all sorts of color. I watch these lines and try to figure out what they really are, but they keep moving. They form roman soldiers marching to a town. They walk into the town and speak to someone. They then raise their swords and hack the person down and proceed to kill off the entire town. This was the most entertaining thing I have ever seen, my friends looked at me as I continued to look all over the wall watching this portrayal of history play out in front of me. I start to chat with a 6 year old girl who is awake and in the same room as me, we start playing with simple toys and arguing over the spelling of the word dog. I seemed to relate very well with this child.\r\n\r\nThe next 2 hours or so I am coming down and it\'s just a smooth ride of colors and patterns, and things moving. I enjoy the crazy rug, it\'s just, well crazy. I come back to reality and realize that shrooms are truely amazing. After I came down I shared my experience with J (B\'s sister) and G (B\'s brother in law). The whole trip went 0-40mins coming up. 40mins-2hours was the peak until I vomited. 2-5hours was coming down.\r\n\r\nLuckily the whole time I was freaking out at the peak of it a part of me was sitting there observing saying \'Don\'t worry you\'ll come down soon, is there any person that can speed up this come down? Your dad can he help? a doctor? No, only time can help you, time IS your friend, just wait, it may be hard but keep calm and keep safe\' This was ridiculously assuring, combined with the fact that this voice occasionally said \'Man you\'re an idiot for taking so much, dummy.\' or something to that effect, making the situation almost humerous. Things that didn\'t help were the constant screaming in the background and the fact that spongebob squarepants was on and in that episode the characters go mad and scream and shit, it was terrifying and made reality seem that much farther away."
33674,Ten Tears After,coco,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nAs its ten years after this experience, I thought its time I let it out, as strange things seem to be drawing me back to these experiences lately, but I won\'t go into that.\r\n\r\nI\'ve smoked cannabis daily for the last 15 years, and have found it to be a constant in my life. When I was in my teens, my interests in altered states led me to LSD, and at that age the only sources of info seemed to be 1960\'s documentaries/research literature, which I eventually regretted ever having become obsessed with, as they tended to prejudice my experiences.\r\n\r\nLSD didn\'t deliver what I was led to believe - in fact quite the opposite. One particularly upsetting trip went from hilarity to a genuine re-living of a childhood trauma which I still can\'t explain the source of, and feelings of total aloneness on a cosmic scale.  It took a while for me to calm down, but it left me with a few months of night terrors, depression and a feeling of desperation. Like Howard Marks in his biography, I thought the solution was \'more acid\' as I felt I had somehow \'failed\' the test - more hippier-than-thou 60\'s machismo. This all changed with psilocybin. \r\n\r\nI decided not to mess with LSD any more, but still felt I was on to something. Being brought up in Ireland, the myth of the pookie was something every kid knew, tales of the mushroom. On a bright saturday afternoon, a friend and I decided to look for the mushrooms. Walking through our local park, we met a man who strangely enough, had the same idea that day and had already collected hundreds. He gave us some bags, and before we knew it my friend and I had collected an estimated 800 liberty caps. We were immediately struck by the synchronicity of the day - everywhere we looked were clusters beside clusters.\r\n\r\nThat night, myself and a few friends, including my then girlfriend, brewed a very strong tea from our harvest. We drank the juice of 150-200 each and made a second brew. We then went on the 15 minute walk back to the park. I knew it was gonna be a biggie within 8 or 9 minutes, when we stopped outside a pub to chat to a few friends who were out in the sun.\r\n\r\nI started getting a bit anxious because of my previous hard times on acid, and my legs were beginning to jellify. 2 minutes later we were walking to the park, and I stopped to vomit. This made my friends laugh so much that it forced the experience to break through simultaneously, even for poor me! I felt immediately, and this was wierd, that I was vomiting all the fear and doubt out of my body - this shocked me so early in the trip, and I felt bulletproof after it. Once in the park, we naturally went out on our own, and something amazing happened.\r\n\r\nAs I walked down through the park, I felt myself grow huge, tall and powerful, I could not believe it! These fucking mushrooms loved me! It was so different to LSD, I felt safe, warm and sane. A huge wave rose through me and emerged as song, I walked along singing in joy, I dont know what I was singing, but it was euphoria. It was only years later when I\'d given up on the 1960s literature and read McKenna et al, that I learnt of the commonality of this experience. My song cut beauty out of the clouds, and the sun rapidly set before me, in perfect harmony with my song. All I can safely say is that it was a bluesy number!\r\n\r\nWe moved on as it grew dark, and a personally fundamental difference between the mushroom and acid became apparent. On acid, no matter how I tried, I felt like the world was still intact, real and concrete, and that I was fucked in the head from a drug I\'d taken. On Psilocybin, I was perfect, the world was the thing that was screwed up. My thoughts were clear and refined, my body and mind were one and the same. The mushroom let me gaze on trees and mountains with awe, and when I looked at cars and houses, I laughed! Its hard to describe, but the mushroom was directly telling me something about time, eternity, and temporality - the eternal moved me to reverence, the mundane just looked silly.\r\n\r\nThe feelings we all felt that night, I have never equalled. We held hands in another park and without speaking, we had common experiences of the shifting and rolling of the ground beneath us, the movement of the earth, to a point where we all held hands to keep from \'falling off\'- this was a joyous feeling. The stars were surrounded with their own individual green spirals, and shot primary coloured prisms down at us. The whole \'celtic\' aspect of our visions was bizarre - in fact, it shocks me there is not more info available on Irish historical use of the \'shroom among academics, as everyone in Ireland seems to feel theyre part of our history and culture. Either way, the visuals were very \'celtic\' lozenges and spirals with eyes closed, and a sense of the \'eyes-closed\' state as being a \'physical space\' in and of itself.  Hard to describe. Rows of green and purple mushrooms interwove the celtic designs.\r\n\r\nWe all felt invisible, myself and my girlfriend were never closer as our bones rolled into each other when we embraced, similar to experiences on acid where parts of my body would melt, which felt beautiful.  One friend thought he was dead - I told him he was but that we would be back soon.  He didn\'t like that much. Up the hills to the forest, and the peak began to fade leaving that MDMA-like feeling of love and connectedness.\r\n\r\nI felt so good, so clean, I remember calling to another friends house to tell him how I was going to give up the smokes, the drink - I genuinely felt this was revealed by the substance, though I suppose its common sense! The thought of putting a dirty chem like nicotine into me became abhorrent.  Un4tunately, by the time I was eating ecstasy regularly, this went out the window.\r\n\r\nThats all I can really say.  I\'ve taken them a couple of times since, but kind of moved away from these experiences as I left my twenties. Now in my 30\'s, and with a hole in my life, the old spirit is rising again.  I look 4ward to this september, and natures bounty. Its time to go back, the synchronicities have been enough to make a sceptic like me believe they\'re trying to get in touch.  I reckon they have something to show me.\r\n\r\nIll be back to let u know their latest message.\r\n\r\nCoCo 72"
36433,One Movement Into a Million Thoughts...,Odie,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIt\x92s a Halloween night, I\'m dressed up as a soldier. I get in around 8:00pm and I take my first 2.5gs orally in a tea. After a few minutes of finishing them off, my friend tells me that I shouldn\x92t have eaten so much because I\x92m real little both short and skinny and that I don\x92t know what I\x92m in for. I shrug.  We proceed to the \'Floyd Room.\' This \'Floyd Room\', is a pitch-black room where there\x92s nothing but Pink Floyd playing sometimes other bands like The Doors, or The Beatles.  While I\x92m in there waiting for the mushrooms to kick in I\x92m thinking about a movie I last watched \'Apocalypse Now\' which is my favorite [Vietnam] war movie and eventually after sitting thinking about that movie, I can feel the room I\x92m in expand, it feels as if it grew about another 20 feet and all the objects in there disappear besides me and my friend because I can hear him giggling and breathing, I begin to grow confused as to what I\x92m feeling because this is my first time trying shrooms.  \r\n\r\nAfter the effects kick in a bit more, I get a hold of what I think the trip will be like. I begin to giggle so I lie down to see what visuals I get if any, I close my eyes and nothing seems to happen, all of a sudden I feel the room shrink, so I quickly open my eyes, and in front of me it seems as if the wall moved really close to me and there were many different colors, in a plaid pattern, I reach out to see if I can touch this pattern but with no luck it just moves further away. I then notice a small stream of light coming through a small crack in the window, it begins giving off little waves of shadows through the darkness, I begin opening and closing my eyes, playing with the vibes from the stream of light and the Plaid pattern that keeps appearing. \r\n\r\nAll of a sudden my friend lights a match and moves it slowly until it burns out, it boggled my mind, it made many thoughts go through my head and my body began to feel like it was full of sand. He continued to do so, I eventually became use to it and knew how to play with the bright light of the flame. Every time the flame would glow I would try and absorb it into my body, so I could feel this warm sensation go through my entire body.  \r\n\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of playing with those matches, my reality was shattered. Another friend who was also on shrooms came crashing through the door and whipped on the light, I felt like I was a rat in a sewer and some kids shined a flashlight on me. My first instinct was to flee just in case it was danger so I scurried underneath a desk but then after that blindness went away from it going from pitch black to fluorescent light bright I came out and he was sitting there with another bowl with about three or four grams of dried shrooms in it. Him and my other friend starting eating them so I thought to myself I think I\x92m at my peak so I began munching down as well like they we\'re potato chips. But I glanced at his watch and I found out it has been only 30 minutes and my trip had only began and I now have more shrooms in me. So the lights go back off, and I begin thinking of things in my life, looking for answers to some things, and questioning myself with everyday questions but I think of nothing that I haven\x92t thought of before while sober. So I get my lighter out and start flickering it, making the flame dance for me as if it was my own little friend. I called him my own little friend because I could get him to dance and move and stay however long as I pleased as well as somehow absorbing the energy it would be giving off sending that sensation through my body. \r\n\r\nI put my lighter away because the metal on it grew too hot and I burnt myself and it scared me and sent a feeling of anxiety through my body so I sat against the wall and concentrated on breathing. My friend then starting playing with his matches while he was doing this \'The End\' by \'The Doors\' came on. Which made me think of \'Apocalypse Now\'  again because it\x92s the intro song on that movie.  At this time the shrooms have kicked in a lot more and I remember I\x92m in my soldier costume, and that at the Beginning of the movie during this song there was napalm falling everywhere and my friend\x92s matches also resembled that, so I started breathing really fast and thinking/feeling there could be a war on the go and I\x92m part of it. So I try and control myself so I get back into my shelter (Under the desk) and I begin giggling and laughing and breathing fast because everything was so perfect and intertwining so beautiful. [The End Playing, Me Dressed up as a Soldier, Matches being lit resembling napalm a fair bit] I felt as if I was in the movie. But soon enough the song changed, and the matches ran out.\r\n\r\nAfter about 60-90 minutes the mushrooms have started to hit me really hard, I start breathing a lot faster, shorter quick breaths. It makes me worry, and makes me start to think again, about everything. This time Life. Which is where my trip began to go downhill. I begin questioning life, and trying to figure out the meaning. I narrowed down everything. I made everything in life seem like it had no point or meaning, because we all die in the end. I thought it would make a difference if I went out and started tearing my friend\x92s house apart because the worst that would happen to me is that I go to jail, get beat up etc..etc... and I\x92d just die in the end, which was the outcome to any situation I put in front of me, \'I\x92d just die in the end\' so I started getting really scared at this point. Also upstairs people are jumping up and down banging on the floor, for some reason I think it\x92s a fight breaking out. And all these thought of life being pointless, a fight breaking out upstairs, me dying in the end is all racing through my mind. So I get up as fast as I can I race out to a half well lighted room I open a window or two, I sit down and I start controlling my breathing again. I then begin to shoot some Jack Daniels to help waken me up/(sober me up [yeah, right]) and come to realization of it\x92s just the mushrooms. I then get complete control of my trip again.\r\n\r\nThe last part seemed really scary at first but when I thought about it, I came to the conclusion I actually enjoyed it, I enjoyed the thrill and the adrenaline that shot through my body while I was really scared and in attack mode (when I thought the fight broke out). \r\n\r\nAt first I thought that shrooms would ressemble acid, but I was wrong. Mushrooms are much darker and I have to have a lot more self control when using them."
19069,Slipping Into the State of Unknown Identity,Audiofreq,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nI have had a few experiences with psilocybin, taking a few light to moderate doses, and although finding them very enjoyable I have had no true trips, merely a very \'high\' sensation.\r\n\r\nThe experience began in the house of my good friend F and friends with whom and at who\'s house I had first taken MDMA. His house is perfect for drug induced experiences as it has calm lighting, strobe lighting, lots of drum n bass music, plenty of water, plenty of space and no stairs (always handy).\r\n\r\nI arrived at F\'s around 6:30pm and found him and friends at the tail end of a hard MDMA comedown. He suggested we all have some mushrooms. For the record F had recently picked around 2500 liberty caps. The standard dosage for moderate effects of these mushrooms\' quality is 30-50. He gave me two handfuls which were roughly 150. I was at first wary of the high dose due to my limited experience but decided I was able to handle this and proceded to take them. I find myself extremely lucky in that I am able to chew and hold mushrooms in my mouth for any amount of time (they taste quite foul but I can handle it unlike most others). F ate around 150 as well while most others had 50-75. The process of chewing on and swallowing all 150 odd mushrooms took around 25 minutes. I later discovered that this constant chewing meant I had musrooms in my mouth for almost all the time meaning a large amount of psilocybin was absorbed in my mouth. I was very surprised when I began to \'come up\' 10 minutes after the last swallow.\r\n\r\nI felt a great sense of happiness and euphoria like a very strong cnnabis high. This resulted in much giggling and laughing. Then my first proper visuals began to came to me. I noticed as I looked at F across the room on the couch the stone wall (his house is a bungalow joined onto the wall of a castle) began to ripple like the surface of water. I remarked this to everyone and was greeted with laughs. I stared at the wall and the textures bagan to flow around like fluid. I decided I was now properly tripping and decided to stand and walk as I had a very slight nauseous feeling. I walked over to a wooden door and the grains in the wood moved and warped as if I was watching the wood grow in super fast motion. All horizontal and vertical surfaces began rolling and stretching but not in a way that was scary at all. I sat down and had a cigarette which felt nice and proceeded to eat 100-150 more liberty caps.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later a visual struck me and stayed with me all night. It was as if a very strong lightbulb had been placed in a box and patterns and spirals cut into the box and this pattern was projected as light around the room. Walls, ceilings, hands, faces all had this amazing shimmering subtle light pattern swirling and rippling over their surface. I looked around and every single action of movement was met with \'disturbance\' trails as if my hands were boats leaving wakes in the water.\r\n\r\nI sat around chitchatting to everyone else and loaded a very large bong with very potent weed. I smoked this and then an awful experience occured which will never leave me.\r\n\r\nI started feeling sick after the bong and wanted a cigarette. I felt like vomiting and so walked outside (outside meaning a courtyard surrounded by walls of F\'s house). I immediately felt dizzy and sat down. Then I started to have an intensely bad trip, very very hard.\r\n\r\nI felt confused alone isolated and paranoid at first. As if everyone inside was laughing and jeering at me. This feeling of isolation stayed with me for about 5 minutes growing progressively worse and then I slipt into a \'mushroom hole\' (if such things exist). Instantly I forgot who I was. this may sound hard to explain but I lost all sense of reality around me and who I was. All I can properly explain was my mind asking questions such as \'Who are you\' \'what are you doing\'. Images of my friends flashed up in my minds eye and they began jeering and laughing. This was made all the more scary because at the time I didnt know who my friends were as I had lost grip of anything that meant anything to me.\r\n\r\nI vaguely remembered how to treat people who are having bad trips and tried to apply this to myself. I began telling my unknown identity \'You have taken magic mushrooms\' \'this is a trip, it will end, relax and realise you are a sane person\'.\r\nI really felt like I was losing my mind but this self mediation helped and I relaxed but still had no clue who I was. All I remember after this was sipping into a fearful state but I heard (hallucinated in my head) this beautiul clean, crisp piano music, very slow and soothing and I think this helped somewhat. then F came to the door and said \'S\' (me) , whats up man\'. I immediately looked at F and snapped out of my state of unknown. I went to sit down with F and a guy called R who had just arrived but only smokes weed. I explained to them my previous bad trip and felt very much better.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the night I just had a mildly high feeling and no visuals except the light patterns on the walls. Around 8 hours after first eating the mushrooms a very bad sense of fear began taking over me. I immediately ran to the bathroom and forced myself to vomit. I vast sea of brown filthy vomit exited me and all trippy effects left. I went to sleep and woke up and couldn\'t eat anything or move too much the entire next day.\r\n\r\nI learned a very valuable lesson. Do not disrespect any drug, especially hallucinogens. The dosage I took, although survivable, was extremely stupid and made worse by my inexperience. Always prepare, research and dose accordingly and never lose your head before you even begin to experience the drug by getting stupid.\r\n\r\nPeace Out"
29453,I was Dead and Reborn that Day,Maco,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, Passion Flower, Cannabis & Zolpidem","\nIt was early afternoon the 22 December, I got of work early because of the upcoming holiday. I didn\'t plan the trip, but while chatting with an old friend he decided to start the Christmas celebration with 15mg 2C-B, he kept insisting on that I should join him on the journey to the place of spells and fairies. When he finally convinced me I thought I\'d take a \'light\' trip, I consider myself a fairly experienced tripper, I\'ve done LSD, 2C-B and several other psychedelic drugs numerous times. I\'ve previously done 3 g Semilanceata and 5.5 g Cubensis on separate occasions so I figured 1.5 g wouldn\'t beat my mind up too much.\r\n\r\nT+0:00\r\nI weighted the mushrooms carefully, previous dosage mistakes on other substances have made me cautious. Previous to eating the mushrooms I smoked a good-sized bowl of quality weed, I smoke every day and to my experience it usually mix quite well with tripping. The bowl got me quite stoned and kept me calm during the first effects of the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nT+0:40\r\nThe effects of the mushrooms are growing stronger, nothing unusual at this point. My tripping chat-friend is already way up there and tells me that he needs to spend some time outdoors, I don\'t argue with him because I know the urge to pay a visit to mother nature can be very overwhelming. I decide it\'s time for me to take a break from the computer as well, I find my way halfway to the kitchen when I remember that I\'ve got some passionflower stashed upstairs. I know that MAOI\x92s are supposed to boost mushrooms, and I feel quite comfortable in the trip so far so I decide to make myself some tea. I\'ve never tried MAOI\x92s during a trip before, but the added ingredient doesn\'t concern me at all. An unknown amount of passionflower is soaked in boiling water and stirred until it\'s cooled down, I filter the brew and bring it back to my computer.\r\n\r\nT+1:00\r\nI loaded another bowl of weed and enjoyed it along with the tea. After the second bowl the mushroom shifted gears on me, I got a slight headache and decided to rest for a while. I find my way to the bed, manage to place \'The Wall\' in the DVD and threw myself on my bed trying to get rid of the annoying headache.\r\n\r\nApprox. T+1:30\r\nWhat am I doing? What\'s happening to me? The questions are rushing trough my head, which is no longer bothering me, the headache is gone. I can still hear Pink Floyd playing in the background, I do not dare open my eyes however. The effects of the mushrooms are increasing constantly and is starting to become quite overwhelming, I\'m not sure how long I\'ve been tripping but I realise that I should be peaking soon. I\'ve got the shivers and pull every blanket I\'ve got far up over my head. Here, buried in blankets the music starts fading in and out. I start thinking about me, my past and my future. The thoughts form images of both beauty and terror, the images turns into white flashing lights which travel trough my brain faster than the thoughts themselves.\r\n\r\nApprox. T+2:00\r\nThe effects of the mushroom are still increasing, I feel completely lost and realise that I\'m about to die. As I await my doom the flashes through my head is getting more and more intense, but I feel completely indifferent to the fact that my ego is being completely disassembled. The music is gone, I\'m not sure where there the DVD is still playing, but it doesn\'t matter, nothing matters anymore. I temporarily \'pass out\', I\'m aware that I\'m passed out but I\'m not aware of anything in the real world. All my senses are gone, I now only exist in this world of nothingness, I\'m dead.\r\n\r\nT+3:00\r\nI wake up with a strong feeling of satisfaction, I\'ve been reborn. I\'ve never experienced an ego death before, I\'ve feared from the day I insufflated way too much 2C-B, I almost died back then as well. I get out of my bed, still tripping like never before. I carefully start to investigate my apartment and soon find it to boring to remain inside. I dress warm and go out for a walk. It\'s cold outside, about -15\xb0C, the snowstorm the night before has formed beautiful snow formations in the trees, on the ground, the roofs of the houses... The sky is completely clear, the stars form beautiful fractal formations in the sky, much like the clouds in my LSD-experiences. Suddenly I find myself outside my house again, deciding to go in and get another cup of tea but this time I stick to Yellow Label.\r\n\r\nT+4:30\r\nI can feel the effects decreasing and decide to make the best of the upcoming afterglow, I slice up a grapefruit and bring it and the tea up to my bedroom. I carefully study the bed before laying down, the place where I died, the place where I was reborn. I put on the TV and manage to find an entertaining show which I decide to follow at the best of my abilities.\r\n\r\nT+6:00\r\nThe effects are still present but much barely noticeable, I always seems to have shorter effects of mushrooms than my friends strangely enough. I decide to smoke another bowl of weed, after this bowl I feel how exhausted my mind actually is and decide to head back to the bed to get some sleep. This proved impossible though, my mind was still doing overtime so I swallowed 5mg Stilnox just to slow things down a bit. Half an hour later I fall asleep.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nI don\'t know where there it was the MAOI that triggered this extreme experience, but it seems likely. This trip blew my mind like a stick of dynamite, much more extreme than any other mushroom trip I\'ve ever had. I don\'t know if I should classify this experience as a good one or a bad one, it was neither, but I\'ve learned that MAOI\x92s can be an interesting additive to mushrooms. I will, without a doubt, try this again sometime in the future. This combo should be handled with care though, you just might end up with more than you bargained for."
25409,"White Light, Evil Heat",Hej San,MAOI & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI have a story to share when it comes to combining MAOIs and hallucinogens. Sadly, my experience was very negative. Two days ago I decided to try out two capsules which I was given when buying Psilocybe mushrooms at a headshop (no longer in business). I was told that I should take one or both of them some hour or so before eating the mushrooms and that the capsules were going to boost the trip considerably. Since I\x92m pretty experienced when it comes to psychedelics, I asumed the capsules I was given contained some sort of MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors). I seem to remember seeing the name harmine or possibly harmaline written on the bowl where the capsules were kept, but I can\x92t say for sure what type of MAOIs I was given.\r\n\r\nPrior to my trip, I made some research on what one can and cannot eat when taking MAOIs. I had heard it could be dangerous to drink coffee when taking the stuff, but I also found out that there are a lot of other food and drinks one should avoid. Since I\x92m very careful when it comes to ingesting substances that are new to me, I made sure to avoid all those things I was warned about. Still, it all went terribly wrong. \r\n\r\nSo what happened? Well, my intention was to obtain a full psychedelic experience \x96 something to remember and learn from. I decided to take the mushrooms on an empty stomach. The mushrooms were quite old and I was thinking that maybe they wouldn\x92t be as potent as they once were. I\x92ve taken psychedelics and not eaten much at all before, but never done it on a completely empty stomach. Also, since I was dealing with a compound that was possibly dangerous in combination with certain food, I thought not eating anything before was the safest thing to do. So I took one capsule and waited for about an hour. Then I had about one gram of Psilocybe Semilanceata and one gram of Psilocybe Cubensis, ie. about two grams in total. I don\x92t normaly combine different sorts of mushrooms, but where I live they are sometimes hard to obtain, so I had to take these \x94left-overs\x94 that had been lying around for quite a while. I also took the second capsule at the same time as eating the mushrooms. \r\n\r\nAfter about twenty minutes I started to feel the mushrooms/capsules coming on. The feeling was definitely different from how I usually experience psilocybin/psilocin. It didn\x92t take long before I started to feel sick. I was also becoming extremely warm and had to take off all my clothes. My skin was getting very hot and I had to start pouring water onto my arms, legs, chest and face. I was constantly thirsty and had to stop myself from drinking too much. The feeling was not unlike my prior experiences with Ecstasy and its side effects. Though, this time much more intense. The terrible heat I was feeling inside my body didn\x92t go away, and at one point I opened the freezer and sat down touching the icy steel inside. But I couldn\x92t feel any coolness coming out from it. My physical condition was in a pretty bad shape. I was feeling tired and dizzy and I realised that my idea of not eating anything before was maybe not that great after all. \r\n\r\nSo in a vain attempt to get some energy into my body I tried to eat an apple, but I vomited immediately. There was no way I could eat anything at this point. I was feeling poisoned, like I had been stung by some insect or something and I was considering calling a doctor. Though, I decided to wait and see if I could \x94survive\x94 without any medical assistance.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I persevered and managed to get back to normal without going to any hospital. After about three hours I came down a little bit, but the trip went on for many hours after this. It took about nine hours to reach a state of feeling semi-normal. I did like some of the effects though. It was interesting to experience what was to me a \x94new\x94 psychedelic and I very much liked the Amazonian/rainforest vibe it generated. I cannot really explain this, but I was actually feeling like a native indian tripping in the depth of a rainforest. But needless to say, the negative side effects completely overshadowed any positive aspects of the combination of the mushrooms and the capsules. \r\n\r\nI can now see that I made some mistakes: If I had eaten some food before the trip I would have had much more energy to fight back the negative side effects. Also, mixing two sorts of mushrooms is something I will never do again. It is spiritually wrong. I\x92ve experienced how P. Cubensis is talking to me (after ingesting four grams) and who knows, maybe the spiritual forces/beings in that paticular mushroom don\x92t get along well with those inherent in P. Semilanceata. In my mind, psychedelic mushrooms like P. Sem, P. Cubensis and the extremely potent (and mostly psilocin containing) Stropharia Cyanescens are very different from each other. I also let myself down by eating gelatine capsules. I believe in animal liberation and we certainly don\x92t have to murder beatuiful living beings to obtain psychedelic states. Though, the side effects I was experiencing were very nasty and what happened to me didn\x92t just have to do with my psychological state of mind at the time. Was I experiencing some sort of allergic reaction? I guess I will never find out what actually happened. \r\n\r\nFinally, I must point out that I\x92m not saying that one shouldn\x92t go near this stuff. Just be careful though. MAOIs are obviously very powerful. It also worries me that things like harmine/harmaline, just like MDMA, increases the serotonin levels in our brains (that is what I\x92ve read anyway). Also, if you feel that you have to boost your mushroom trip you\x92re definitely not taking enough of God\x92s flesh. Mushrooms are perfect without any additional compounds."
8727,Bad Trip Changed Me,Doode,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nOne weekend, a good friend gave around 5 grams of some dried mushrooms as a favour. (I was complaining that no-one is interested in acid anymore in our area) I have taken mushrooms before, and was excited as to the unique experience that my mind was about to create, but nothing would prepare me for the journey that lay ahead.\r\n\r\nAt about 11pm on the Sunday, I decided to brew a tea with the mushrooms and (foolishly) spend the night by myself, cavorting in the deepest realms of my inner conciousness. I began to feel the effects around 20 minutes later, (I had been fasting all evening) and they were very intense but enjoyable - colors and surges of intense empathy and love with all living things. Then it suddenly became more intense. I was switching the tv from cartoons to music videos and all of a sudden they began playing backwards almost slowing down as they did so. \r\n\r\nI found this hilarious and began to laugh hysterically only to find that the effect had begun to wear off slightly. As I lay back down on my bed rather disappointed, I smoked a joint and the effect returned almost immediately, this time much more intense than the previous, and, because my body and mind were both unprepared for this sudden surge of emotion, my stomach became cramped and I felt both very nervous and uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nAn ice hockey game was now on tv and I heard the commentator mumble something about a \'young man who overdosed on mushrooms\'. Now I know that an overdose is practically impossible as our stomachs simply aren\'t big enough to ingest a fatal dose, but I was pretty far gone by this point.\r\n\r\nPanic!\r\n\r\nThe emotion overwhelmed me like a wave. Was I dying? Was I dead?.\r\n30 minutes after ingesting the little creatures I felt dissolved.\r\nThe mushrooms have never come on as sudden as this before and although the cramps and discomfort had long gone, I perceived this as a sign that I was no longer alive. I chased and chased the only rational thought that was running through my mind at the time, and I eventually figured out how to use the telephone and called my friend to come over. I find it strange that I could remember his phone number through the mess of data that was my memory. (I can\'t recall any of the conversation but my friend says that I was repeating the phrase \'I don\'t know what\'s happening\' over and over)\r\nMy friend unfortunately has no experience with psychedelic drugs, and did not know what to do to distract me and I could not think rationally. Every few minutes (or was it seconds?)\r\n\r\nI would think that I was holding my breath and gasp for air, panicking at the thought of suffocating. The only thing I could think of was the hospital. I was absolutely terrified and wanted the doctors to tell me I was not going to die so we drove to the hospital and that was when the trip became totally different. I had accepted death by this time and I can remember letting myself \'drift off\'. \r\n\r\nI had convinced myself that my 24 years on this planet had been my life \'flashing before my eyes\' and I began to forgive all of my enemies, even love them as I regained an appreciation for this unique and wonderful gift of life that we have received. I had visions of loved ones with open arms and memories of childhood as I lay with my eyes closed. The next hour or so I cant quite recall, but I remember one of the nurses asking if I felt tired and I think the mere suggestion of this was enough to send me to sleep if only for a short time.\r\n\r\nWe drove home and I told my friend to get some sleep as I explored the colors and strange new dimensions of my room in the remaining afterglow of my trip. Because I thought that I was dying, the mushrooms forced me to examine my life fully. (Probably for the first time ever.) I returned from my trip believing that if you are unhappy in life, YOU are the only person who can rectify this. I was  extremely unhappy with my \'friends\' who turned out to be nothing like true friends, and it wasn\'t until i thought i was dying that i realised this and it was up to me to make MYSELF happy.\r\nThis is my message to all you non-believers out there.\r\n\r\nLife is for living friends, live now before its too late..."
87764,Translucent Psychic Fluid Amongst Other Stuff,barton,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\n<!-- Long, but worth it I assure you..\r\n\r\n-->This is an experience I had last night with about 110 liberty caps, 40 dry, 70 wet. My first few shroom trips have taken place over the past 2 months, they have all been quite low doses, the highest being 25 fresh. This was to be a solo shamanic journey like I have had previously with baby Woodrose and Ayahuasca along with countless drug experiences.\r\n\r\nMy psychedelic plant use has been increasing exponentially since January, my depression and anxiety was completely transformed into a profound new awareness which some might deem spiritual after my first trip on morning glory seeds. I now remain in awe of the mystery and seek to learn more.\r\n\r\nWhat I experienced last night was remarkable; I produced the translucent liquid in my mouth which I recall Terence McKenna once describing and experienced a very strange synchronicity.\r\n\r\nLet\x92s call 8.30pm T-0.00\r\n\r\nT-0.00 \x96 Started eating mushrooms, ate about 30 between now and T+0.30. I had a mild headache before the trip, this seems to happen a lot before I attempt tryptamines and very rarely in other occasions.\r\n \r\nT+0.15 \x96 Felt them coming on already, I felt very light and slightly disorientated. I wondered whether I should continue to eat more, it was the usual slight anxiety before tripping.\r\n\r\nT+0.30 \x96 My peripheral vision is morphing objects within it into people who are frozen in strange positions, they seem to ask me to come forward into the bizarre. I think of how the mushroom does not give me a direct path, but shows that I have the choice whether or not to eat more and continue. During my 25 shroom trip I had told the mushroom it was very strange, as soon as I had said this, a shock went through my body which paralysed me with fear. I thought that perhaps I and the mushroom did not mix and that LSA was my calling. It was slightly worrying that I did not yet know my dosing levels.\r\n\r\nT+1.00 \x96 Have just finished eating all the shrooms, the body buzz was coming on quite strong. I got the usual sensation of a physic corkscrew being drilled into my forehead. I could not find any other reports of this sensation. I was playing some Terence McKenna video, it was my marker, when his words started to seem more and more profound and meaningful then I would know I was ready to lie down in darkness and feel what was happening. I had lit candles and an incense stick so that I could still navigate myself and to give it a good atmosphere.\r\n\r\nT+1.30 \x96 I was lying in my bed and realised I was sweating, I took my socks off. I closed my eyes to see a strange scenario. There was a man who seemed menacing operating a strange machine producing a constant stream of strange looking paper, a little girl was at the end of the machine where the paper was coming out, she seemed like she was being forced to interact with this paper somehow and she was frightened. I took this as a metaphor for the modern world and its materialistic nature.  Immediately after this there was a multicoloured flowing membrane which seemed earthly and natural. It was gradually getting closer to me, there was lots of verbal nonsense in the back of my head as this was happening and as it got closer the strange feelings in my forehead began to morph and expand getting more and more intense. I was tempted to open my eyes to end it, and I did. I tried again and the object took over my whole visual field, I pondered how far this trip would go.\r\n\r\nT +2.00 \x96 I was laying with my eyes open, watching the walls of my room. Mushrooms seem to produce this translucent, metallic energy field which covers everything. It\x92s like a layer of psychic cling-film. As I lay there, I realised that I may have come as far as I can with the psychedelics for now, no more revelations were to be found; now I only had to work out what I was to do with my spare time. This got me thinking that I\x92d just be waiting for the trip to finish now after an array of visuals, but this could not be, I just need to accept the fact that trips are unpredictable; the next wave is inconceivable while perceiving the current one.\r\n\r\nI started to think what I was to do with my spare time, or what anyone was to do with spare time. What do we do in life? Work, university, hobbies? They all seemed ridiculous, there must be more than this, why do so many people waste time doing basically nothing? I used to party a lot until I realised how senseless and mundane it was. It\x92s fun at first, but then you start to seek more as you come into adulthood. The majority of my friends are not finished with alcohol and trivial shit, I\x92ve found the psychedelics on my own and my relations to the people I used to hang about with are diminishing.\r\n\r\nWhat was one to do? People make candy-floss and McDonald\x92s toys for a living, people buy these things and it does not fulfil them, they serve no real purpose. Our society is built around consumerism and material things which get us nowhere. What should we be doing...\r\n\r\nMy mind sprung to the family, to creating more life. I started to desire a family of my own, it seemed so important to life, nothing is more important than the creation of more life in order to do what we, the previous generations could not. I thought of my father and how I have criticised him in the past, I realised that he had done what all humans set out to do but he has got lost in the world of matter, his spiritual journey has ended because of demeaning work and a disenchanted society. He now turns to television and collecting antiques, he used to smoke weed and embrace life I imagined (he did smoke weed and eat shrooms). I then realised what I had once read in one of Jung\x92s works, the son feels obliged unconsciously to seek what his father has failed in, particularly spiritual fulfillment. I had picked up where he had left off and started to seek the true philosopher\x92s stone in psychedelics. My father now unconsciously seeks this stone in antique objects and sci-fi and whatever sentiment he holds for them, he was rather like an alchemist. It was my father\x92s birthday in a fortnight, he is usually reluctant to receive presents, and I then decided I would give him the philosopher\x92s stone! An alchemy book, 100 dried mushrooms and a letter detailing these thoughts, or a poem.\r\n\r\nT+2.30 \x96 I suddenly realised my lips were coated in some smooth, translucent, sticky and lubricant substance. T+2.30 \x96 I suddenly realised my lips were coated in some smooth, translucent, sticky and lubricant substance. It was like some refined saliva. I had once heard Terence say that some shamans produced such a substance and they could use it to see into things. I forget where or how he exactly described it (someone help me out?). But immediately I \x93knew\x94 what to do with it, I put my right thumb and the finger next to it in my mouth, pulled it out, brushing them off my lips as I did so, I then looked at it to realise that something VERY strange was happening. It\x92s beyond difficult to describe. Somehow, intertwined with the drilling feeling in my forehead, I raised these fingers to this part of my head and slowly started to pull away from it, It felt like I was pulling something physically, like a thread coming from my head, I did this very slowly and carefully and a strange feeling went through my arm as I did this. \r\n\r\nWhat I seen as I was doing this I cannot put into words sufficiently. My face lit up in awe as I realised I was able to move the psychic cling-film which covered all I seen in various layers. As I looked at this I realised IT WAS THE PHILOSOPHER\x92S STONE. The feeling of synchronicity was amazing, shamanic ecstasy took over and I started speaking in tongues, this would arouse me more. I licked my hand with this stuff and played with it more. I considered that this was the ability to move the psychic imagery created by the mushroom using some mysterious matter which the mushroom produces in my mouth.  It was not only moving it, it was morphing it, I could see into time-space and its relation to my psyche. If I closed one eye I could pinch the edge of the layer of cling-film which covered my wall in patterns and I could shift the patterns as I pleased. I did this very slowly with some preciseness that seemed bizarrely natural to me. Has anyone experienced this? What the fuck is it? I wonder if others can see this phenomenon performed by myself when shroomed in my presence. The mushroom DID like me after all, It had taught me how to live, what mattered and induced me in shamanic ecstasy.  The place I was in was very similar to the Ayahuasca place.\r\n\r\nT+3.00 \x96 I needed to get up and write this down, as I got a pen, I realised I could use video on my laptop as I desperately needed to rant about this phenomenon and my revelations. Whilst talking to the camera I discovered my words were slurring together perfectly as if to create a language, I had been to speech therapy as a child for this reason, speaking too fast rendering me indecipherable. They never managed to completely sort out my linguistics, this felt meaningful to me as I spoke in tongues about Mckenna, the liquid, 2012, DNA, the number 64 being my favourite number since I was 7 years old simply because 8x8=64, this was mysterious to me and others as most people pick numbers 1 \x96 10. I thought of the I ching hexagrams, codones, amino acids, 64bit windows and how because of this, the I-ching has determined that the DNA of every life form will become one with the internet.\r\n\r\nT+3.30 \x96 I started another video and heard lightening, or what I thought was lightening, I opened the window to see a UFO flying across the sky making a bizarre sound, I licked my fingers and pulled from my head the psychic string directly towards where the UFO was heading, all the street lights and the light from what was probably just a plane (but it was a fucking disk at the time) created dynamic metallic fluid auras in which I could see through into hyperspace!\r\n\r\nThis is it! The synchronicity I have been experiencing throughout my trips, the discovery of the philosophers stone by the son of a man who had failed to seek it had triggered the coming of the UFO to tell us the grand secret. I imagined that at that moment everyone in the world just had such a meaningful revelation as I had had and novelty had reached maximum point, the universe was about to end in the final synchronistic act.  I jumped over to the laptop, as I did this, the village church bells rang signalling midnight, I looked at the timer on the video 23seconds, 23rd of January is my birthday, an Aquarian birth, the coming of the Age of Aquarius was now! I heard a cow starting to \x93Moo!\x94 from outside. The synchronicity was INSANE The synchronicity was INSANE it was like my psyche had tried to make this moment just to experience the intense shamanic euphoria that would result. This all occurred 2 days after finishing True Hallucinations detailing the synchronistic/schizophrenic events that followed from the McKenna\x92s mushroom experiment. I started to rant insanely to the camera, declaring that I would upload this to YouTube for the world to see, everyone would understand, shamanic video blogging would be massive.\r\n\r\nLooking back on this video however, I cannot make out a word I was saying, but the look on my face when I seen the number 23 and the cow started to moo (the cow makes the mushrooms, they are local) was insane to witness\r\n.\r\nT+4.30 \x96 This next hour was spent using the video-mirror, using my new found saliva skill and dancing in shamanic ecstasy to the beat of the universe as I contemplated how I would hug my mother and pronounce my feelings for my father the next day. As I danced, I looked in the mirror to see my whole self morph into an alien robot with metallic eyes which signalled my hyperspacial existence at that time. My whole body was tense, I felt everything with a deep intensity, the flow of my blood was immortal. I took a piss which was orgasmic, I looked in the mirror again to see that I had tribal pattern auras on my face and I was breathing furiously like an animal. I was a shaman, I was always to be a shaman, and this is the true sacrament, the direct experience of nature. What was I to do? Maintain university and work whilst exploring these realms occasionally? Write a book? Move to South America and seek training? I\x92m still baffled.\r\n\r\nThere are countless other things I could say about this trip but I won\'t bore you. I spent the next hour in bed calming down and reverting to sleep, feeling my whole body wildly tense and instinctually primal.\r\nWhat should one make of these things...\r\nThank you for reading."
109648,Ceasing to Exist on My First BAD Trip,kisen,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis is a report of my first bad trip.\xa0I had already tripped about 4 times lower doses of liberty cap and had gotten acquainted with the psychedelic world. The aim of this day was to experience the phenomenon of Ego-death.  For a long time I had wanted to break through and see the world outside my own mind and the restrictions it places on my experiences, and boy, I sure did.\r\n\r\nThe basis for this trip was somewhat bad. I knew I should wait a a week, because I tripped the day before (although a  very low dose).\xa0I had not slept much, and was somewhat upset and felt a slight anxiety I tripped the day before (although a  very low dose).\xa0I had not slept much, and was somewhat upset and felt a slight anxiety in the body due to lack of sleep.\xa0\r\n\r\nAnyhow I started walking up the selected forest situated right by where I grew up.\xa0I know it in and out and it never ceases to fascinate me how calm and balanced this forest makes me feel.\xa0The perfect setting. \xa0I had not eaten anything all day, in line with the guidelines for admission.\xa0\r\n\r\nIt was a somewhat hot autumn day, sunny, with clear skies.\xa0I found me a perfect spot by a small river and some ruins of old habitation. \xa0There were no people nearby, not for at least a couple kilometers. I ingested a for me huge amount of liberty cap and started sipping on the ginger tea which I for the occasion had carried to counteract nausea.\xa0Previously I had tripped on lower doses out of respect for my innate sensitivity to drugs and chemical substances.\xa0 However this time, my goal was to go as far as I could go. What could go wrong? \r\n\r\nOn ear, music. Housy vibes. The sun was shining and everything was damn great.\xa0I walked around and looked at the ruins of an old farm, wondering who had lived there and how their lives had been.\xa0When the shrooms started to kick in I had to sit down. I sat on a stone wall and was sitting with the sun in my face with eyes closed.\xa0Visuals!\xa0Finally!\xa0This I had not experienced before.\xa0With eyelids as a pink orange backdrop, swirling around was a series of fractals in real Alex Grey style .. When I opened my eyes saw the trees around me like a painting similar to Van Gogh\'s star night. This was exciting.\xa0And very beautiful.\xa0\r\n\r\nWhen I held up the bottle of ginger tea against the sun and peered into it, it felt like I disappeared into its turbid water and became part of the ginger pieces flying around in a maelstrom of divine light.\xa0\r\n\r\nAt this point perhaps 45 minutes after taking the shrooms I decided to take more.\xa0This process took ten minutes or fifteen minutes.\xa0It tasted terrible, earthly and it was as if I was told to not go further. I did not listen. After eating too many shrooms to count I became conscious of the fact that my jacket, my backpack,  a plastic bag and a water bottle lay scattered on the ground in front of me in the woods.\xa0I felt like a drug addict who has set up temporary camp in broad daylight.\xa0I remember being desperate and thinking how I was going to be able to bring with me all this stuff, in what order I should do it. Should I place my water bottle in my bag first?\xa0Or should I put the bottle in the backpack and then put the plastic bag into the backpack.\xa0Should I wear my jacket?\xa0Why does my bag like a whale as smiling and laughing?\xa0Why is it eyes on all blueberry shrubs around me?\xa0At this point I\'m at least an hour in, and the effects are kicking in, hard. \r\n\r\nIt is autumn - sun goes down early over the small valley in the forest which I sit in, and it gets cold.\xa0I am moving to a spot of sun and feel a tremendous relief to have sun there with me.\xa0It\'s so life-giving, so warm and so damn different from what it tends to be.\xa0Light shines like silver, has the consistency of water and all areas illuminated by the acts warm and safe.\xa0I understand the concept of the sun being fundemental for life. \r\n\r\nThe sun disappeared and I started to trek up towards a place with views to the west where the sun was going to go down.\xa0The foliage in the fores had become purple.\xa0The forest seemed totally different from what it tends to be.\xa0So colorful and very alien. The clock was about 1800 when I arrived at the top of a 100 meter cliff.\xa0It was so nice, with view out and over the woods, toward a large mountain and sea.\xa0Here I was with the sun again and could enjoy the rest of the trip undisturbed by the cold and the dark that I felt looming in the shaded areas Perfect.\xa0This relief was the best feeling of the trip. \r\n\r\n\'I\'m actually a separate individual.\xa0It\'s quite insane \'\xa0\r\n\r\nAs I sit at the top of this cliff looking out over the forest with the sun on my face \x96 meaningless words begin to emerge in my head.\xa0One after another. Meaningless phrases and strings of word. What the hell, I thought.\xa0What is this!?.\xa0It appeared more, faster and faster, and at one point went all crazy.\xa0Phrase phrase, word by word \x96 meaningless. Fast fast fast.\xa0No context.\xa0Words that does not exist.\xa0I could not understand anything of it. I was over 1 hour and 30 minutes into my trip. \r\n\r\nSuddenly I was struck by the fact that I did not know where I was or how I had gotten there.\xa0Having scanned the surroundings I accept that I knew where I was and that it was safe there.\xa0But not long after struck me with just the same force that I did not know where I was again.\xa0I knew where I was, but I had no idea where I was.\xa0This was a very weird feeling, and weirder it would get. Approximately here I send a message to a buddy and say that I\'m in the woods, I probably gone crazy on shrooms but that it goes well and will be fine. I get a worried message back.\xa0Anxiety.\xa0Real anxiety emerges. \r\n\r\n\'Hell.\xa0Now I\'ve REALLY done it. \'\xa0\r\n\r\nThe idea of &#8203;&#8203;sending a text message to someone who was not informed of my trip despite the fact that he is my best friend was probably not the smartest idea\xa0His concern was for my well beeing, and it served as a confirmation of my own fear. I felt my fear and his fear. I became scared, and I turned off my phone. \r\n\r\nAround here I totally lost it.\r\n\r\n\'Hell .. What is happening?\xbb\xa0\r\n\'Am I psychotic?\'\xa0\r\n\'I\'m psychotic !!\xa0\xab\xa0\r\n\'Now I really fucked up. I\'m going to be admitted to the psychiatric clinic. Will I ever be normal again?\'\xa0\r\n\r\nI envision ambulance people.\xa0Police.\xa0Shame of being wheeled into the psych ward in a wheelchair.\xa0Shame because I was feeling psychotic, shame because I had lost myself completely. My thoughts swirling in rapid pace.\xa0It went so fast that I have never before experienced anything like it. \r\n\r\n\'Where am I?\'\xa0\r\n\'Who am I really?\'\xa0\r\n\'Why are my legs so god damn cold?\'\xa0\r\n\'How in hell did I get here !?\'\xa0\r\n\r\nAt this point, I kind of disappeared from myself.\xa0I barely felt my own body.\xa0It felt numb and very weak.\xa0I walk around thinking that if I had now tried to kill myself, then I would not have known anything other than relief of disappearing out of what felt like a damn scary experience with no end, I thought of dying.\xa0It seemed if death did not exist as anything but a concept.\xa0That death was nothing physical that occurred.\xa0I remember thinking that to die is not something that happens - but rather the opposite.\xa0Nothing happens.\xa0I could have died now and not pay any attention to it at all.\xa0And that was not something I wanted. It was quite a relief to arrive at this conclusion, because at the time I was so fucked up that I was unsure if I could come to harm myself. \r\n\r\nIt seemed like the glue that holds everything together disappeared.\xa0The world was somehow just full of ingredients.\xa0Trees.\xa0A mountain.\xa0A house in the distance.\xa0My feet.\xa0My hands.\xa0Light.\xa0Trees.\xa0They were just there.\xa0But there was nothing that kept them together.\xa0\r\n\r\nI hear birds.\xa0Crows scream.\xa0Birds flutter.\xa0But it was like a nightmare.\xa0The sounds somehow did not arise from any place.\xa0They were just there. Without setting.\xa0There was nothing between me and them.\xa0They never disappeared.\xa0They never showed up.\xa0In sober state feels like experiences and impressions are interrelated and that they are arranged with a kind of glue.\xa0A timeline.\xa0This glue disappeared completely.\xa0I experienced a total void.\xa0Tremendous confusion.\xa0\r\n\r\nI started walking.\xa0I wanted to go home to my bed.\xa0I knew at this point not know if I had any bed, if I stayed any place, who I was.\xa0Thoughts of my bed, my home and in what direction it lay appeared repeatedly and became a kind of direction in the overall confusion and soup of impressions that my brain had become. I resonated that if these images of my house and its direction pop up more often than anything else, and is the same every time, so it means I should follow them.\xa0Thousand thoughts at once.\xa0Words and phrases that do not mean a thing.\xa0Sounds.Sight.\xa0I did not understand why I was feet wet, why legs felt cold.\xa0Why legs were there.\xa0I could not understand anything. And I remember that I repeated this for high and low. \r\n\r\n\'I do not understand anything.\xa0I really cant understand anything at all. Hell.\xa0I do not understand anything!\'\xa0\r\n\r\nI walked and walked.\xa0Never got anywhere. I looked around and was in exactly the same place as I felt I had been for an hour.\xa0It was darker, but otherwise everything was equal.\xa0The moon had appeared \x96 in a clear evening sky the moon was sharper than it has ever been.\xa0Stars who usually fascinates me more than anything else, terrified me.\xa0\r\n\r\nI eventually came to a soccer field where I experienced real life rubberbanding.\xa0 <!-- http://www.urbandictionary.com/defin...=rubberbanding\xa0.\xa0-->It was the strangest feeling I can remember having experienced in my life.\xa0I felt I was moving forward but never arrived anywhere. And every step I took, I was back to square one.\xa0It felt like it took an eternity to walk over this field. \xa0\r\n\r\nI came home.\xa0Locked the door.\xa0Looked in the mirror.\xa0The one pupil was gigantic, the other was tiny.\xa0Wen to bed. Total void.\xa0No emotion.\xa0\r\n\r\nSuddenly everything was over and I remember a relief without equal.\xa0I\'m somehow sane again.\xa0I have not been psychotic.\xa0I just totally lost myself. \xabI will never do psychedelics again\xbb.\r\n\r\nWow.\xa0\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, I am left with several observation.\xa0This was one of the most meaningful experiences I\'ve had in my life.\xa0It has given me greater respect for mushrooms, but also myself.\xa0 Set and setting is everything. This was unreal."
111992,I Attempted to Slightly Ween Off,IPutHotDogsUpMyBun,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Citalopram,"\nWeening off Citalopram for Shrooms\r\n\r\nKeywords: \r\ncitalopram, ssri, ssri withdrawal, psilocybe semilanceata, liberty caps, first time, ginger\r\n\r\nPreface: \r\nI\'ve been on the SSRI Citalopram for quite a while as a result of a traumatic breakup. It\'s about 10 months after and I feel less depressed but also kind of directionless and stagnant. I\'m looking to shrooms for answers. I attempted to slightly ween off the SSRIs before consuming shrooms. I found the consensus online is that mixing shrooms and SSRIs results in lessened effects or effects that seem more like drunkenness than a thoughtful eye-opening trip.\r\n \r\nDoses:\r\nCitalopram: [20mg/daily] x 10 months, [10mg/daily] x 3 days, [5mg] x 1 day, [0mg] x 1 day.  \r\nLiberty Caps: 0.8g over 1.5 hours.\r\n\r\nTo explain the above, I took 20mg of citalopram (a low/moderate dose) for 10 months, then prior to shroom day I took 10mg for a day, 10mg for a day, 10mg for a day, 5mg for a day, zero for a day, and then I shroomed the following day. Prior to shroom day I experience mild SSRI withdrawal symptoms: dizziness, discomfort and disorientation upon sudden changes in momentum, infrequent brain-zaps. \r\n\r\nThe experience:\r\nT+0:00 - I was nervous so I only took 0.8g grinded up into a hot chocolate with some sober friends. I strained some ginger into the water to attempt to bypass any stomach pains (seemed to work). I tasted a small dry piece of shroom and was surprised by mundane it tasted. I started sipping.\r\n\r\nT+0:15 - I\'m not even close to finishing the hot chocolate but I feel slight more goofy. It\'s possible it was placebo at this stage.\r\n\r\nT+1:00 - Still not done but I feel slightly intoxicated. Not tripping, no hallucinations, but I do feel an array of positive-vibes and a cannabis-like brain fog. Nothing that feels too unique from a cannabis or alcohol but welcome nonetheless.\r\n\r\nT+1:30 - Looking back I must have reached the \'peak\' before this point. Surprising to have that done so soon but I was on a low dose in combination with an SSRI. I finish the drink because I\'m not scared of getting the full experience.\r\n\r\nT+3:00 - Things have remained pretty mundane. I begin to feel tired but extremely comfy in my friends\' futon with my YouTube playlist running (mostly Tame Impala and the Tragically Hip). I sleep.\r\n\r\nT+4:00 - I wake up. Not long after this point I develop an annoying headache. I decide to take 5mg of citalopram to avoid further SSRI withdrawals. \r\n\r\nT+7:00 - I drive home and write this report. Headache is pretty annoying.\r\n\r\nForeword:\r\nI would not call this a \'trip\' and I think any cannabis user would feel at home with this experience. I\'d like to take a higher dose (maybe 2g or 2.5g) when the SSRI is out of my system. That said, one shouldn\'t do psychs really often so I\'ll try to give it some time. \r\n\r\nCheers"
93961,Set and Setting in the All That Is,energy elf,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis mushroom trip happened on New Years Eve 2009. I\x92ve taken many psychedelics over the years and consider these substances some of the most profound tools to explore life with. I wasn\x92t expecting to take mushrooms this night and they were given to me as a gift by my cousin\x92s partner after I\x92d consumed a bottle of wine in the first few hours of the party \x96 now the rest of the group consisted of around 15 people in addition to me and the friend I had travelled down with. ~I only knew my friend, my cousin and her partner but I\x92ve only seen my cousin 4 times in ten years. \r\n\r\nI hadn\x92t taken mushrooms or any psychedelics for around 2 years before this night \x96 I took around 60 dried liberty caps hand picked by my cousin\'s partner who I will call Phil \x96 Phil is a friendly fella but he\x92s also like a large child in that he bounces around larger than life, very loud and always roughly play fighting with his brother. I was quite excited and in good spirits especially with the surprise element of the shroom gift, the time of year, the full moon and general good vibe in the house. \r\n\r\nThe shrooms came on as they usual do for me with a distinctive funny, giggly, tingling sensation in my stomach, it\'s like an elf is actually stuck inside me and the only way for it to escape is to tickle me from the inside out it\'s like an elf is actually stuck inside me and the only way for it to escape is to tickle me from the inside out. This was followed by the jaw stretching but very pleasant yawning \x96 then came the gentle waves of energy lapping over me with accompanying subtle changes in perception, like better hearing, sharper vision and the ability to slow down facial expressions, giving me the overall sense that I could experience people more fully and clearly.  \r\n\r\nThis is about an hour in to the experience\x96 and I was ecstatic, feeling utterly energised and happy to be back in with the universal vibrations \x96 the vibration had also slowed everything down to the gently pulsing loving vibe and I feel encircled in the light of universal energy \x96 I\x92m moving around the party talking, listening and just feeling connected completely to the all that is. I spent some time listening to Aretha Franklin singing live on an album and it feels like she is all around me, inside me, in my mind more real than the floor I was sitting on. Amazing and I am in orgasmic rapture. \r\n\r\nSuddenly Phil tells me he needs to talk to me, he looks anxious, troubled and slightly menacing \x96 its thick snow and freezing outside but he tells me to leave the party and go out to his car \x96 I attempt to say let\'s talk in here but he grabs my arm and sort of pulls me outside. The energy changes. \r\n\r\nI follow him and his brother outside and its freezing with a full moon and lanterns are blurring across the night sky making it look like the hidden ones are making a rather obvious entry into our awareness \x96 we get to the car and I\x92m in the front along with Phil and his brother is in the back \x96 he speaks and his words leave his mouth, penetrate the air as an energy and curl around me like clouds of frankincense smoke \x96 I\x92m not so much hearing as experiencing his words - \r\n\r\nThrough the smoky energy I can make out that he\x92s telling me that his family are involved in the masons in France and what they are doing is troubling for him and conflicts with his beliefs and he doesn\x92t know what to do\x96 I turn in slow motion to ask his brother who now in the dark with his long hair looks like medusa on Jacobs ladder. He doesn\x92t say a word just looks at me \x96 Phil roughly grabs me and tells me in what seemed to me a threatening tone that I ought to be listening to him \x96 at this point I feel threatened so I remove his arm and I think I said \x91fuck this\x92 and opened the car door and got out \x96 this action seemed to take some time and I felt my whole being while still connected to everything, I felt like I was heaver than everything else like the air itself had become condensed and hard to navigate- \r\n\r\nI walked back to the house, feeling utterly split \x96 on one hand it seemed hilarious on the other terrifying \x96 unfortunately for me I chose to ruminate on the terrifying aspect and this became manifest for the next 6 hours \x96 I re-entered the party but Phil and his brother were nowhere to be seen \x96 it is a very large house with lots of room and land etc. so they were probably off doing something else \x96 anyway I entered the main room to find everyone sitting there chatting away so\x96I feel pushed to the ground by an energy and sit rigidly cross legged on the floor. \r\n\r\nI can\x92t remember this part very well but I recall feeling waves and waves of energy passing through me, it felt like as near as is humanly possible to be actual electricity. I remember after being forced to sit on the floor cross legged I just started talking \x96 in seconds the group of 15 who had been talking and communicating between themselves sat in silence listening intently to whatever I was saying \x96It was stuff along the lines of an attempt to describe what I was experiencing which was shifts and breaks in what I perceived as dimensions \x96 I felt I was travelling through time/space spinning in infinity able to experience what the universe feels like as an entity\x96 \r\n\r\nI was obviously pretty far out \x96 after some time my cousin came in the room behind me and I remember her laughing and pointing at everyone and her saying that they all looked like they were listening to Christ himself. It was at this point that I realised that everyone else apart from me and me friend at the party were born again Christians. Now I think my thoughts must have wrapped themselves in knots, I felt that my energy was being taken from me \x96 like some entity was literally taking my energy \x96my thoughts intensified as David Icke, the masons and the Christians all seemed to coalesce into one big fear dripping monster in my mind.\r\n\r\nI was unable to move rigid with fear \x96 I was gripped inside a fear so powerful that I felt I was experiencing the fight, flight and freeze mechanism all wrapped up in one. It was like the fear had then been condensed into a pill that was now wavering in front of me on the sickening tongue of Rose West as she attempted to French kiss me. \r\n\r\nI was Hans Solo frozen in the centre of the death star with the only resistance available being that of my own torn mental health. I delved into this dark energy nightmare and became utterly convinced that I had been contacted by an alien life form that uses human negativity as a stoner might use his own personal sweet shop \x96 I was being scoffed upon, drooled all over \x96 this thing was cursing through my thoughts searching for one terrifying thought after another to feast upon- and I gave to it all I had for hours- fuck man its was hard going.\r\n\r\nSo basically I spent about 6 hours locked into a ruminative cycle exploring the things I find the most terrifying like being eaten alive, or that nothing at all exists and we are all simply here to be fed upon by this intergalactic alien with the energy munchies\x96 I could go on but imagine your darkest thoughts manifest for hours and hours \x96 I felt paranoid and uncertain of everything for months after this. I felt paranoid and uncertain of everything for months after this.\r\n\r\nI don\x92t blame the substances because all they do is connect you to another level of yourself \x96 the environment changed but more important than this was that I changed my thinking and appraisals about what was happening \x96 I think this is true of all bad trips \x96 as Radiohead once sang \x91you do it to yourself you do and that\x92s what really hurts\x92. Our thoughts are incredibly powerful when we misinterpret them or when we appraise the other systems we take our cues from negatively \x96 <!-- this is the basic cognitive model or the 5 areas as its called \x96 \r\n\r\nIt goes like this - we have a situation either external or internal or both \x96 this is then appraised or made sense of in the following ways and in no particular order \x96 thoughts, emotions, physical sensations and behaviour \x96 its easy for these things to get out of hand and become a vicious cycle at the best of times and are often significant parts of issues such as depression and anxiety etc \x96 -->\r\n\r\nGranted trying to rationalise by weighing up pros and cons, or maybe cognitively re-structure what\x92s going down is made all the harder in certain situations especially when tripping. However it\x92s not impossible and I would say that the most mystical utterly beautiful psychedelic experiences I\x92ve had were no doubt because I made the right appraisals in the right environment \x96 In this situation I was stupid and flippant with my usage of a sacred substance I used in an unfamiliar environment with unfamiliar and unpredictable people. I did not set the scene and my previous reading material was too intense and too far out. Sticking with the knowledge given us by folk like Timothy Leary and Terence McKenna is the way forward \x96 the old Set and setting is always important and so is perhaps working out your own personal ritual to further set the vibrations for the sun. \r\n\r\nI have flown since but never again will I disrespect the sacred. Take care be safe and enjoy the all that is.\r\n\r\nMuch love\r\n\r\nx"
107133,Difficult but Rewarding,johndoe,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis is my third experience with psilocybin containing mushrooms. I have some experience with other psychedelics, amongst them 4-Aco-DMT, which I found virtually indistinguishable from mushrooms.\r\n\r\nAll of my experiences has been quite mild, but still felt profound in some way or another, although no real feelings of insight and no real feeling of fear (bad trips). This time I got a surprise.\r\n\r\nMe and 4 friends planned a few weeks ahead to do some mushrooms on a Saturday night. One of us had never done it before, and the rest had done it a handful of times. I was excited, but still a little tense. I am interested in psychedelics, and like to experiement, but I can easily go a full year without the urge of doing them. I have a lot of respect, and some fear of the powerful effects. \r\n\r\nThis time I was more tense than usual, because my headspace had not been so calm for a while, with stressors from school and other relations. Also I have struggled with anxiety for a number of years, although it is alot better now. Another factor was that I felt that it might be a little much being 5 or more doing the mushrooms. I considered not doing it, because of these doubts. But I decided to do it anyways and was prepared to accept anything coming my way. \r\n\r\nOn the night of the trip I was pretty calm, but I was definately a little tense about the situation, which is normal for me before doing shrooms, as well as when waiting for the effects. Some friends were a little late and we had to wait before doing the shrooms, which increased my anxiety somewhat. I sat down and ate the dose of one gram (which I considered a small one) together with my friends. I had not eaten much the whole day and my stomach was pretty much empty.\r\n\r\nThe effects startet subtly after about 15 minutes. It got intense quite fast and I was feeling pretty good. Suddenly I was feeling quite tense and a little disorientated. I had profound dysphoric feelings and felt deep anxiety in waves. I tried to be calm and happy, tried to join my friends chatting and laughing, but it felt artificial and alien. The feeling was quite overwhelming and I tried not showing (which I succeded) for fear of doing something wrong or causing bad vibes.\r\n\r\nSome friends suggested we go out for a walk in a forested area. I liked the idea, and thought it might help my mindset. At first it felt like it helped, but I was still confused and stressed. I could not feel any good sensations, and the dread just grew. Everything was too much, all the sensory inputs all the different people talking, I just could not keep up. Although I tried, and sometimes got a break where I felt happy and focused. \r\n\r\nWe sat down in the forest and talked. All my friends were apparantly having a good time, but I just could not shake the feeling of dread hanging over me, just hoping it would soon be over. I cant put my finger on what exactly bothered me, just that I felt confused and out of control. I think I might have been something with me wearing a mask when with my freinds (which I do to some degree when sober as well) trying to hide anxiety and bad emotions. So maybe it was a lesson in being honest and being myself... I dont know. Anyways I had the urge to go back to where we came from, with a feeling it would get better, although I doubted it. The way home was equally stressfull, and I looked at a friends clock, only two hours passed! My sense of time was pretty non existent but I understood that it had not been long since we ingested the mushrooms. It felt a lot longer in my head. (I realize that I probably had not reached the peak yet, and that might have been the cause of some of the disorientation, although I am not sure.) Still I am amazed with how heavy a 1 gram dose was. My friend who had not done mushrooms before did 1.2 and barely noticed anything... I am amazed with how heavy a 1 gram dose was. My friend who had not done mushrooms before did 1.2 and barely noticed anything...\r\n\r\nWhen we got back to the house, I had the feeling that the trip should soon be over, but I was wrong. I think this is when I just entered the peak point (about two hours and 15 minutes in). Some of my friends made a joint to smoke, which I did not want any part of. Me and another friend stayed inside and started talking. My head was much less chaotic now, alltough the psychedelic waves still came and went. It was easy and flowing conversation with my friend, which felt wonderful. After this the rest of the trip was delightful. We all just lay in the sofa talking about everything and anything. I felt a profound sense of connection and love for my friends, the world and myself. \r\n\r\nI feel that I learnd a lesson about being honest and being yourself. That loving one and another is the only way to true living. I think alot of people (myself included) are afraid of intimacy and feel a little alienated in this world. I got a peek into what life could be, if one lets oneself live to the fullest, being honest and kind to both oneself and others."
91669,Comparison to Other Strains,Shamanballah,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nI\'d like to start by saying that this report is a bit more specific than a mushroom experience. I get several pf-tek grown strains and try and spot out differences between them.\r\n\r\nI started out by crushing an eighth into orange juice and gulping it down. I then proceeded to smoke a couple bowls as that prepares me well in terms of mental position and nausea. We had been camping for a day now and I was already familiar with our campground. I knew where all beach and forest accesses were.\r\n\r\n00:20= I find it already difficult to read small letters and everything has taken on a bright \'alice in wonderland\' sheen. All colours are intense and contrasting which I find is abnormal this early in. This felt like the come-up of considerably pure LSD at least in the 150 mcg range.\r\n\r\n00:45= holy fucking shit. I am so fucking high and am starting to dance near the edge of not being able to cope mentally. Powerful warps of space/time are evident and walking through an \'ocean of floor\' is really hard. There is a powerful body buzz with energy coursing through to my fingertips. I think this may be the combination with the bong hits because I ate nearly all caps and very little stem material.\r\n\r\n01:15= the initial rush one feels when coming up on psychadelics is over. The confusion has leveled off to a manageable thing. I am fully immersed in my trip. The visual patterning and colours are even more profound and intricate than I\'ve experienced on golden teacher (cubensis). The visual patterning and colours are even more profound and intricate than I\'ve experienced on golden teacher (cubensis). The mental disorientation is really mild compared to some other strains I\'ve had. Blue and yellow are the prominent colours with reds and greens weaving intricately into the patterns. Patterns remind me of india, with paisley and regal floral forms. Curvy tails seem to border these much like the tails on paisley teardrops. I am also visualizing many hindu deities and religious figures such as buddha within these patterns. The closed eye visuals are intense and eyes are seen in the background.\r\n\r\n02:00= although the confusing rush has passed as the tryptamines change my mind, I am still getting higher and higher. The energy is quite intense ruling out the possibility that the body high was caused by marijuana. This mushroom species seems to have quite a heavy body load and I can feel my bodies boundaries contorting and twisting to the visual warping I am experiencing.\r\n\r\n04:00= the worst is over. Since the third hour into my experience the visual effects seemed to taper off and my mind went from very stimulated and anxious to meditative and peaceful. The intense patterning and warping turned to melting and trailing. Boundaries melded together and moving objects left wisps and after-images usually rainbow. I was enjoying this peaceful yet energetic state. I enjoyed the trails very much as I brought glowsticks for me and my friends. Music was indescribably beautiful and expanded. I picked up tones I didnt know were there in the songs.\r\n\r\n04:50= I am definetely on the come-down. Everything is gradually tapering off but my nausea came fast and hard. I nearly vomited but managed to smoke a fat bong load of the good reefer I had been saving ( green crack/northern lights hybrid) before any major gagging. I immediately felt better and passed alot of gas. However this changed the meditative high to a slightly more jarry one. The strong reefer returned the fractalization and colors as well as the strong warping. The trails weren\'t as evident now. Weed tends to enhance the visualizations of hallucinogens but dulls the effects of the hallucinogen as the reefer wears off.\r\n\r\n06:15= the mushrooms wore off surprisingly early the mushrooms wore off surprisingly early as an eighth will usually let me soar for about 7 hours at least. Nevertheless this strain is a force to be reckoned with. Highly colorful and visual with a strong body energy emanating from your heart outwards to the  limbs. Quite mind-fucking in high doses but not as bad as some other strains I have tried."
98019,"Terence, God and a  Filing Cabinet...",Ciaran Shaman,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI gently boiled and simmered around 150 psilocybe semilanceata mushrooms. Making sure to infuse good spirit and cheer into the water and all cooking aids and the receptacle. The mushrooms I also gave good cheer to, and whilst they accepted this with delight they told me that \'they were already filled with positive spirit and much else besides.\' An impish response and a portent of what was to come. The mushrooms were in a cheeky and sprightly mood...\r\n\r\nAs the divine infusion brewed, I paid attention to and arranged set and setting. I made a makeshift bed on the floor with cushions and a duvet. I lit a candle and some incense and turned the rest of the lights off. The plan was to listen to the audiobook of \'True Hallucinations\' by Terence McKenna as I journeyed The plan was to listen to the audiobook of \'True Hallucinations\' by Terence McKenna as I journeyed, and without expectation take it from there...\r\n\r\nThe scene was set. All was right. I poured the brew and drank a large cup full of hot thick cloying mushroom spirit. A couple of gags here and there towards the bottom of the cup but it gradually went down and stayed down thankfully. Terence was leading me into the jungle, this was way too exciting to be focusing on anything else such as nausea. I eagerly accepted Terence\'s invitation and began to walk with him.\r\n\r\nThe effects were slow to come on. A creeping and gradual sensation of separation from the body flesh. I can only liken it to the slow removal of a healing plaster - similar in sensation to the way Velcro works, with one layer being body and the other layer being spirit. The separation was gentle yet deliberate, with purpose. \r\n\r\nAt this point I closed my eyes, lay back and let it all go. Any residual fear or nervousness, or worries about a dark trip and the subsequent concern as to where I might go and what might be shown to me were replaced with a gratifying and welcome sense of slipping away into a place where such notions seemed meaningless, and for this trip, absurd. This trip was to be a fantastical voyage that for sure was the message coming from the other side. I could feel the messengers close by, just on the other side of a membrane that was getting thinner by the second.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how long this intriguing and sometimes uncomfortable process took. Parts of me did not want to be removed from body and there were numerous internal battles as they slowly realised resistance was futile and even they had to let go. The sensation of bliss and lightness was growing rapidly as the troublesome personality traits fell one by one. I literally dissolved into living fragments scattered through space and time - but a very different space and time to the one normally encountered in the world I was leaving behind with increasing rapidity. Meanwhile Terence took me further into the jungle and began to giggle...\r\nThe accompaniment of Terence and his audiobook - a delight which is filled with strange and complex sounds and often hilarious music which plays with Terence\'s storytelling in the truly comical, took me to places never before imagined. I couldn\'t imagine them. This colour-drenched space I was now inhabiting was vast beyond words. It was living and utterly enchanting. It was the space within information. It was the essence of information. I was shown how information is stored in utterly perplexing geometric shapes of radiant colour. Holographic in nature these \'bits\' of information were placed in a living filing system that appeared to be truly psychedelic filing cabinets made from fractal equations that presented themselves as feather-like. I\'m drawn to the radical tail-feathers of the male peacock. \r\n\r\nI watched as the constant flow of informational packages placed themselves into these utterly radical filing cabinets, and once there they would instantly, in true holographic form be everywhere and accessible to anyone or anything seeking that bit of information. There was no fanfare or grand explosion as this happened. It just did. And that seemed just right. I have no idea what the information was that I was watching being born into the world I had left behind. I was being shown the way information is managed by whatever consciousness it is that manages it. I think it is God. But it is no man, nor being as such. It is information itself, living and aware. Complexity light-years beyond our current toe-dipping into scientific discovery. Yet we can understand this complexity with ease if we open to it. Just what are we?\r\n\r\nI realised then that I was crying. I could distantly feel a wetness around my eyes and on my cheek. I opened my eyes. Glory be! The visions were much more intense with eyes open. This is unusual, I thought. The visions were much more intense with eyes open. This is unusual, I thought. The air was thick, as in physically thick, with energy. I liken the view to what it may look like if one were inside a giant clear but gloriously psychedelic jellyfish. Light was streaming in a perfect waterfall from the computer monitor that was playing random visualizations as Terence enthralled. The light I realised was flowing directly into me. Into my solar plexus. Not only that it was flowing into my cat too, who was snoozing happily by my feet. Looking around in awe I was shown that it is easy to see the \'elusive\' dark energy that currently has physicists perplexed. The force that holds the physical world together and allows it to be. All one needs to do is trust in Nature and open ones mind to her methods. I felt sorry for the mainstream scientists, trapped sadly in their own limitations of courage, imagination and scope. No-one has shown them. Why has no-one shown them?\r\n\r\nI closed my eyes and drifted to the sounds of Terence with his curious vocal style. I became aware that he has embedded parts of himself in the audiobook. Deeper than just speech. Information poured from his every word, his every giggle or exclamation of surprise. I got the distinct notion he was with me, alive and well. Blissful in his consciousness. A deep sense of life after physical death. \'It is alright\', he said in his delightful slow musical way, \'It works, look...\' I let him guide me ever further into a place so strange and alien that words at this point fail. I understood that the mushroom is alien. There is a life-form, a consciousness that has somehow managed to infuse itself into the psilocybin/psilocyn molecules and that can be accessed and conversed with simply by the ingestion of these mushrooms which are readily found throughout most parts of the world. At times this consciousness feels like God. At other times it feels like an alien life-form. Sometimes it feels like both at once. Perhaps it is. It is a grand mystery to ponder and an experience I feel each and every one of us should be able to partake in without question or judgement. It is what is missing in today\'s society. A fundamental.\r\n\r\nThe visions grew stronger... and stronger... becoming almost overwhelming. I was aware that my body was moving oddly, twisting from side to side, unable to keep still. Alternately crying and laughing. I was aware that my body was moving oddly, twisting from side to side, unable to keep still. Alternately crying and laughing. I travelled onwards through bizarre alien worlds and deeper into the workings and mysteries of the universe itself. I met consciousness awaiting bodies. People waiting to be born... They are curious, filled with delightful playfulness and eager to manifest. Bless them I thought. They should be manifesting into a glorious physical world of love song and peace, yet I knew this probably would not be the case. The money-men and power-brokers have more to answer for than they know. It enthralled, delighted and broke my heart all at the same time to meet these babies. I had not the heart to show them the world they were being born into. Their innocence was a precious gift that I had no place nor desire to take away.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed like eons I drifted... taken to fantastical places, shown things beyond literary description, meeting many different beings along the way who seemed delighted I was there and were most playful, welcoming, and eager to share. I immersed myself in the sheer beauty of it all, laughing and giggling as Terence entertained and amused.\r\n\r\nGradually and very gently the visions began to fade. So very gently. I was being delivered back to the everyday physical world by caring hands. An immersion that deep could not be followed by an immediate rushing back into body. It had to be done gently I was told, otherwise it would slip away and fade. The experience was being written to my DNA for further self-reflection and the subsequent passing on to offspring and this took time. Terence drifted, happy to have been my guide for the journey I sensed him become aware of others entering the mycoinformational realm and float towards them to begin their guiding. I got the feeling Terence McKenna is very happy and literally in his element. This feeling brought great peace and was the precursor to a slow, gentle, dreamlike voyage to the land of sleep, from whence I awoke the following day feeling refreshed, positive, and with a child-like excitement for the future."
101167,In Norway We Call It Fleinsopp,Soppmannen,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nStrong Psilocybe Semilanceata Trip\r\n\r\nI and four of my friends collected about 1500 mushrooms (Psilocybe semilanceata, in Norway we call it \'fleinsopp\'), from the fields where cows and sheeps herds. There the mushroom thrives, and it took us about 10 hours to collect that amount. We are all experienced trippers, both organic and chemical ways, and the plan was to use all the shrooms in one dose for each one of us. Considering that a normal trip dose is around 30-50 shrooms each for a very good trip.\r\n\r\nAt home the mushrooms were then put down on pieces of paper to dry, and about 70% of the shrooms\' weight was dried off the next day. I thought about grinding the dried shrooms and make some tea with it, but since the amount is so high it was easier to warm them up and make tea with them as they are. \r\n\r\nI took all the mushrooms in a stainless pot, and cover it with 1.1 litre of water (one tea cup each). I then set the stove on the lowest temperature setting, and let it warm up nice and slow, not boil, just slowly simmer up just right before boiling point. The tea and the shrooms itself dosnt taste bad at all, in fact they taste very good, so nothing was added for the taste. The cooking of the shrooms took about 10-15 min, so no heavy preperation was needed for this type of trip. \r\n\r\n15 minutes before drinking my tea, I ate about 3 grams of grinded Syrian Rue seeds 15 minutes before drinking my tea, I ate about 3 grams of grinded Syrian Rue seeds, this is the first time I used this combination with shrooms, but have done it with anahuasca before, and had done all the precautions regarding the MAOI\'s. With this, I expected the effect to last several hours longer and stronger. \r\n\r\nAfter Syrian Rue takes hold, the tea was consumed, straight away I noticed that everything becomes bright, bald and clear. I conclude that it is the Rue that speeds up the process, and also the effect of the rue itself. Then the shrooms were eaten, roughly 300 each. I tell that the shrooms can be cooked twice, but its better to eat and drink it all in one dose.\r\n\r\nI and my four friends then went out into the woods, before the shrooms takes full effect. 20 minutes after drinking the tea, I am now going up very strong, so strong that my body refuses any physical activities, and begged to lay down. I then layed down in the woods with my eyes into the sky between the trees, I see a explosion of colours and vibrance, the sunlight and the trees were melting together, dancing and painting the sky in a way that cant be described in words. We all laid there for a while, nothing was said, cause no one was capable to speak at this point. So much going on in the mind, that there is nothing to do then just enjoy the trip and experience whats happens inside and around. I knows that in a short time the shrooms will take full effect, and it would be better for all of us to go home in a more controlled environment. Not a easy task to walk in this state, and small things on the way home were almost mindblowing. \r\n\r\nSafe at home we all smoked a bowl each with some MJ mixed with a bit of ganjha, sparkled with syrian rue on the top. I would never have belived that shrooms could be so strong with Rue, in regard to what state we were entering next. The bowl of this mix boosted all five of us into a spiritual, and a very very VERY pulsating state! Small sparks of blue lightnings balls were exploding everywhere, I had not experienced this before, and think it is a Rue effect....\r\n\r\nWe all sat in a ring on the floor, no one was now going to speak a word for several hours. We just sat there, eyes opened, eyes closed. I felt I was melting in with the others, there were no individuals in the room anymore, just melting pulsating energy. As it was for I, my visuals was not even close to normal, I saw through the layers of \'dimensions\' and that all things around me were frequency lines pulsating and embracing in a matter not experienced before. It all spoke to me in a pulse so strong, that I knew I was not a physical being for a while, just pure energy. \r\n\r\nI and my friends were very spiritual before this trip day, but for two of them it was a life changing moment, and their \'awareness\' is much stronger today then it was before this shroom. Their experience that day, as they said themselves, could remind them of a DMT trip.\r\n\r\n<!-- Not so experience users, should be carefull  combinig with MAOI\'s, especially Syrian Rue, as it potents other things in your body as well.\r\n\r\n-->Peace and harmony shroom friends!"
104257,Amazing Synergy,Neroaster,DMT & Psilocybe semilanceata,"\nAmazing Synergy With DMT and Psilocybin \r\n\r\nDOSE:\r\nT0:\t\t\t45 mg smoked DMT (mixed with a small amount of Marijuana)\r\nT+30min:\t1,7 g dried Psilocybe semilanceata (about 60 pcs) taken with water.\t\r\n\r\nThis report documents my experience with smoked DMT and Liberty Caps. I am a male, 43 years old at the time of this experience. For the last 15 years, I have been a psychonaut, enjoying many different substances, but most often, LSD. For the last 5 years, I have tried to get a breakthrough with Ayahuasca, but a gatekeeper, telling me to fix my life before proceeding into hyperspace, has stopped me. I have tried to get a breakthrough with Ayahuasca, but a gatekeeper, telling me to fix my life before proceeding into hyperspace, has stopped me. The experiences have been very helpful with pushing me to a better me, work still in progress. \r\n\r\nNow I have been waiting to get hold on DMT  for quite some time, and when I had the opportunity to be hold on a gram I was overly excited. My first experience was very intense, and I was out of this world for 14 minutes, and had an afterglow that lasted for days. The trip in itself was too much and quite unpleasant. Therefore, I have reduced the amount of DMT smoked after that, to customize myself and gain confidence into this experience.\r\n\r\nI prepared myself by making my living room more accommodating, blocking all light sources from the outside and removing all in the room itself, putting on some icaros to listen to while doing this. A thick blanket on the floor, with lots of pillows to support my back when laying back, after the toke. I changed the music to some good chill out, and then meditated for 10 minutes to focus and calm myself, before lighting the pipe with my mix of weed and DMT in.\r\n\r\nOn all three of my previous attempts, I was thrown into DMT space, after just one toke, no time to take another hit (and there was not anything left either). This time however, I didn\'t manage to burn everything in one go, and did 2 tokes before the effect started to kick in, however it wasn\'t very strong, and as I lied down I was disrupted by the music, and I had to find the remote to mute it. I also found out that my router behind the TV had really strong led light that now was in my eye sights, I quickly found a pillow to put on my face to block out this light source, it helped, but by the time I was ready to enter deep space again, I felt the effect already diminishing. \r\n\r\nOn all of my trips to DMT space, I am in the same space; a family of entities are watching me, poking into me, and fixing parts of me that appears to be broken. It feels like I am in some sort of very laid back emergency room, I am the patient, and the entities are just calmly checking up on me, no stress.\r\n\r\nWhile returning to normal, I always have a period of reflection on my life and what to do in order to improve on aspect of it. Here I also experience beautiful bands of color swirling around and a presence, it does not speak, but communicate through feelings and concepts, I have tried to speak with it, but there are no straight answers, but I am given answers that I can later relate to the questions asked.\r\n\r\nNow, after returning I felt that it was just too brief a visit, and I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to wait for another hit later that night, so I decided to try some of my newly harvested crop of Liberty caps, that was dried up and grained a couple of days ago. I took my scale and measured up 1,7 grams of Psilocybe semilanceata, ate it and swallow with a glass of water. \r\n\r\nIt was about 6 hours since I had dinner, and I had only had something to drink in between, so the effect came on quite rapidly, about 20 minutes after ingesting the shrooms. 30-40 minutes after ingesting the shrooms, I really felt the body load, lied down on the blanket again, and closed my eyes. WOW, what happened here? Suddenly I was back in DMT land WOW, what happened here? Suddenly I was back in DMT land, colors swirling and a now familiar presence around me. This was not a shrooms experience, it was all DMT, it felt like the shrooms, pushed the remaining DMT molecules in front of itself, or it somehow lowered to blood brain barrier, to allow the DMT another round in my brain. This lasted for 2 hours before fading again and a more familiar shrooms experience came about. \r\n\r\nI made myself a pipe of weed/hashish, sat the sofa, eyes closed, listening to Sun Control Species, and marveled at my 2 hours of extra DMT experience while drifting in and out of the intricate of the music. After another 2 hours, I felt my mind dozing off, so I went to bed, bliss."
69813,Cubes on the Sky,Mushroomike,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nHello, my name is Michael. I am 22 years old, I\'m a born American, raised Mexican. My dad is a retied hippie now a Mexican art craft dealer and producer, my mom a Mexican Indian. I live in the USA until 5 years old and move to Mexico and live most of my life there, but I travel to both countries regularly. That\'s why I dominate some English. My record with psychedelics is brief.\r\n\r\nI\'m not so sure why exactly I start using them but I surely approach with a lot of respect. I was always aware of the stories of people going insane, losing contact with reality forever, lost souls. But for other part it was clear that this type of substance was a thing that you had to take to really know for your self, because in Mexico it\'s a great subculture around the theme. A lot of the people that introduce to the mushroom was talking about shamans and now I remember that I read some books of Castaneda years before. Here was where I really like the idea of the use of plants as medium for knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo this day a have used 3 different types of mushrooms, but none of the other 2 experiences was so bizarre and amazing as the first time, so this account is really of my first time I use mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThis was the year of 2005 in the month of July, in the town of Taxco Gro, Mexico. I was at that time working in a body art studio. My teacher by the name Oscar started organizing a trip to Cuernavaca, his own home town, and from there to Tepoztlan Morelos...that\'s a 40 min drive from Cuernavaca. In Cuernavaca the brother of Oscar, Alejandro and another friend nickname Pecas joined the search, by the morning we moved to a part of Cuernavaca named Ocotitlan, we jump fences and get in little grass clears where the cows are moving around.\r\n\r\nSo we start searching for the mushroom. For that time I really could not identify a mushroom, I mean the only way the \x93expert\x94 group was able to identify the mushroom was smelling it. Now I understand how that\'s was working, I definitely can smell a psylocibyn mushroom. Oscar was in charge of verifying my mushroom as good or bad, so you can imagine that I was a little nervous about how this was going to happen, part of my brain was aware of its scientific speech that eating a mushroom finally is a kind of intoxication, and that sort of word is tied of others like death.\r\n\r\nSo the day continued with us finding mushrooms to be able to fill a bag, I\'m still not clear about the real type of mushroom. We at that time where calling theme by the name of \x93pajaritos\x94 (little birds) but now I know that definitely there where not of this kind, I have found the ones call by this name in woods in other trip for that time a verified with a book and definitely was pajaritos. I\'m suspicious that the kind could be Psilocybe semilanceata called mongui, but the truth is that is difficult at this time to identified with precision the real kind.\r\n\r\nWe drive all the way to Tepoztlan. It was a beautiful Sunday, no clouds in the sky just a perfect day, Tepoztlan was green and totally alive. I don\'t know if you are familiar to this place at all, but I can definitely say that Tepoztlan is one enigmatic place, you can find a lot of UFO information in the place. That\'s no the impressive thing, there is a incredible structure made in the mountains and a strange force...definitely you have to be there to understand, for that time I really didn\'t give much credit to the place, it was just another place for me. \r\n\r\nWe start walking up a mountain in a dry river course, now that I think about it is pretty strange that there was no flow and it was the middle of the rain session. We finally decide to stop and eat and start tripping. I was very meticulous about how many mushrooms I was going to eat. I was going to do it gradually for some reason, probably to try to stop the madness if I feel something not right. Silly idea but I start eating some, probably more that I was aware cuz I lost the count. The trip started for me very normal and it keep the same way all the time. I was enjoying a day in the woods, was really could inside the shadows of the trees. There was really a little shine coming through the trees. I was sitting in a rock, waiting for something to happen, watching my friends going around, looking at me strange or avoiding communication every one was on there on situation.\r\n\r\nI think that the decision of using a small quantity of mushroom was a really smooth entrance to the psychedelic state of mind. I remember that I wasn\'t bored. I always feel good in the woods, so I just start listening the birds, in some moment I realize that it was really beautiful sound and was a full sound I mean every bird was fundamental to make this sound so perfect, and during the experience there are lapses where I lose yourself in the things, I just don\'t now where am I, so in one of these lapses I start hearing some strange sounds. I remember a thunder sound but very far and smooth, then was a sound of what a identified with a cargo truck, hydraulic metal sounds, then something more was on the sound range this time was more close, it was like really just above my head on the other side of the trees, and it was making a indescribable sound something between water and air, a real sci fi sound.\r\n\r\nIn that second I realized that this sounds where no normal in the woods, I mean like a thunder in a sunny day? A cargo truck? We are far away of everywhere. I start thinking what was going on. I was more in my normal everyday me that elsewhere, but strange for me I didn\'t feel scared of anything, just confused, but I thought I was just my own tripping, then I remember listening to foot steps. First I deduce it was some of my friend but with a closer look every one of theme was sitting quiet. I hear the foot steps and thought it was probably some other people exploring or whatever, cuz my friends do not make any expression of surprise or anything.\r\n\r\nSo I move away from my friends and start moving up the river course and I sit in a bigger rock and I start hearing more foot steps, but this time was definitely something that disturb me, some one was moving around me in the woods, I don\'t know how but I was aware that it was something in two feet like a humanoid. And it was looking! I could follow only his sound of moving inside all those plants, I try to look very hard, buy I start seeing thousands of eyes, everywhere, so once again a said it was just my tripping paranoia.\r\n\r\nI decide to go back with my friends, for my surprise I find Alejandro walking towards the woods and saying \x93Come on! Show yourself!\x94 Definitely I was not the only one aware that somebody was \x93out there.\x94 So this was not just my own trip, my friend Oscar decide to walk back to a little clear just down the river curse, so all we get out of that place.\r\n\r\nOnce in this little clearing everything start to fall in place and at the same time reveal, we start talking about this sounds, everybody was hearing the same thing! Someone just said \x94is a freaking alien. They are here for good, no doubt.\x94 Of course I was unable to come with nothing. It was just to strange everyone of us was aware of the footsteps or these presences, something intelligent looking at us for sure.\r\n\r\nIn that same spot in middle of our words, the sound start again, there it was clear and loud, a very rare sound I can\'t described, Alejandro was just trying to see it, wherever it was it was invisible. Oscar shouted out \x93It\'s just the wind! Come on! Forget about it.\x94 Later he told me he wast tired of the intensity of the facts.\r\n\r\nAlejandro shout back \x96 \x93you are stupid dude, that\'s no wind.\x94 This time we where in the open we cud look right to the blue sky, the strange sound just continue just like our conversation, went on other issues.\r\n\r\nAnother strange situation happened here. Just as we were sitting there in the grass talking, a group of people walk by. These people do not even see us, they pass right by us talking normally joking and all, but every one of us was waiting for some response of theme but the look like we where not there, invisible.\r\n\r\nWe continued our conversation. Oscar was talking about the last time he came here with another friend and that friend put a offering to the gods of the mountain, putting some stones together in a pile. When Oscar was explaining these actions he points to the top of the mountain and says \'What the hell is that?\' And there it was, a black hole in the sky, just like that, it was moving slowly it had an exact course with the sun in its back, I still have this clear image in my mind of everybody looking up to this thing, and I though, is this is a joke? Or what? How they are doing it? It was something different about it. I mean I do not feel it, like something real, but at the same time it was there in the sky everyone of us was surely seeing the same black hole. The hole followed an exact course with the sun making a eclipse effect. I use one of the descriptions that Alex later give about that moment, \'it was like being a bug inside a glass.\'\r\n\r\nIn that exact moment of the eclipse the time seemed to stop, the birds disappear all sound everything was on mute, the wind stop, and I hear the voice of Alex that it was just in front of me, the effect is was like in slow motion, he said \x93nothing moves!\x94 And it was true!\r\n\r\nThe black hole continued it traveling across the sky and disappear behind another mountain. We decided to go to the town and from there to home. On the way back, inside the car just before starting to get inside the principal town, I saw it bright and clearly in my right window, it was just one second and I lost sight of it, but that second has lasted since. It was a gigantic Cube but at the same time was a circle, one face has a metallic red and the other metallic blue, the size about a small car. I shout it to everybody that the thing wherever it was it was back! Now in colors.\r\n\r\nWe drive up to the center to take a look at it from a mirador (seeing place), once we enter the top where it was the town, we encounter a police check point, they were looking for somebody because they were asking for IDs. I remember that we had drugs, but for our surprise the police just pass by us, they did not see us at all. Once again we did not exist.\r\n\r\nWe park close by and jump out of the car, we where standing in a corner Oscar, Alex, Pecas and me all of us pointing to the sky and looking this cube shifter changing colors in the sky, the rare thing is that nobody was interested in our visions, the people not even look up, we where like ghosts, it\'s for sure the reaction of somebody that points to the sky that the other reaction is to look up.\r\n\r\nEventually the cube disappear in front of our eyes inside the mountains, we tried to followed but it was worthless, we never saw it again.\r\n\r\nI wonder sometimes if there are more people out there that have any similar experiences, if there\'s any place to put me in contact with to share the story. I would really like that.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nMichael."
39674,My Migraine Left,finne,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nFrom late childhood to when I was 16 I suffered from migraines and cluster head aches. I was 16 when I first time tripped on mushrooms and what struck me was I was used to the pain cycle of having a migraine every forthnight and then some period of calm and the a period of cluster head aches, well both of these had not shown up at all for several months after my initial trip. I concluded that I could only attribute it to my trips on psilocybin. I then embarked on a journey of 6 years of psychonautic exploration. From 1990-1996 I had NO migraines and zero cluster head aches. \r\n\r\nI have since then done psychedelics a very few number of times until winter 2003-04 and all of 04 I have had violent attacks of the former and the latter I then dosed my self with fresh handpicked P. semilanceata = and have had no migraines or clusters since. I am now back on track more ready than ever to preach the gospel of entheogens and chemical compounds. This need to be scientifically studied. That\'s all for now\r\n\r\n[Reported Dose: \'from 1-8 grams dried and 60 grams fresh(04)\'"
46795,Jesus Calm Me,Soulshift,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nBefore this trip I had a few experiences with mushrooms, but all the previous experiences I was also taking Zoloft. I\'ve found that Zoloft takes off the edge of tripping, also I could take very high doses without feeling too overwhelmed. This was to be my first time without Zoloft.\r\n\r\nI picked about 30 grams (1 ounce) of Psilocybe Semilanceata in the afternoon. I don\'t know any trippers so I was going to trip alone, planning the trip for the evening. I was in a period of rebellion, I had recently quit my job and spended my days getting high on weed. Even though I didn\'t feel bad about my life I was also supressing lot of crappy feelings, which probably affected the trip strongly.\r\n\r\nI ate the mushrooms as they were at about 11 pm. After 10 minutes I felt the first effects. I was playing with my dog and having fun. As the effects went stronger though I was taken over by a feeling of sadness. My life really seemed pathetic. I had no friends, the people I knew were all hardcore stoners and didn\'t really care about anything but getting wasted anymore. Me too of course. I thought about how false I\'m living my life, always playing cool and unmoved, I was disgusted with the facades. For a while I forgot I\'m beginning to trip. When I realized it I thought I\'d better try steer my thinking elsewhere, and proceeded to watch my surroundings. I was starring at a wall, and the wall was bubbling. At one point, while looking at the wall, the pattern on the wallpaper began moving in a vortex like motion. The sound was WHOOOSHHHHHHHHH!!, like a bloodrush, and I felt my consciousness being pulled with the vortex. Now I knew I\'m in for a very strong trip, the time was only 45 minutes into the trip and the effect was already very strong. I still couldn\'t completely shake the uncomfortable feeling from the beginning, it grew increasingly evident, present.\r\n\r\nThe effect was coming on in waves. Every wave was stronger and more profound, and I was getting really worried. I though about calling my friends or my mom, but decided to ride it out. I have already freaked my mom out once when she found me very tripped, and I didn\'t want to worry her again. And none of my friends has ever tripped, and they are not the baby sitting types after all. I looked at my dog and it looked worried too, which only added to the creepy feeling. The floor was now whirling violently and I began having difficult to stand up. In retrospect I\'m thinking it would\'ve been lot better if I went out before this stage (there is a beautiful cliff nearby with an outlook over the city). My place looked like a shithole, everywhere I looked was some dirty socks, newspapers, beer-bottles and cigarette butts. The air smelled like it hasn\'t been replaced for decades, and it generally was a terrible setting. Since I began feeling very weak I decided to lie down in the bed. The time was now about 1 hour 30 minutes into the trip.\r\n\r\nFrom the point I got into bed I barely remember anything. The trip was coming on incredibly hard and I soon forgot that I was tripping. I couldn\'t make sense out of anything. I remember lying in a fetus position and shaking and crying, I was drenched in sweat, driveling and convulsing. I was very very afraid. Since I lost most reference points I didn\'t really know what I\'m afraid of, I guess I just couldn\'t make any sense of what\'s happening to me. At some points I remember repeating the name of Jesus. I\'m not a religious person and by that time I didn\'t even know what Jesus means, but the name calmed me down. It was as if something took hold of me and I began begging \'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus\', and suddenly feeling relief.\r\n\r\nAfter a while in this nightmare state it feels as I\'ve had a blackout and then \'woke up\'. I didn\'t know where I am, who I am or what I am, but I wasn\'t afraid anymore. I was just watching everything not knowing what it is. After a while things began to look familiar, but I still couldn\'t place them. It was as if I\'ve seen them somewhere before but couldn\'t remember where or what they were. I saw different visions flowing before me in bubbles. I saw a cluster of mushrooms, I saw my mom and my therapist, then I saw one of my friends sitting on a chair next to the bed. I still didn\'t know what they were but they looked very familiar.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed an eternity in this state I suddenly woke up. The transition was very sudden, I woke up in an instant. The time was t +5:30 hours. In general I was very happy to be back, however I was still pretty shaked by the experience. It was incredibly more powerful then I expected. I account that mostly to the fact that I was taking Zoloft all the previous times. From the next day I developed a panic disorder, and I am still pretty messed up, 3 years later. Mostly in the sense of having difficult to form my thoughts into words and actions without a lot of focusing."
75244,There & Back,Teleportational,"Huasca Combo (Syrian Rue & M. tenuiflora), Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Anadenanthera spp.","\nI had an amazing journey last night. I went beyond the Stars and found myself in a completely different world. I was fully concious. I was able to walk around quite easily.\r\n\r\nMy journey began at 11pm Sunday 23rd of November 2008. Before my journey I ate only my normal veggie food. No yeast or aged cheese was consumed. Ratatouille, Potatoes & a quorn kiev was eaten 5 hours before this experience.\r\n\r\nI ingested 3g of Syrian Rue Powder in 6 veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 20 minutes. I then consumed 3g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powdered in 6 veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 20 minutes. The first two of these I consumed with the last two Syrian Rue Capsules. I then consumed 7.2g of Acacia Catechu bark powdered in to 12 veggie capsules. Each capsule contained 0.6g. The first two Acacia Catechu capsules were taken with the last two Psilocybe Semilanceata capsules. The rest were consumed 2 capsules every 30 minutes. All capsules were taken orally with a small amount of pure water.\r\n\r\nAt 2am a snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) & 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) was consumed sublingually. At 3am a snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) & 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) was consumed sublingually. The Yopo / Cebil was consumed sublingually using natural saliva only and was ingested only after at least ten minutes in the mouth. Upon completion of this at 3.15 am I consumed 3 organic unsalted Scottish Oatcakes. Washed down with half a pint of water. I also consumed 1 teaspoon of Organic Clover Honey every hour from 2 am until 6am.\r\n\r\nThere was no nausea. There was no purging, no diarrhea. This was a perfect journey.\r\n\r\nI was transfered from my bedroom to literally another planet. Waves of soft undulating Psilocybic ethereal ectoplasmic energy enveloped my room flowing freely from the ceiling and walls. There was a mauve / purple wall or enclosure around my bed. The ectoplasmic energy washed over me touching me very gently and very beautifully on my arms, legs and face. I was very warm and comfortable. My bedroom walls were lit only by my bedside lamp. Yet the white walls were in fact Green and Yellow latice fabric dense yet translucent. My bedroom wall showed me many illusions. I did not believe them and observed them with a silent clear mind. They were not real. This experience occurred with my eyes wide open. I was to learn that the images seen with closed eyes are not real. They are the illusion created by our own minds in order to mislead us in to introspection. But also some times the real world we live in is also not real and yet it is real. By this I mean what we see is unreal illusion. Yet beneath the illusion is true reality. With eyes wide open the true reality of my experience became profound. I was fully conscious and able to function as normal. Except this was not normal! \r\n\r\nI learnt from the universal mind.\r\n\r\nI was instructed that we can and do live in a multiverse. This is layered according to the vibrational frequency that our minds and being is attuned to. So there are people that are real there are people that are not. There are spirits that are real, there are\r\nspirits that are not. Each layer or level of this multiverse is inhabited by beings that are real and by beings that are not. In other words illusions. On our journeys we are supposed to discern which are real and which are not. Thus the destination of our journeys are determined by the ability of the seeker to understand and discern with purity what is real and what is not. \r\n\r\nAlien Vistas.\r\n\r\nAs the full effects of dmt, yopo, cebil & liberty caps flowed from me through me & from without me I had the urge to look out of several windows, There were no cars no buses no vehicles no birds no animals no people only a very alien habitation / town. This town looked like the exact same town that I have lived in for twenty three years. Except that all of the buildings were made of a golden metalic compound. There were lights switched on in the windows of about a third of the houses. These felt like they were observing me. All the stars had changed. There were very few. There was no Moon. I did not recognised any. There were some U.F.O.s stationary yet when I moved to the next room window it would or they would be there. I know now that I am at a level just below that of full interaction. My lesson from this experience was clearly a starting point for destination much higher. There are many loving intelligences in existence at various levels of reality. They are often obscured in many by the illusion of fear baesed grotesque vile hiddeous spectres. But these are not real they are like a veil or curtain masking from the unworthy the beauty behind. It was remarkable how like glass or ice these spectres fall away or shatter like dust as I ignored them with a clear mind without fear.\r\n\r\nThe true majesty and undescribable magnificent vistas can not be describe by words. It has to be experienced. I have leaned that we can all travel through the illusion of space time via entheogenic transportation. \r\n\r\nThis is the true teleportation system. \r\n\r\nBy the way the beings or being told me without words, that the purges are only for those that need to be cleansed of the accumilation of negative energy, thoughts fears and illusions. I am assured that once these are removed there is no need of purging a clear mind."

Summer Solstice 1998;7(2):31.\r\n\r\nI had taken Psilocybe semilanceata. I was outside at night in the little playground of my neighborhood, slowly coming down while watching the stars and trees--nothing special. Then I noticed my cat, who was my best partner in mushroom experiments, staring at something. I gave a look, and saw a sparkle of light. I thought that it was the eye of a mouse, when the light moved, and I saw that it was a sphinx! It was small--at the best the size of a German shepherd. But strangely, he was transparent--I could only see his outline. Then I noticed that there were sphinxes everywhere. They weren\'t moving, but I had the feeling that they held great power, just like when you see a tiger sitting at a zoo. The movement of the first one that I saw was distinctly feline. They were very beautiful, not threatening, and they seemed to be made out of the purest of crystal. I don\'t remember if their faces were feline, canine, or ovine--a combination of all three perhaps? (Their faces were not human, fortunately; that would have been scary.) I didn\'t try to communicate with them; they were there minding their own business, and so was I. I soon thought of something else, and they disappeared. -- S.H., France"
36892,A Rapid River of Thoughts,Odie,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIt\x92s a Halloween night, Im dressed up as a soldier. I just get in after trick or treating for abit, Its then around 8:00pm and I take my first 3.5gs orally but in a tea.  After a few minutes of finishing them off, my friend Whou I will Call \'X\' tells me that I shouldn\x92t have eaten so much because im real little both short and skinny and that I don\x92t know what im in for. I shrug.  \r\n\r\nWe proceed to the \'Floyd Room.\' This \'Floyd Room\', is a pitch-black room where there\x92s nothing but Pink Floyd playing sometimes other bands like The Doors, or The Beatles.  While im in there waiting for the mushrooms to kick in; Im thinking about a movie I last watched \'Apocalypse Now\' which is my favriot [Viettenam] war movie and eventually after sitting thinking about that movie, I can feel the room im in expand, It feels as if it grew about another 20 feet and all the objects in there disappear besides X and I because I can hear him giggling and breathing, I begin to grow confused as to what im feeling because this is my first time trying shrooms. I wasnt sure if I was feeling it, but I knew it had to be the shrooms. I couldnt get the smirk off my face and My mind just kept flowing. \r\n\r\nAfter the effects kick in abit more, I get a hold of what I think the trip will be like. I begin to giggle so I lie down to see what visuals I get if any, I close my eyes and nothing seems to happen, all of a sudden I feel the room shrink, so I quickly open my eyes, and in front of me it seems as if the wall moved really close to me and there were many different colors, in a plaid pattern, I reach out to see if I can touch this pattern but with no luck it just moves further away. I then notice a small stream of light coming through a small crack in the window, it begins giving off little waves of shadows through the darkness, I begin opening and closing my eyes, playing with the vibes from the stream of light and the Plaid pattern that keeps appearing. \r\n        \r\nAll of a sudden X lights a match and moves it slowly until it burns out, It boggled my mind, It made many thoughts  go through my head and my body began to feel like it was full of sand. He continued to do so, I eventually became use to it and knew how to play with the bright light of the flame. Every time the flame would glow I would try and absorb it into my body, so I could feel this warm sensation go through the entire surface of my body and my mind.\r\n\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity of playing with those matches, My reality was shattered. Another friend who will be known as \'Z\' was also on shrooms came crashing through the door and whipped on the light, I felt like I was a rat in a sewer and some kids shined a flash light on me. My first instinct was to flee just incase it was danger so I scurried underneath a desk but then after that blindness went away from it going from pitch black to flourescent light bright I came out and he was sitting there with another bowl with about three or four grams of dried shrooms in it. Him and X starting eating them so I thought to myself I think im at my peak so I began munching down as well like they we\'re potato chips. But I glanced at his watch and I found out it has been only 45 minutes and my trip had only began and I now have more shrooms in me. \r\n\r\nSo the lights go back off, and I begin thinking of things in my life, looking for answers to some things, and questioning myself with everyday questions but I think of nothing that I haven\x92t thought of before while sober. So I get my lighter out and start flickering it, Making the flame dance for me as if it was my own little friend. I called him my own little friend because I could get him to dance and move and stay however long as I pleased as well as somehow absorbing the energy it would be giving off sending that sensation through my body again. I put my lighter away because the metal on it grew too hot and I burnt myself and it scared me and sent a feeling of anxiety through my body so I sat against the wall and concentrated on breathing. \r\n\r\nMy friend then starting playing with his matches while he was doing this \'The End\' by \'The Doors\' came on. Which made me think of \'Apocalypse Now\'  again because it\x92s the intro song on that movie.  At this time the shrooms have kicked in a lot more and I remember im in my soldier costume, and that at the Beginning of the movie during this song there was napalm falling everywhere and my friend\x92s matches also resembled that, so I started breathing really fast and thinking/feeling there could be a war on the go and im part of it. So I try and control myself so I get back into my shelter(Under the desk) and I begin giggling and laughing and breathing fast because everything was so perfect and intertwining, so beautiful. [The End Playing, Me Dressed up as a Soldier, Matches being lit resembling napalm a fair bit] I felt as if I was in the movie. Every Scene flashed through my head, But soon enough the song changed, and the matches ran out.\r\n\r\nAfter about 60-90 minutes the mushrooms have started to hit me really hard, I start breathing a lot faster, shorter quick breaths. It made me worry, and made me start to think again, about everything. This time Life. Which is where my trip began to go down hill. I begin questioning life, and trying to figure out the meaning. I narrowed down everything. I made everything in life seem like it had no point or meaning, because we all die in the end. I thought it wouldn\'t make a difference if I went out and started tearing my friend\x92s house apart because the worst that would happen to me is that I go to jail, get beat up etc..etc... and Id just die in the end, which was the outcome to any situation I put in front of me, \'Id just die in the end\' so I started getting really scared at this point. \r\n\r\nAlso during this feeling up stairs people were jumping up and down banging on the floor, For some reason I think it\x92s a fight breaking out. And all these thought of life being pointless, a fight breaking out upstairs, me dying in the end is all racing through my mind. So I get up as fast as I can before I get any strupid regrettable thoughts and I race out to a half well lighted room I open a window or two, I sit down and I start controlling my breathing again. I then begin to shoot some Jack Daniels to help waken me up/(sober me up[yeah, right]) and come to realization of it\x92s just the mushroom\x92s. I then get complete control of my trip again. Then I re enter the Floyd Room and begin to controll everything I can do in reality and many of my visuals. It brought me to a calm uplifting state, From that point on my view on life has changed. I think it changed for a more positive outlook, My experience expanded my mind to an extent that I didnt even think of, not even on Acid.\r\n\r\nThe last part seemed really scary at first but when I thought about it, I came to the conclusion I actually enjoyed it, I enjoyed the thrill and the adrenaline that shot through my body while I was really scared and in attack mode(when I thought the fight broke out).\r\n\r\nAt first I thought that shrooms would resemble acid, but I was wrong. Mushrooms are much more darker and I have to have alot more self control when using them. My Mind can Expand to any unimaginable plane."
25094,Intense Trip *After* Comedown,Zeb,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Cannabis,"\nBackground: I was 24 at the time, at University, reasonably well balanced.  I\'ve smoked a fair bit of pot in my time, and had done mushrooms a few times prior to this, at doses of 75 caps (probably the turning point in my recent life, lots of hang ups were resolved in one of the coolest, most in depth conversations with my tripping friend that I\'ve ever had with anyone), then a low dose of about 25, one of 33 and another of about 50.  All of these were positive experiences, although the 25 shroom trip was quite anxious in the sense that I wasn\'t *quite* tripping, and I was feeling frustrated at not being in the zone, whilst my friend was clearly having a great time.  Overall, pretty happy with my experiments with the magical shroom.\r\n\r\nThis particular trip took place in about November 2002, a couple of friends joined me, one who I had tripped with before and another who was a good friend, but not a previous tripping companion.  The setting was good, we spent it at home, mostly in my room listening to my mushroom mix playlist on the PC and doodling, and having the occasional spliff, as cannabis definitely intensifies the trip in our experience.  Earlier in the day we had gone out to a nearby hill to collect the shrooms, and we certainly came up with the goods.  Between us we gathered about 1000 mushrooms, and divided it among the hunting party, which left about 400 for the two of us in the house, which we were going to share with the others who were going to come round.\r\n\r\nIn the end a few people bailed, so when the time came there were three of us.  We decided to take 250 in tea, with the newbie having a little less tea, which should have given me a dose of around 75 - 100 shrooms.  We were seeking that first magical experience we got on 75.  However, I got the last bit of the mug of tea, which had all the shroomy \'bits\' in it.  This may have given me a somewhat higher dose than the others, I\'m not sure.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or so, nothing much happened, and then the rushes came on - this phase is to my mind the best part of the trip, incredible feelings of happiness and a desire to dance to trancey music, so I did.  I was alone at this point as I wanted a little bit of personal space during this bit.  The main part of the trip came on, and basically, it was another wonderful experience.  Inhibitions dissolved, we were back to childlike wonder, getting really into music, pretty lights, and curiously, some dust on the stairs which was really cool.  I think actually it was more the feeling of being 5 and seeing familiar surroundings through more open eyes.  We were having a fabulous time!  I won\'t go into detail, but it was classic good trip material.\r\n\r\nNaturally, time passed, albeit veeeeeery slowly :) and a few hours later I found myself coming down with the others.  At this point, I was mentally sitting on a mountainside on a red bracken covered industrial landscape, feeling a little unsettled, as I do when I can feel all my day to day perceptual filters kicking back in. I start to feel self-conscious and avoid eye contact and so on.  A little while later, I was basically baseline again.  My friends went to bed and home respectively, and I tried to go to sleep too.   \r\n\r\nAn hour or so later, I still couldn\'t sleep, and my thoughts were beginning to accelerate, then the closed eye visuals kicked in.  I couldn\'t even think of sleeping because every time I closed my eyes I was confronted by a seething mass of slightly greenish, mucusy looking liberty caps.  Everything seemed to in some way or other to relate to mushrooms.  I attribute this phase of the trip to the fact that we\'d been out crawling around on our hands and knees intently scrutinizing the ground for mushrooms earlier on in the day, maybe next time I\'ll pick them one day and eat them on another.  It wasn\'t hellish, but it was kind of disturbing.  \r\n\r\nSo, I was beginning to get a little freaked.  I thought my heart was beating at incredible speed.  I thought I should get some sugar so I drank some cola, and tried some food and went back to bed.  But, when I tried to lie down, the pressure in my head seemed to grow and I got something akin to pins and needles all over my face, similar to the feeling I get if I hang upside down for too long, so I sat up.  This was OK for a while, and then I started feeling incredibly sleepy, and could barely stop my eyes closing.  But when I flopped down to sleep the pins and needles came back, and I was still seeing mushrooms and now some organic-geometric patterns.  This cycle of lie down until I had to sit up, until I had to lie down, until I had to sit up carried on for about half an hour and I was really getting a bit frightened, as everyone else was asleep and I really needed someone to talk to and calm me down.   \r\n\r\nI went downstairs to the toilet, this was about 2 hours after what I thought of as the comedown, and as I was standing at the toilet I noticed some little worm creature wriggling around on the porcelain.  \'Aaah, how cute, it\'s a liddle worm\' I thought.   But then I took a closer look and realised it wasn\'t a worm it was some errant pubes and hairs (it\'s a student house, we don\'t have the cleanest toilet).  Right.  So they shouldn\'t be moving, except they were, they were knotting and unknotting themselves performing a quite beautiful little dance really.  This seriously freaked me out, as my two companions were now back to normal and asleep, so why the hell was I still tripping, and tripping hard?\r\n\r\nI sat down and tried to get grounded, which was a mistake, as the bathroom floor is speckled linoleum, with lots of little sparkly bits in it.  Naturally they all started moving, patterns forming and shifting in the randomness of the sparkly bits, and at this point I knew that I was far beyond anywhere I had been before, and I was all alone in it.  If you\'ve seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it was rather like the bit where they check into the hotel and the carpet starts moving.  I thought I was going to die, stupid, but I wasn\'t really thinking straight, and I was really getting the fear.  At this point I think I swore off all drugs forever (again, I wasn\'t really thinking straight!). \r\n\r\nEventually I calmed myself by going into the kitchen, nibbling on some food and staring out of the window at the sky, as dawn was approaching.  I felt I needed to get in touch with the real world, and ignore what was going on in my head.  Slowly, this worked, and I sat in the kitchen for a while, just gradually trying to let it all subside, concentrating on rejoining the real world, and our grimy kitchen was gritty and down to earth enough to facilitate this.  Probably an hour later I was able to sleep, so I went to bed and slept.\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn\'t quite the end.  For a couple of weeks aftewards, I experienced occasional phases of altered perspective and depersonalisation, triggered by the odd perspective.  I felt altered but not actually high, and it lasted for maybe half an hour each time, so it wasn\'t just some 10 second flashback.  I actually had to leave a lecture in uni at one point feigning nausea, because I was just panicking, the physical feeling of that bad part of the trip seemed to have returned and I had a vivid experience of raging paranoia. \r\n\r\nCuriously, some non-shrooming friends have had similar experiences with occasional bouts of \'oddness\' in the past year, which doctors attributed to a possible low level viral infection, so maybe I had something like that which came at a particularly inappropriate time, and the similarity to mushrooms was what was scaring me into thinking I\'d damaged myself irreperably, but in all honesty I don\'t know.  All I can say is that it went away after about 4 weeks, only *really* bothered me for a couple of days and hasn\'t troubled me since.  At the time however, I thought the mushrooms had broken me :/\r\n\r\nI look back on it now as just a bit of an overreaction.  I think, had I been able to talk to someone experienced at the time, I\'d have been OK.  The problem was that I was alone and my mind was running in circles.  In future, I will write \'It\'s just a drug, it\'ll be over by the time the sun comes up\' on a piece of paper and use that to calm myself, and make sure that I have a trusted friend around (or at the end of a phone) who I know wouldn\'t mind talking me out of a bad place at 4am.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I\'d do mushrooms again, but less of them, and I\'d have a mug of the tea to myself so I knew exactly how much I was getting.  Mushrooms have profoundly altered me in very beneficial ways, and it would seem a shame to utterly write them off on account of one bad experience."
36715,U-turns,Botaanik,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, 4-HO-MiPT & Cannabis","\nMind state: calm, excited and have been all day in happy mood.\r\nFood in stomach: Stomach is empty\r\nSubstance\'s: 20 Psilocybe semilanceata, 15mg 4-HO-MiPT and cannabis\r\n\r\nThere are first mushrooms (Psilocybe semilanceata) growing in my area. After 2.5h hunt with 2 friends, I was able to find 20 of them. Total amount was 130 shrooms from which 20 was mine and 110 went to 3 friends. I had other things to do when they had trip. So, I ingested my 20 next day.\r\n\r\nI ingested them 20:00PM. Within 20 minutes, I was feeling first effects. I was more happy and occasionally I laughed for no reason. My motor skills were little off, cause I had trouble with balance. Body felt heavy and numb. So I lie down and watch TV. Colors are brighter and little movement in periphery vision. Textures have more depth and when I look in one point, my vision turns to tunnel where I don\'t see out side of it. I was able to do this by will. There are patterns on things and time to time one area is covered with one color (mostly red).\r\n\r\nAround 70mins after ingestion, I went outside to have a cigg. It is pretty dark now and it is getting more darker. I look up the sky and see the most amazing sight I\'ve ever seen. Sky is full of stars and it looks like I\'m in a dome. When I first saw this, a rush of euphoria passes my body. I watch in sky around 4min and then my neck starts to hurt.\r\n\r\nWhen 90mins had passed I was still at same level and I felt it is not going to be more intense than that. So, I take my 15mg 4-HO-MiPT.\r\n\r\nNow, after 15min\'s, things are getting more intense. I don\'t know how to rate my decision about taking 15mg of 4-Ho-MiPT. I guess it was not smart thing to do, but I don\'t regret it.\r\n\r\nWith another 5min, I felt that I\'m in intense ride. I think maybe shrooms did get more intense or was miprocin coming on strong. Other thing that may have contributed to intensity, is that I was already in altered state and miprocin came on too fast.\r\n\r\nIt\'s 2h after taking shrooms and 30min after miprocin. Visuals got intense and my heart was beating very fast. I also got very hot like first time and so I take off my t-shirt.\r\n\r\n--First U-turn\r\n\r\nNow comes u-turn to trip. I don\'t know why, but I was launched to uncomfortable mental space. I got worried about my heart beat and how hot I was. Suddenly, thought, that I may die pops to my head. I was able to maintain clear head and didn\'t panic. I went to my brother\'s room to tell him about what was happening. Hearing his voice was calming. I told him that I stay with him and that he talks to me. When he stopped talking, I was again starting to panic. I felt like something in my head is shrinking. Like there was something really physically happening. Little after that, I got dizziness. I went to window to get cold and fresh air. That helped and I sit down again. The time-dilation is very huge. It is worst thing that can happen to person having bad time.\r\n\r\n--Second U-turn\r\n\r\nI then started to walk around the house. I was brought by every minute to more satisfied state of mind. Soon, I wasn\'t having a bad time and started to enjoy the trip. The bad time last around 25min. For me, it felt more like hour and half.\r\n\r\nI put on some music (Pink Floyd) and it sounded relaxing and great. About the middle of the first song, I started to experience most interesting audio distortion ever. Music sounded like it has separate layers. That isn\'t the best description. I couldn\'t belive that music can sound like it did. More of, it didn\'t sound like a song. It was like different instruments was playing in chaotic order. Like they had their own rhythm that they followed. Visuals were behind anything I\'ve seen. Patterning, colors and air was full of sparkle. It was so beautiful to look different color of sparkles. My mind was racing and every thought that came to mind was analyzed in detail and in every aspect. There was random thought that came to mind, but 85% was about human nature. I made more realizations than I\'ve made in my whole life. \r\n\r\nSoon after that when I got used to trip intensity and it stoped growing, I decided to go outside to have another cigg. When I closed the door, I was really shocked. I live away from town, so there was no cars and people. Just nature. It was very dark and I couldn\'t see my own hand half meter away. Beside that, nature was so alive that I believed I saw other being\'s out there with me. Everything was alive. Was it ground, air, trees or anything. I felt like they have their own \'spirit\'. I knew that there wasn\'t nothing to worry about, cause I felt oneness with nature (I think it was shrooms that made me feel so). When I finished the cigg and admiring the nature, I went back inside.\r\n\r\nSince I fasted long time, I went to kitchen to have sandwich and yoghourt. Every bite I made from sandwich and sip from yoghourt flooded my senses with energy rush. Visual field got full of crystal clear sparkles and it felt so good to eat. I think I\'m going to eat every time I trip.\r\n\r\nI then smoke a bong of best weed I have had. This made my ability to analyze human nature more stronger. I saw my thoughts visually. Every personality quality had its own visual make-up. Every quality was torn to its real meaning and essence. I can\'t bring any specific thought I had, cause when one was finished, another was taken and there was so many of them. I say again... my mind was racing at the speed of god.\r\n\r\nThis lasted quite long time. Until I decided to smoke another bong and have cigg. When I got outside, it wasn\'t like before. Nature was still quite alive, but something was missing. But one interesting thing was that I didn\'t want to stop walking. Walking was also weird. I felt like my feet\'s are sinking to ground. Like there were little holes where my feet was falling. Being outside felt so good so I had another cigg. Looking trees (in front of city light\'s in sky) was beautiful.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, I spent my trip listening music and later watching TV. The main subject was still human nature. I experienced before one \'important\' realization about main quality/essence of human nature, but it is hazy.\r\n\r\n--Day after\r\nI felt worn out. I spent most of the day recovering from the experience. Watching TV and laying in bed. I had pain in my eyes cause whole night they were wide open. There was like void in my head. Much less thoughts than normal. Later that night I realized that I had one hell of trip. Quite annoying feeling was in head whole day.\r\n\r\n--Two day\'s after\r\nStill had this weird feeling in my head. I still tried to figure out what had happened. This trip was quite a shock to my mind.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nAfterthought...\r\nFirst, I\'m still try to figure out this trip. The first part of the trip was quite shocking. This combination was very interesting. I don\'t think I would do this again, but I\'m thankful it happened. I made so many realizations about life and especially about human nature. Even if I don\'t remember most of them, they shifted my perspective how I view the world. Visuals that I got after ingesting 4-HO-MiPT, was mind blowing. I have to also admit like many other, that this substance has the feeling of rolling. It\'s quite euphoric. I felt like the euphoria come from my thoughts and mind state. This was second time I tried miprocin and got so hot. Weird reaction. This is my favorite substance so far. This first time on shrooms gave me good picture about them. It was low-medium dose, but now I know why others like it so much. Total duration (since ingesting mushrooms) was 8h. I went to bed 04:00AM and sleep came with no problem.\r\n\r\nI wish I could remember more from the trip and that I could write much better."
9725,The Need For a Good Laugh,Don\'t fearthe Reaper,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata  & Cannabis,"\nWith my first few trips into the land of Mushrooms being less than successful, I put my self down as not a Mushroom person, so when the season for them came round I wasn\'t going to bother.  When one of my mates asked me if I would help him pick as he wasn\'t 100% sure of what he should be picking I willingly agreed (I think picking mushrooms is a laugh, even if I wasn\'t going to be taking).  So after a day of slopping about in the pouring rain we finally came back with quite a few. After trudging about in the rain all day and a prospect of a pretty dull night, I thought \'go for it nothing better to do\'.  We decided to wait until after tea to take them as it was getting late and we were both hungry. Slightly suspect of eating before Mushrooms, I had a bite to eat and proceeded to sort out my brew. \r\n\r\nFirst I boiled a cup or so of water reduced the heat to a simmer then I added the shrooms (about 100) plus some lemon for acidity (helps break down the stuff that gets you mashed), then a little bit of ginger (I heard ginger helps settle you\'re stomach) and simmered it for about 5 min then left it to sit for about 10 min, strained it and the brew was ready.\r\n\r\nFor the past couple of days I had been feeling quite ill and was not sure of how wise it was (you\'re mind set has a lot to do with you\'re trip), I thought F*** it I feel ill any way I might as well be ill and tripping.\r\n\r\nAbout 8:30 pm I drank the brew, feeling a little better after some food. After about 45min of playing Tekken 3 I needed the toilet, by the time I was back in my room I could feel it.\r\n\r\nFirst effects of it was hard to define, the lights seemed to increase in brightness, the walls started to undulate, slightly at first all most undetectable but as time wore on it increased, after about 15 min of this, every thing was undulating. I switched on my TV to try and gain some perspective of what was normal but every thing anyone said seemed too stutter and repeat them selves. After a couple of min\'s I didn\'t know what I was watching or what they were saying. I turned the TV off. Now I was in my own little reality I searched for music but could not find anything I wanted to listen too. So I sat on my own in silence tripping, with nothing to concentrate on my thoughts turned inward, I started thinking about all the things in my life that weren\'t right, all my past mistakes things I should have done (I don\'t normally think like this).\r\n\r\nI was getting further and further from where I wanted to be, the more depressed and wasted I became the less I wanted to be tripping. Just when I really started to regret taking the brew the doorbell rang, it was my mate who had helped me pick the mushrooms. He had drunk his and was having a good time.  As soon as he arrived the night improved.  No longer wallowing in self pity I had someone to talk to, someone to compare experiences with, more importantly someone to have a laugh with.\r\n\r\nThe trip improved immensely after this, I no longer felt depressed or ill, my mate spilled a whole bottle of lemonade on my bed and it erupted every where after that we started to laugh and didn\'t stop for ages.  All the worry and stress slowly dissipated the more my mind began to enjoy the trip. Every thing made less and less sense and became more and more amusing the smallest thing became a source of hilarity, cigarettes were funny, the music we were listening too sounded strange and amusing. The rest of the night was spent wandering about the town outside on a misty night (very trippy) speaking bulls**t and generally having a laugh.    \r\n\r\nI would recommend Mushrooms to any one (I never felt too ill but I have before, maybe it was the ginger, I didn\'t use it in my last brews), but only if you have someone with you that\'s on the same wavelength as you. And more importantly you can have a laugh with.\r\n\r\nP.S. Before brewing them I dried them for about 5 min in the oven at 190\xb0C. Speaking from experience this did make a noticeable increase in there potency."
40586,Mushrooms & Migraines,AJ,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI would first like to note that until I found this web-page in a google site about mushrooms, I refused to try any sort of psychedelic drugs. I began to read about the mushrooms and how they affect your body. Just before I exited the site I saw a link that said \'Mushrooms and Migraines.\'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I began having migraines when I was six. They stopped, and now I am 19 and experiencing them worse than before. I let my boyfriend convince me to take the mushrooms to help take care of my migraines.\r\n\r\nFirst I took 2 grams of mushrooms and chopped them up finely and boiled them in one cup of water for fifteen minutes. I drained them with a coffee filter and into a cup. I drank that first cup and boiled the mushrooms for fifteen more minutes in another cup of water, followed by the straining method once more. I drank this second cup and left the rest of the mushrooms in cup of water for two hours. \r\n\r\nI waited a half an hour and began tripping. This was an absolutely wonderful experience, I believe the trip with the mushroom tea is most definitely the way to go. Even for a person who just wants a good trip. I tripped so sweetly, and I was able to watch the walls and the floors melt while I watched a Color show on an Apple Computer. This was amazing.\r\n\r\nAfter four hours my trip began to dissipate, and this is where I messed up. Instead of making more tea, I just ate another two grams and waited for the effects. For someone with migraines, this doesn\'t help. \r\n\r\nI went about a month or so with no migraines, just a cloudy headache instead. Soon after I began to have migraines daily, disabling me. I got fired from my job and I am still looking. I am also a college student and am unable to attend a lot of my classes due to these daily migraines. \r\n\r\nI believe that if I had not eaten the second dose I would not have regained the migraines so badly. I am hoping to try it again someday to get rid of these migraines, but for now I am going to see a nuerologist to see what they can do for me.\r\n\r\nThanks Erowid for the idea and the directions on how to get rid of my migraines, even if it was only for a little while."
10169,Daydreaming,E.Rohde,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI\'m just going to sit here, sit here awhile and let time forget about me.  Im in this empty park that over looks the grey pudget sound.  It\'s rainy its cold its windy, it\'s beautiful it\'s the island.  The wind makes my ears like bottle tops with wind blown across, loud cold rumbling.  The sea is ceasless rolling waves that sound like passing traffic.  Autmnal tumbling leaves all red and orange gold brown  everywere causing tracers of colors I cant describe.  Crows looming and calling making me think of Poe and his poems.  All this makes me want to write this all down maybe if I write it down precisly I can capture it hold it have this feeling forever. Write about the windmill thats the concession stand all closed up with mums surrounding it swaying vibrating breathing with life. Everything is awake now no longer sleeping but its all slow and sleepy,  all the trees and the plants are yawning getting ready to go down for winter and I have broken through to there world to watch them curl and stretch watch their eyes get foggy with dreams just like mine.  \r\n\r\nBig puffy clouds look no different than the cascade mountain range below them, floating mountains all tonal gray and creamy white gliding, colliding breaking apart like iceburgs in the sky when they explode shafts of blazing sunlight scream through the sky like pillars to the gods, its all pink and gold and purple another sunset I cant describe so brillant so common.  Makes me want to swell up with it all and burst into a thousand flecks of stardust and fall into the wet rich soil and green grass and be all this that I see.  Mostly images broken random beautiful.  We think the indians that lived here knew about the mushrooms, thats what the old hippy tells me he must be a hundred years old himself his skin is like wet paper and he wears beads and lives in the woods he is witch indian magic he is my friend.  They are probably earth spirts, I can see dancing and hear singing and feel drums smell smoke and warm fire and water and crazy painted eyes.  The little people laughing and dancing in the fertile times with skin like burned brass the color of trees and grass.\r\n\r\n Circles moving echo voices,\r\n there all ghost now so sacred so intense I can feel the earth pulse in my naked feet on this wet grass makes my body beat with it. The whole world is alive and every moment speaks in some life sound all around me effaced by life I\'m deluged in my senses and even the air is intoxicaitng.\r\n To call this high would be cheap,\r\n I\'m lost for words now."
27118,Smoked Mushrooms,Necro,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nMe and a friend were sitting around one day, smoking some pot and playing on the computer. Earlier that week I had been out looking for shrooms and had found me about 50 of them, I had also powdered them after drying them. So, being our usual druggie selves we just couldn\'t keep our hands off of them, but 50 are so few...\r\n\r\nWe decided smoking them would have to be tried out, which turned out to be... Strange. At first, it felt like I was coming slightly up on the shrooms - but there it halted. In mid-onset. From there on out it\'s hard to remember things, but I didn\'t go any higher...\r\n\r\nThe very next monday was a surprise for me, talking to friends and relatives who told me of meetings with them I could not remember, places I\'ve been I have no recollection of and such. Very, very strange..."
22540,Screaming Frenzy,Doctor B,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThis report is quite long \x85..\r\nFirstly a little background information about me \x96 20-year-old male living with my parents in a small leafy town in the north of England. Early last year I was diagnosed with a schizo - affective disorder and spent a period of 6 months in a mental institution. I have been out of hospital for around 8 months now and (through the use of medication) I live a normal life and suffer none of the symptoms which got me institutionalised. Currently taking the anti psychotic risperidone and also sleeping tablets, zopiclone. \r\nI have always been interested in altered states of mind and in the past I have achieved altered states through the heavy daily use of marijuana, dxm, ketamine, caffeine, codeine and occasionally ecstasy, which a lot of my friends believe caused my mental situation as I suffered from all the hallmarks of cannabis psychosis. Anyway, I digress\x85\r\n\r\nA few months ago I was offered some shrooms by a dealer friend, and although it is common sense that a person of my fragile mind should never touch psycedelics, it thought fuck it and purchased just over three grams of what I was informed were liberty cap magic mushrooms. I know some people will wonder why I would risk my sanity for the sake of a mushroom trip, but the honest answer is I don\x92t really care! For me, suffering a mental illness wasn\x92t all bad, apart from a profound paranoia, I was just a happy go lucky soul oblivious to all world around me, and to this day i remain a happy person. My philosophy is simple \x96 I\x92m going to die one day so I might as well have as much fun as possible in before I croak.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I had to wait a few weeks until my parents had gone on holiday before I could trip, so I spent the time reading Erowid\'s trip reports and generally just learning as much as I could about the shrooms.\r\n\r\nEventually the time came for my parents to go on holiday, so I was left with only my older sister to deal with. My sister is an air hostess and works long hours, so when I found out that she was working on the Saturday after my parents went away I knew that was the time to trip.\r\n\r\nMy sister went to work at some godawful hour in the morning and wasn\x92t due home till around 6pm, so I invited three friends (whom I will refer to as S, W, and A) round to accompany me while I tripped. These people were actually my workmates, not my usual gang of friends, but we had been meaning to get together for a while and I thought this was the perfect opportunity to do it.\r\n\r\nThey arrived around 11am and we spent an hour or so drinking beer and just chatting, when I decided it was time to drop the shrooms. My friends all advised me that I shouldn\x92t really be doing it, but they knew that once I get an idea in my head there\x92s no changing my mind. Reluctantly, they agreed to sit for me while I tripped.\r\n\r\nAt about 12:30 I ate all the shrooms, chewing then swallowing, and I actually quite enjoyed the taste. I got myself a beer and sat back and waited for the show.\r\n\r\nAfter around 40 mins I suddenly tipped over from a sitting position onto my side, and that\x92s when I realised the shrooms had kicked in. Much to my friends amusement I had lost nearly all control of my body, I sat and giggled insanely whilst unable to sit up straight. I was astounded at how suddenly the effects had come on, but at this early stage I wasnt experiencing any visuals, I just felt heavily drunk. At this time I was sitting on the floor of my bedroom, S and A were sat on the bed and W was sitting in my chair. They were all quite drunk. The next thing I remember is I was suddenly sitting on my bed and S and W were now on the floor. 30 minutes and passed and to this day I have absolutely no memory of that lost half hour.\r\n\r\nAs I came round  I looked around I noticed that everything had taken on a green and red outline, which looked exactly like one of those 3D pictures you need red and green 3D glasses to look at. I was tripping hard. As I was talking to W his eyes started to move around his head and his facial features exchanged positions, his eyes were on his jaw and his lips were on his forehead. This amused me greatly and I was enjoying it immensely when W lost all colour and turned black and white.  I was thoroughly enjoying the trip up to this point, but things quickly went downhill\x85\r\n\r\nI remember sitting on my bed and getting increasingly annoyed at the music that was playing, so I got up and went and turned my stereo off. Just as I had re positioned myself on the bed, the music started again and I had to get up and turn it off. This annoyed me greatly as i thought my friends kept turning the stereo on, but I learned later that I had hallucinated the whole thing. The saga went on for about ten minutes as I repeatedly turned the stereo off only for it to start playing again. This eventually stopped happening and I was relieved. The trip was becoming a bit intense. I became very offense, insulting my friends then immediately apologising afterwards. I felt my mind split into two separate personalities, one evil and one good. The evil side of me kept calling W a fat bastard and then the good side of  me would immediately apologise and blame it on the evil side. I was genuionley horrified that I was being so nasty to my friend, but unfortunately I had no control over what I was saying. Thankfully my friend was cool about it and he knew what I was doing was due to the drugs.  Again, I completely zoned out for another 10 minutes or so. \r\n\r\nNext thing I knew I was stood in front of the bathroom mirror screaming at my self and laughing uncontrollably as my face morphed into that of an old man, then back to a young child. I clambered into the bath and lay there for a few moments. Suddenly I became intensely paranoid that my sister would soon be home any minute. I was a gibbering wreck, in no fit state to deal with my sister! I asked S the time and he informed me it was about 2:30. A entered the bathroom and she immediately enquired as to why I had a trickle of blood running from my nose, to which I had no reply and I still have no idea where it came from. Again  I asked the time, about 30 seconds after I had last asked. I had no concept of time, and for the next hour or so I was asking my friends every few minutes what the time was. I was becomingly increasingly distressed and at one point I punched S in face, which was a bad idea considering he is 6\x926 and about 19 stone! Thankfully S realised that the shrooms had fucked me up and I couldn\x92t control myself, so he didn\x92t retaliate or hit me back. I am so relived to this day that I had such understanding friends, because with the wrong bunch of people things would have gotten very ugly.\r\n\r\nAfter the punching incident, my friends decided that I needed to lie down and chill out. S and W went downstairs to smoke a joint, while A helped me into bed and sat with me. She sat andf stroked my head while I tried to explain all that was going on in my head. I felt an intense affinity with A, and I felt incredibly connected to her, as though we were the only two people in the world and we were brought together at this place by fate. After the trip A and I started dating, but we only lasted a few months.\r\n\r\nAfter about 30 minutes A left me to rest and went downstairs. I remember lying in bed with my eyes closed, yet all I could see was a riot of colours and lights. At this point I became very introspective. I experienced some very profound thoughts, and I suddenly became very insightful. I remember having a conversation with some mystical being. We discussed my mental health problems and the voice explained to me that I shouldn\x92t be ashamed of my problems and that if I accepted who I was then I would be peaceful. This \x91being\x92 helped put to rest a lot of my inner demons and made feel comfortable with myself.\r\n\r\nI must have eventually fallen asleep and was awoken at about 5:30 by my friends who were leaving. I was still tripping at this point and I felt the need to go outside. After my friends left I had a walk up to the local playing field where some of my other friends were playing football. The whole world was distorted and everything still had the green/red aura around it.\r\n\r\nI was having a lot of fun now, and I spent the rest of the evening chilling with my mates lying in the field explaining to them what I was experiencing. At around 8:30 I went home. My sister was back and she enquired what I\x92d been doing all and I told her that I\x92d had a few friends round and I\x92d got slightly drunk. She (and my entire family) strongly disapprove of drugs, so I omitted that part of my day from the story!\r\nAt about 9:30 I was feeing very tired so I went upstairs and got into bed. I must have drifted off immediately because that is my last memory of that day.\r\n\r\nThe next day I felt relatively normal, although I noticed my senses were slightly heightened and colours were brighter than usual.\r\n\r\nA few days later I spoke to A,S and W and they told me that I had frightened them greatly to the point of them nearly taking me to hospital. Apparently I had been in a drug frenzy of epic proportions!\r\n\r\nIn summary, I would say this had been a good trip. Although I had some frightening experiences, it was all worth it for the good experiences I had. I believe the shrooms have made me a better person and am thankful for the help of the mysterious being who helped from a bad trip into a good one. \r\n\r\nAs a final note, I was unsure as to whether my anti psychotics would affect my trip, but I don\x92t think they did.  If you are person who suffers from mental problems perhaps shrooms aren\x92t a good idea, perhaps I was lucky that they didn\x92t fuck me up completely but personally, I would risk my sanity again."
7238,Tent tripping,Anonymous,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nAt a camp last week in Somerset, England, I embarked on a shroom trip with two friends.  This was my first proper mushroom trip as before I had only smoked them providing me only with short buzzy experiences.  \r\n\r\nWe had 4.5 g dried of Psilocybe semilanceata, and took roughly equal doses.  I made sure I was no longer stoned from some canabis smoked earlier as I wanted to fully experience the coming up.  We kept brewing the shrooms with tea in a saucepan until most of the psilocybin was consumed.  We then chewed on the remaining shrooms.  The brew did not taste as bad as expected as the taste was covered by the tea.  Our trip begun in an abandoned caravan just off site.  After the brew I started to feel strange and light-headed almost immediately.  I think my friends were coming up faster than me though, as their pupils were already huge at this early stage.  They had become extremely energetic and violent towards the caravan and had begun kicking at the old metal.  One of them had begun shouting \'You cocksucking motherfucker you!\'  (his little phrase for the entire of his trip!)  I could feel myself coming up properly now and just lay on the old matress laughing hysterically at my friends.  The caravan appeared to have enlarged and become a huge hall, and the cracks in the floor formed intricate patterns, like celtic crosses. \r\n\r\nThe caravan began to feel unhomely, though, as my friends both injured themselves when they broke a window and the ceiling seemed to be caving in!  We became so paranoid about this that we ran screaming for the door!  Although it was paranoia, it was a pleasant, hysterical fear.  It made me feel like a little child again!\r\n\r\nThe most unpeculiar feelings came when we were back on site.  The grass was at first an eerie bright green and seemed to glow.  When I concentrated on its colour it turned yellow, and started coming closer to my face although I was standing upright.  At the time it was very funny.  I then started to really trip out.  A very trippy song came into my head that I cannot put a name to and I started to slip away from reality.  It was as if I was trying to discover reality but could not find it.  I became paranoid I would remain like this forever.  After a while I realised that I had not lost touch.  I began to believe that for the first time in my life I was using all of my brain.  I had become a higher lifeform.  I imagined energy flowing from my fingers in blue patterns.  I felt like a god.  I began to have extreme energy rushes. And the tune in my head became louder.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later when I had come down a little bit, my friends and I were squashed in a tent with a few other people smoking cannabis. (I had none so as not to spoil the mushroom effects).  The more violent of my two friends (I would like to point out that he is not usually violent) began burning someone\'s hair who was not tripping.  She became so annoyed she poured the bong water all over him.  I am sure now that if we hadn\'t hidden his knife earlier, she might be dead and he in prison.\r\n\r\nI more or less came down to earth three hours later.  The whole trip had lasted around four hours.\r\n\r\nThe after effects were quite weird and lasted for the rest of the day.  We sat in my tent with the most weird converstaions I have ever participated in.  Every now and again I would get these little rushes that made me excited I was coming back up, but as soon as they begun they finished.  Eventually I went to sleep and did not dream.\r\n\r\nNext time I will increase the dose to 2 g of P. semilanceta at least!"
6318,They Demand Respect,Haddock,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nIt was Saturday 7 of April and I met up with my closest friend whom I had not seen for a number of weeks we had some alcohol and hash and decided to take some magic mushrooms (from N. Ireland) which I had stored in some organic honey.  It was difficult to measure dosage so a few teaspoons per cup of tea was to do the trick.  We drank it down and noticed effects within 30 min.\r\n\r\nThe effects were confusing and frustrating, however within the hour we had settled into a very intense trip with short-term memory lapses and visuals etc. that are common in decent trips.  A few hours passed and we began to feel like coming down so we smoked a few bowls of hash.\r\n\r\nAll was going well until I felt all the blood-vessels on my neck dilate and pulsate in a very distressing way I asked for my good friends hand to help calm me (it was just the two of us in my flat at about 3:40am) but something was pulling me away from the physical world and my vision closed up and I sank deeeeep into my brain and away to another place.  An intense rush of visuals and emotions followed and I felt as though something was communicating with me..... my vision opened again to the sight of my friend screaming into my face to \'stay with me\'.\r\n\r\nWe decided to get some air and go outside (I wretched on myself) I stood up and collapsed next to the door in the room and fell away again I briefly saw myself from about 2 meters away in a state of seizure with my throat extremely pronounced and dilated.  I again came to as my friend helped me up once more but this time I hesitated as I wanted to go back to find out something and I repeated to my friend (who was now in a serious state of shock) that \'its ok its ok its good\'.\r\n\r\nI made it to the top of the stairs where I was launched into the cosmos once more where a 1000 images and emotions blasted through my being.  The most predominant one was of a fish like embryonic creature that wasn\'t separate to me but was everything that I know or could know-past, present, future..... everything.  I can\x92t explain what IT was but it was not negative but was very otherworldly yet with a distant familiarity.  This sounds like bollix but I cant really understand what I felt/saw.\r\n\r\nWe made it to the cold bathroom where I regained myself however my mate and I were very traumatized for another few hours as we tried to piece my mind together with another friend who thankfully and randomly called by after the clubs.  I shall never forget this and will be far more careful and respectful of the Shrooms in future as during one of the \'seizures\', my friend said that I did not breathe for about 1min.  It is also worthy of note that I had been taking St. John\'s wort for depression for about a month. Thanks for reading this and take care."
8869,Smoking Two Different Species,Fenno-Aapo,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & Hashish,"\nNever thought I\'d be posting experiences here, but I ran into this \'Smoking Magic Mushrooms\' section and the plea to submit a report... \r\n\r\nIt was earlier this year (2001), still snow everywhere when I was at this small private rave when a friend asked me to come and smoke some hash. He also had some leftovers of Finnish psilo (which are semilanceata I think), VERY LITTLE, one mushroom measuring about 2cm length, and bits and pieces at the bottom of a paper bag (I\'d say around 0,1 grams). He added those to the hash-tobacco mix, and we went outside and smoked. There were four of us smoking. Suddenly, we were all giggling about at nothing, I wasn\'t stoned at all, and it felt like my brain was busting out of my head! So I just squeezed my hands tight around my head, bounced around the place, laughing, giggling. After a little running around the house, I sat down, still holding my head, and wondered (or wandered) a bit, feeling radiant and glowing. After about 20-30 minutes, all the effects were gone. But yes, there were NOTICEABLE effects. This was my first experience with mushrooms (I had eaten some before, with no effects).\r\n\r\nWell, time flows like a river, and we\'re in the beginning of this (2001) June. I\'m DJ\'ing at a forest-party in the southern parts of Finland, and had acquired some Mexican psilo (got no idea what species). I had no idea what to do or what not to do with those, I never believed I\'d live to see a Mexican mushroom, and there I was. Smoking Mexicans, once again with hash, once again a very small dose (0.1-0.15 grams), once again four of us, and once again, I didn\'t get stoned at all, but it was SO DIFFERENT from the Finnish psilo. My mind went very sharp, I felt like a razorblade, able to cut anything, solve any problem; a troubleshooter, a private eye or something. I didn\'t get giggly at all, it was very serious and straightforward. The effects were not strong, but somehow my soul was totally lost in the feeling. I smoked more \'shrooms two times at the party, each time doubling the dose, which after the last time lead to a lot of schizo-activity and complete fucked-upness (like jamming a candy in my left ear with my right hand, after a two minute call of nothing to say to a friend who was sleeping...). One thing I noticed, I was SOOOO tired before the party I thought I couldn\'t handle it, but the mushrooms took that tiredness away. I kept on going and going for 12 hours or so after the last smoke, and I stayed and helped the organizers clean up the place.\r\n\r\nSo, I had effects from smoking mushrooms, two different species of psilo from two totally different parts of the world. Next thing I\'m gonna do, is to dry some Amanita muscaria, which is the best known and most frequent mushroom around here in Finland. Going to smoke it, I\'ll let you know later how it worked...\r\n\r\n<!--Edit the text to your liking, or mail me at kulma@nic.fi (please don\'t enclose my email in the text if you put this in the vaults) if you\'d like some more info or have questions.

221,The Right Amount of Mushrooms,Arlington Shroom Man,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nAfter a rather successful mushroom picking expedition into some local pastures, my friend and I decided to try a test sample. Giddy with all of the acquired mushrooms (4 1/4 lbs to be exact), we eagerly placed about a pound of wet liberty caps into a cauldron-style pot of boiling water. We let the tea continue boiling for 30 minutes. At the end of 30 minutes, I took a potato masher and smashed the mushrooms into the bottom of the pot to further extract their juices. The whole mess was then filtered through a large paper towel-lined colander to remove debris. What was left was six coffee cups full of tea so dark one could not see an inch into it. \r\n\r\nWe each drank three cups right in a row. Within ten minutes of finishing my last cup, I could feel the psilocybin invading my body. It started in my stomach as almost a tingling sensation and progressively spread out through me. By the time it reached the tips of my fingers, it felt as though my muscles were all being involuntarily flexed. My cheeks became rosy and my eyes lost all color. I thought about every minute thing with incredible intuitiveness. In my euphoric state, people amused me. Simple actions and mannerisms seemed so foolish and unimportant. It was almost as though I felt like some higher being, like a god. I wanted to help people understand how trivial their lives are, I wanted them to see the bigger picture and to be as at peace as I was. I rarely spoke during this time, it seemed like the English language could not allow me to express what I wanted to get across. \r\n\r\nAfter about six or seven hours, I fell into a sort of numb stuper which can be best described as dreaming while awake. Ever since this experience, I have looked at things differently. The way people act amuses me. Advertisements and marketing strategies seem comical and stupid. Even more comical is the media and the way that people follow its lead like a herd of cattle. I would not recommend this large of a dose for any but the experienced tripper and even to them I give warning. My experience has changed my way of thinking forever."
4218,Mushrooms & Cluster Headaches Comments,Flash,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\n(see also <A HREF=\'http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_medical1.shtml\'>Mushrooms & Cluster Headaches)\r\n\r\nIt was that time of year again. Had started waking up in the night with sore head. Felt blocked up all day and had some background pain. First couple of 1/2 hour long #1s arrived and I new it had come back...... so I dug out my supply of Liberty Cap (preserved in Honey) and boiled up a batch of 12 for 10 minutes. Drank solution slowly over 1/2 hour period and on full stomach. \r\n\r\nLess side effects than usual, no feeling of uneasiness this time (must have been the full stomach). Head suddenly cleared 2 hours later (well behind schedule, must have been that full stomach). Didn\'t realise how bad my head had been till it got better.\r\n\r\nFelt pretty good. Stayed up quite late and watched some TV. Next day felt slightly detached from reality, but nothing serious - was in good spirits.\r\n\r\nCluster completely terminated there and then (am Writing this 3 weeks later).\r\n\r\nFrom past experience that single dose is all the treatment I\'ll need for the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nWho said life had to be hell with CH? Wish my doctor would take an interest - perhaps then he could help some other poor bastard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNov 8, 1999:\r\n\r\nWhen I was younger and still using Pot I found that it made the headaches worse. As did drinking and smoking. I avoided taking hallucinogentics during episodes because I was scared that combined with CH they might kill me! The strange thing was that I didn\'t suffer from an CH episodes at all the years I took LSD. That\'s what initially made me suspect there may be a link.\r\n\r\nLSD is the sister drug to both Ergotamin and Methysergide. LSD also contains an Indole ring structure. According to Dogsbody IMITREX is a substituted indole - a sulphonated form of the well known hallucogen DMT, di-methyl triptamine. Now the substance Psilocybin that is found in some magic mushrooms (not Fly Agaric, although it may contain other similar chemicals) is also based around an Indole Ring. Psilocybin is metabolised into Psilocilin, and that substance is almost identical to Serotonin in structure.\r\n\r\nThe effective dose of Psilocybin is 10Mg. The effective dose of LSD is 0.1Mg. Both substances appear to work equally well, although your mind can tolerate the higher dose of Psilocybin (LSD gives you more bang for your gram).\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of similarities between Psilocybin, LSD and those drugs used conventionally to treat CH. The only difference is that Psilocybin and LSD are much more effective (and probably safer in such a small and infrequent dose).\r\n\r\n November 08, 1999\r\n\r\nI think what we need to do here is to gather up to date stats on the both the effectivenss and risks of using Psilocybin/Psilocilin to prevent CH.\r\n\r\nSo far I have only spoken to one acute sufferer other than myself who has used the treatment. In my case I have been using it (or LSD) for 8 1/2 years and it has been 100% sucessful in preventing CH. The other person has only used it once (recently) and again it was 100% sucessful.\r\n\r\nIn the guestbook there is a guy called ROB who used LSD for 14 years. He reckons it was 100% successful when he was episodic, but doesn\'t paint a complete picture of the duration of relief it brings now he is chronic.\r\n\r\nGetting info on the risks should be easier. As far as I am aware the risks are extremely small for this magnitude and frequency of dose. The stats on deaths from LSD and mushrooms should be fairly easy to track down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 01, 1999\r\n\r\nLiberty Cap mushrooms contain a strong hallucinogen called psilocybin. This substance is effective against CH and possibly migraine. Liberty Cap mushrooms are currently in season in the UK.\r\n\r\nI strongly recomend consulting a pictorial reference book before seeking out these mushrooms. There are only a handful of fataly toxic mushrooms in the UK and none of them resemble Liberty Cap, but it is better to be safe than sorry.\r\n\r\nIt is illegal in the UK to be in pocession of processed (including dired) Liberty Cap mushrooms. The law can be circumvented by preserving the fresh mushrooms in honey.\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms can be ingested raw but this may cause stomach pain and flatulance. The preferred method is to boil the muchrooms for 10-15mins then strain them out and drink the water.\r\n\r\nThe effective dose is around 10-12 mushrooms (around 1/4 the recreational dose). Ingest slowly over a 30 minute period to avoid unwelcome side effects.\r\n\r\nA single dose can provide protection against cluster episodes for 6-12 months. I don\'t know how well it works on chronic sufferers.\r\n\r\nThe dose may be taken at any time including outside cluster episodes.\r\n\r\nPsilocybin is chemically similar to LSD. LSD is an extract of ergot as are ergotamine and methysergide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 21, 2000\r\n\r\nI haven\'t visited for a while, now that my CH is under control there is less incentive for me to check the board on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the consensus is that we\'re on to something. Now we have to find a way to take it forward... people with MS have been battling for the last 20 years to have cannaboids prescribed to them. \r\n\r\nI\'ve noticed that those who have used the treatment or those that take it seriously don\'t make any jokes about it. Now I\'m all for a little humour but I think in this case it may undermine out credibility. In order to keep the discussion serious I suggest we refer to the active ingredient by it\'s real name - Psilocilin, as opposed to using the \'S\' word. Remember that Psilocybin is metabolised into Psilocilin and it is this compound that is closest to Serotonin.\r\n\r\nAnother problem we face is that making people aware of this is likely to end with someone getting hurt. There are scores (pardon the pun) of fungi that contain Psilocybin and Psilocin, some of them are stronger than others. Some deadly fungi (especially in North America) look way too similar.\r\n\r\nI have always concentrated on Liberty Cap because it is easiest to identify, and nothing looks too similar to it. However the picker must be objective about this - if someone is desperate to locate a particular species they may end up picking something that looks \'close enough\', and that is too close for comfort!\r\n\r\nAnyway, for the record, this is what I know. In condensed form.\r\n\r\nAround 48 Liberty Cap is of similar strength to a street dose of Acid. Liberty Cap is a weak fungus. To treat my episodic CH (2 episodes a year before I started treating it) requires a single dose of 10-12 Liberty Cap. Please remember that it can take 3-4 days for the body to metabolise all the Psilocybin into Psilocin. Liberty Cap contains no Psilocin.\r\n\r\nEating the mushrooms raw is dangerous, they can contain parasite eggs that may damage the liver. Eating the mushrooms when cooked gives you the worst and most painful gas ever. I recommend boiling for 15 mintutes then straining out the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms can be stored by preserving them raw in honey. This way they stay potent for longer.\r\n\r\nAt this dosage there should be little or no psychoactive effects, other than a slight feeling of unease or dread. To get around this I ingest the solution over a 30 min period.\r\n\r\nDon\'t use this to treat individual headaches, it is a preventative! Taking during a headache will put it away, but there may still be shadows or even mild headaches for the next 48 hours. After that everything should clear up.\r\n\r\nThe active ingredients are ineffective if the treatment is taken more than once in the same 5 day period. In my case the single dose will prevent CH for over a year.\r\n\r\nA serious problem is that this is illegal.\r\n\r\nPeople who have taken this without prior experience, are going to act like this is the most wonderful thing ever, and a cure for all their problems. You know the type of thing \'When you\'re high you never, ever wanna come down\' and so forth. This wont to the cause any good.\r\n\r\nWe also need some good hard stats. I don\'t think this treatment works for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis charge of $30K for research study isn\'t a huge amount of money. I personally could pledge $1000. Speak about putting your money where your mouth is."
4217,Using Mushrooms for Cluster Headaches,Flash,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\n(see also <A HREF=\'http://www.erowid.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms_medical1.shtml\'>Mushrooms & Cluster Headaches)\r\n\r\nFirst I eat a large meal, then I wait 2 hours, this prevents stomach upset and excess gas. Next I extract 12 mushrooms (the standard recreational dose is 48) [erowid note: this is done in the U.K. and these mushrooms are\r\npsilocybe semilanceata] and add them to a saucepan along with 1 cup of boiling water. I boil the mushrooms for 5-10 minutes (the illegal part) then strain them out and bin them. Next I consume a large glass of whiskey. The whiskey both induces a headache, and eliminates any feelings of apprehension caused by ingesting the Psilocybin solution.\r\n\r\nFinally I drink the solution slowly, over a 15 minute period, to prevent any disorientation. The mushrooms kick in when the headache is going full blast. There is a sudden feeling of \'ooh that\'s better\' and then no more headache.\r\n\r\nNo more headaches for at least 12 months in my case. There are no psychosomatic side effects to speak of, apart from once when I had a giggle fit..."
2095,My Mushroom Hell,Columbus,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nWell, every two weeks there is this huge event in a network of arches (basically tunnels) under a bridge somewhere in London. I can\'t name it for obvious reasons, but it\'s basically ONE BIG TRIP. It consists of a weird, acid-induced play, a few chill-out/trippy/gallery/art rooms, and a huge network of dance floors playing booming trance, ambient, techno .etc. The whole event is a sort of tribal gathering, decked out with various psychedelic forms of art to add to your trip (in one particular room, they were spinning some kind of flourescent spider web for the entire 24 hours) There is a stall in one of the rooms selling every psychoactive drug under the sun (provided it was legal, or relatively legal(whatever that means)), and one particular evening I was particularly hungry for that type of thing. I went over to the stall, intent on buying some magic mushrooms (I had heard they were particularly good, but had not yet tried them). I bought 5 grams for \xa320, and as they were small English liberty caps, I happily munched them all away in about ten minutes. 15 minutes later I had a joint, and stage one of the trip began.\r\n\r\nIt started as a really relaxing and pleasant trips. Colours danced and disappeared, passed through skin, and twirled around my head. Music was visible, floating through the air in spirals and circles, almost touchable. I was watching the play at the time, and everything that was said seemed to mean so much to me, sometimes even directed straight at me. I was transfixed, amazed by this new world I was entering, and was furiously chewing the sleeve of my shirt. Time passed and didn\'t passed - minutes passed me by like hours, and stage one seemed to last so long. Stage two began when a friend of mine left, and everything became more intense. Geometric patterns appeared everywhere, and faces were moving and warping in ways I had never experienced on shrooms before. I began to write down thoughts and quotes from the play, but the pen I was using seemed to be doing it all itself, the ink flowing uncontrollably from the metallic tip. I could not focus my attention on any one thing, everything was so powerful and interesting. Sound and light and taste was so beautiful, even touch, when I held a cigarette, was a magical, different sensation. Then the walls began to move, convulse and change shape - holes appeared and disappeared, colours melted and reformed, shapes danced to any sound that I could hear. i felt trapped, enclosed by a pulsating organ - I had to get out, especially since I really needed the toilet. But for some reason I forgot why I had left the theatre and found myself by the mushroom stall again preparing to buy yet more mushrooms (How stupid can somebody be, man!) In my hand, I had a water pipe, from which I had smoked a gram of Salvia during stage 2 of the psilocybin trip, one book on Tudor England, another on European history in the 16th century, and a normal dope pipe. Don\'t ask me why.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I felt something horrible, somebody\'s legs twitching against mine. It was an acquaintance of mine, somebody who had come with me, in the middle of a seizure. The mushrooms were too much for him, and his body had given up trying to cope with what he was seeing. (the next bit is pretty nasty, so hold your stomachs!) Suddenly a fountain of orange vomit errupted from his mouth and poured itself all over his face. He got up instantly, completely out of his trip, not knowing what had happened, and wondering what the hell was all over his face. His body had expelled the psilocybin, unable to deal with the utterly intense power of the trip. The rest of us entered into the next stage, the stage of complete and utter terror. I remember repeated over and over again \'Bad Karma, man, Bad Karma!\' I had to leave. All the people who had taken the mushroom were experiencing the same thing, the same intense terror. The crowds became one big, overwhelming entity, standing against me. I don\'t remember what happened next, except that I ended up in the toilet, feeling trapped and claustrophobic. My urine left my body like it was terrified too.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had finished draining myself, I rushed out, even more terrified than before. I was greeted by a juggling friend of mine, who began to juggle and immediately lifted me out of the pit I was in. If you have ever seen contact juggling, you will know what I mean when I say how amazingly beautiful it is. When I was satisfied, I left him to find some water. Things went bad again - everyone was against me, laughing, pointing, trying to kill me. I reached the water tap, and drank as much as I could, but the taste was unimaginably bad. When I looked around me, It looked as if I was standing a lake of putrifying, horrible water - I was drowning. I ran, followed by my friend and found back in the theatre. I found another companion, and sat down, ready to experience the visual power of this incredible trip in more relaxed surroundings. My mind was lost and found, tumbling and holding on. The play became my trip, it controlled how I felt, what stage I was in. When something was going wrong in the play, something was going wrong in my trip. Faces deconstructed and reformed in different ways, like a picasso painting. Some people, who were clearly experiencing just as intense trips as me, seemed to be home to maggot, hundreds of maggots writhing under their skin, stretching the skin in the most distressing way. This continued for 5 more hours, before I could leave the theatre and get something to eat. My body was completely drained, but I felt gratefully, almost euphorically happy. I would go back the following fortnight, and experience the whole place again. Another world in the middle of the metropolis that is London."
2082,The Combined Mind,Nick,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nThe previous time I had taken mushrooms in a similar setting I had not dealt with the whole thing very well. It had been too overwhelming, too powerful and I had felt inclined to stop myself going mad. I was far too tense, but I had learnt from this. I needed, if I was going to cross the threshold, to let go, to forget my ego, let myself see what was on the other side instead of constantly trying to pull away from it. I find that the setting adds considerably to the content of your trip. I had been to the same place twice before, a 24 hour club that incorporated a play, some dance floors, a vast expanse of chill-out areas (many were shoe-free, alcohol-free and tobacco-free zones, which didn\'t bother me), a sort kind of street decorated with shop upon shop, which, as the evening progresses, becomes a central focal point to meet people or regroup. The whole thing is set in a mass of tunnels, usually used as car-parks, but which, for one night become another world. It is not so much a club, but more of a plain, a community which exists by the outside world but not with it. Once you are in, it does not feel like anywhere, and yet you are there. For me, it is heaven, a heaven with bad bits and good bits. The tunnels are virtually bear, and the only things that hide the crumbling brick and cement the place is made out of are the psychedelic stalls, painting, decorations, virtual D.J screens, and of course, the people. It all gets a bit complicated, but things will become clearer as the report progresses.\r\n\r\nI took the shrooms at 9.30 p.m, leaving about a gram to half a gram, for later. 5 grams is a lot, and I trying to get them all down my gullet as quickly as possible was challenging, so I decided to savour them, to enjoy them more, eat them slowly, and swirl them round my mouth so that I could really taste them. I found this had a good effect later on, since the whole trip seemed a lot more relaxed, less strenuous or stressful (than my last one had been). I rolled up a joint with the pollen, partly to avoid nausea, which I occasionally get with shrooms, and partly too relax me, to prepare me for the ensuing trip. I find that if you go into a trip stressed or anxious, that is the way the trip is going to be. If you go into one relaxed and thoughtful, the trip becomes more enjoyable, and it is easier to take in the sights at a slow pace, ignoring some if you want. In this way, you can help stop everything becoming too much too quickly. \r\n\r\nThe pollen was really strong, but not sleep inducing. It made me much more alert, more sensitive to sights and sounds. A haze had appeared around me, and everyone was part of it, breathing it in and out. It was totally benevolent, and I embraced it, taking deep breaths and exhaling very slowly. I suppose it is a form of meditation, and once I had finished I was at peace - completely relaxed. The next joint took me up. It was as if it was working in harmony with the mushrooms, they had become one. I let the flow of energy rise up and envelope me. I did not want to speak, I wanted to look at everything, concentrate on each thing and see what it was, what it was doing. A friend asked me what was happening, impatiently waiting for his \'shrooms to work\', but I told him nicely to be quiet. At the beginning of a trip, it is helpful to be silent, and to try and get silence from others. Loud noises directed at you can divert your attention away, and put an annoying barrier between you and you visions, you new thoughts. For the twenty minutes, or however long you deem necessary, try to do this and I promise you it will help. It settles you in gently, allows you to prepare for more intense things to come. In a way, it is your introduction to the being you are going to spend the next 5 - 9 hours with. Be considerate, and observe, and everything will be all right. Once I felt focused enough I left my friends. I lit a cigarette, inhaled, and moved into the next stage. The walls that had once been grubby, uneven surfaces were now a mass of swirling, coiling, snake-like things, which formed beautiful patters. It was as if the bricks had come together to form an intense blue, very viscous liquid. I was afraid to touch it, so I just looked, and was happy just observing. For me, touching things can ruin my focus, but this is not always the case. I would like to be able to feel things, perhaps become one with them for a certain amount of time. I certainly have the ability to do this with other people; through touch you can bond with people in ways that are inexplicable, but beautiful. You can even get close to becoming one entity with them. I walked around for hours, staring, and then I noticed something I hadn\'t really payed much attention to before. I could talk to people with my mind, I didn\'t need to speak to them with my voice. Some people did not pay any attention to me, but with those that looked at me right in the eyes I could discuss things. It wasn\'t in English but we knew what each other meant. Sometimes what was thought had no form or idea, but we knew what was meant by it. You could tell wether or not you would like a person, whether or not they wanted to talk to you. I found myself looking for people to do this with, and once we had introduced ourselves, we resorted to ordinary speech. I would like to develop this further, and it is something I will really concentrate on over the next few weeks. It only really appears with hallucinogens, but it\'s great. For me, it\'s proof of psychic existence, and the power of the mind. It needs cultivating, but it could be used to great effect. It was my experiment throughout the trip, and I found that I could communicate in that way much more effectively with friends.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I noticed was the unity of the whole place, it was as if people\'s minds were forming a great mass above their heads, filling the whole place. It was a \'combined mind\', but like the real brain, it had many different parts. Each person was a separate part, but a section which work with others to produce the overall effect. This is the power of the place, and the reason why the whole experience is so different from anything else: your body is not important there, it\'s what you are thinking that\'s vital. The people who come in and don\'t let their minds and spirits go are the ones who don\'t enjoy it. If you don\'t let yourself become part of the experience you cannot enjoy what is happening. You have to let yourself go to understand what is going on. \r\n\r\nOn my travels through the \'caverns\' I found many people - some were happy to be in my vision, others were not. That is the way things go. You won\'t connect with everyone, and not everyone will like you, want to bond with you. The best thing to do is not to let it bother you, and in that way you can avoid being upset or freaked-out in many situations. I just ignored, or left those who gave me bad vibes, even when it was difficult not to ask myself why they didn\'t want to be with me. With so many people in one place, it is impossible to find harmony in everyone. This can be used in the world as a whole. Bond with people you feel you have a connection with, have something to say with, and ignore or tolerate people with whom you don\'t. It\'s working for me. I think that each person can learn so much from a trip, if you go into it the right way, and travel through it in the right frame of mind. I have found that you must not take shrooms, or acid, or any psychedelics to escape, but to learn, to discover to explore. Forget how fucked you are, forget the pains and strains of reality, and glide through whatever it is that happens to you. What I found helpful was that whenever I got too worked up, or freaked-out, a joint really calmed me down. Rolling up gives you a focus, and smoking the joint allows you to sink back into yourself, to relax and find what you lost again. I always found a quiet place with some friends, and sat down for a joint. I\'m sure many others do this, and would agree with me on this matter. \r\n\r\nAfter a few hours of taking in the sights, patterns, sounds, smells and people around me, I decided to find somewhere to lie down and explore my own mind. I had to close my eyes for this - when you close your eyes you are officially in your own mind, and what you see is only relevant to you. It is very hard to describe what I saw, but I will try and remember exactly what was there, in my head. An important theme was \'the tunnels\'. I was usually travelling forward, but often, I would be distracted by the colorful patterns warping and changing on the walls of the tunnels, and then I would start moving backwards, away from the light that I could see at the end of each one. It took and good deal of focus and determination, but I did get to the end, reached the light, and another vision was exposed to me. Sometimes they were horrible - screaming faces coming out of each other, eyes peering at me, then becoming figures dancing, which would expand out into walls made up of squares positioned in geometric patterns. After each set of visions, there was another tunnel and another struggle to reach the end. It slowly became easier, and eventually I was glided through, very fast, but enough to take in everything. Then everything came to an end, and I think I found my spirit. It was a head, very stiff, very upright, almost African looking. Sometimes it looked at me, other times it didn\'t, but it was there and it didn\'t change or shift like the others things I had seen had done. It was a statue, a goal I had reached. I opened my eyes, picked up my notebook, which already had stuff scrawled in it, and began to write again (this was REALLY HARD): here\'s a view things I wrote, there not very clear, but they might help you to understand how I felt during the trip:\r\n\r\nThe train, holding onto the rails like they are the only things that exist in this molten, swirling void. Where do I start? I can\'t even write can\'t, it\'s not here, I\'m here, are you in or out? Slipping, hold on to it and them - there/there. \'what are you, some sort of ventriloquist?\'\r\n\r\nI think the train and its rails represents the entity that I grabbed hold of and got through all the tunnels really quickly. The tunnels are perhaps the molten, swirling void (I saw them in that way). I seem to be writing about things from the real world not existing where I was; \'Can\'t\' is a good example. I just could not write it properly - it took numerous attempts to make it legible and to spell it correctly. I was there, but the words were not. I\'m not to sure about the rest. The last thing I wrote was a quote from the play; I\'m not quite sure what it means, but I\'m working on it. After that i started scrawling geometric patterns onto the page. They were quite impressive, considering I\'m awful at math. I could not stop, I kept swirling and spinning with the pen. There was a purpose, and after ten or so minutes it appeared: it was my guiding spirit. He appeared amongst the lines, and quickly I followed his outline and any others I could see before he disappeared. He is still there now, with some weird force, or what seems to me to be like life, spewing from his eyes and mouth. I\'d like to show you, but I don\'t have a scanner.\r\n\r\nIt was there that my visions ended, and I came out of the trip. I carried on smoking the pollen until there was nothing left. I was so happy, so fulfilled. I felt I really had learnt something that evening, or day, or night. The next time will be even better. (N.B. Any concept of time is what I perceived it to be after the event. During my trip, I had no idea of any time passing or going. It is unimportant, irrelevant to the journey. Ten minutes could have been an hour, half an hour, anything. They are only guesses.)"
2079,Primordial Fire,Nipo,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nTime: Around seven pm till 2 am on 20th of May 1995.\r\n\r\nOccasion: Smoking of several grams (4-6 g) of skunk-weed and ingestion of 8 large Psilocybe semilanceatas for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nSetting: This experience took place in my apartment in comfy bed while different very enjoyable ambient was beingplayed. A friend was present also enjoying little relaxatory doses of these substances.\r\n\r\nMind Set: I had not ingested any psychedelic substance since 4.11.95 (about 5 months pause). Have felt good for last weeks, and during previous week studied ethnobotany and anthropology quite intensively. During saturday first slept till 2 pm, and then went to a festival (alone though - was unable to reach any friends, which caused a very slight depression); \'Worlds Meet\' - all kinds of people there and lots of different musics/arts/thoughts etc. Nice atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAfter that went to Botanical Gardens of Helsinki University for a long stroll. Very nice, and I felt very peaceful and calm after leaving the gardens. Went home and a friend came at 6 when he said he\'d come. We started with a chat and a few small bonghits...\r\n\r\n\r\nThese skunk bonghits were always very subtle but powerful, I felt. One thinks one is very sober and normal, but when trying to do something or even thinking something complex reveals the true nature of things.. Fun, I\'ve always felt.\r\n\r\nWe smoked couple of small bongfuls of these (maybe 2 grams per head), and then decided to take a little time to listen to FSOL\'s ISDN and Isaku Sakaros Ohm.. Nice.. Both very nice for this ultralight-paragliding of the conciousness. Both are of very high fidelity with large hall and space-echoes even when sober, and my stereos are also very HiFi, so almost immediately I was swept along into the spaces and places in the music - every detail and overall perception of music was of very hig resolution. I was on the verge of literally tripping - nice visuals.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour we drank some mushroom tea. Taste was as icky as it had been 5+ months ago and before that, and all effects felt somehow very familiar. Though quite diluted, in spite of the very long pause. While stoned, the tenseness of the jaws was not felt coming on, and legs felt quite feeble already, so only coming on-effects were introduction of extra reverb into each sound, and very slow deepening of all thoughtpatterns... Visuals also came quite colorful, but the patterns I usually see on the retina (small dots, waves and squares of different color) were absent. Some Thursday Afternoon was being played, and we both decided that it w as bit too lame, as we both listen to it very much while reading and such.. So on came Terry Rileys Shri Camel.\r\n\r\nThis was probably about 45 minutes after ingestion. I felt very sober, could speak very clearly and still knew I was quite inebriated. My friend put on Flasher to about 15 Hz and white, and I decided to take a dive to the deep...\r\n\r\nTo some extent all this was spontaneous, and yet I did think every now and then parts of the hallucinations, for instance the tunnels... ... I thought, \'I\'ll go towards the light, white light,\' and these beginnings of caverns were forming in front of my eyes, of blue, and pink and orange color.. I searched for the white light, and found it.. I dove in and the caven changed into tunnel made of turquose rings of light, I sped through them, towards the white light, rings grew quickly paler and suddenly I felt very weird - awed sort of, bit scared if I should do this, or jus t open my eyes - I had lost the feel of my body and was completely away in the spiritworld.. I hesitated for a microsecond and then continued while thinking \'Don\'t think. Think nothing. Thinki pinki.\' [ =) ] - and suddenly was there -\r\n\r\nIn the _Primordial_Fire_, it burned me away, cleansed me of everything, parts of me beginning to melt and turn into dust blow away by the horrible force of this pure white light - I opened my eyes, as I felt a tingles in my body where the parts had begun melting - everything was back to quite normal. \'Oh, don\'t fight it,\' I thought, \'let go. Let go. LET GO,\' I said to myself, and closed eyes, stopped fighting it, the fire returning in the form of a volcano, volcano the size of the Himalayas, I was the volcano. I burned and oozed and was being purified - and this was not an unpleasant feeling, more like bittersweet, and I also felt very powerful... I was unable to completely let go, so this little doubt dwelt in the back of my mind, whether I should stop, for the intensity of everything was rapidly escalating. \r\n\r\nI the volcano turned from pale red to pure white, pressure building up along the temperature, and suddenly I let go. Just relaxed myself physically and mentally, and the volcano erupted into the skies, throught the skies to the space, towards all stars in the form of quark-sized million-kelvin particles. \r\n\r\nMy friend asked me whether I wanted to have a few hits off the bong.. I took some, and changed Riley to something else (can\'t remember). And then I lay down again, saying I\'ll take another dive. As I closed my eyes for a short time my thoughts and visions were very chaotic, but then I saw a woman. I don\'t know exactly what she looked like, and so on, but I stepped closer to her thinking I would began to have these visions of wild orgies I\'ve sometimes had - in the Psychedelic Experience it is mentioned as some bardo of some level.. But no.\r\n\r\nShe was Mother Earth. For a moment I was bewildered. Then I placed my hand on her vaginal lips, and first one, then two fingers slipped in.. Then my hand, and my arm.. And all the time I grew smaller, or she grew bigger, for I went inside her womb, which was a passageway.. I felt very warm.. very secure and she showed me things I had done wrong, things I should do... Very quickly after this the visions began to fade, totaling in about 3 hours.. My friend had taken a couple more shrms and he came out of it about half an hour later.. So we listened to weird and wonderful ambient-music and smoked and talked about what we had experienced... \r\n\r\nWhat was very weird is that we smoked at least 3 grams of nice weed during these hours between 11 pm and 2 am, and either didn\'t feel very stoned. Maybe the rest of the bag was not as good as the top, or then our tolerance (psychological) had increased after the voyage.\r\n\r\nSummary (sort of): Very nice experience of much greater strength than I had expected, even after 5 months pause. However I was quite in control, being able to return to normal levels of conciousness by opening my eyes. The effects of the setting, I feel, were very pro- nounced (primordial fire, purification, symbolic death and mother earth are all elements of shamanic traditions). I liked very much the softening effects of the marijuana on the phase where ef- fects are coming on. But had I ingested larger dose (eg. 40 mushrooms), the result wouldn\'t probably had been as nice. Even though the preparation period was very short (couple of hours in the Botanical Gardens) experience was quite divine. So I arrive to this conclusion: The Divinity or Quality is not connected to the Dosage. More is not necessarily Better."
89434,Body Diving,tigerfaerie,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, Damiana, DMT, Cocaine & Alcohol","\n<!-- I highly recommend MAOI damiana used with jungle spice, particularly if you are-->I was in the company of a lover who also enjoys the spice of life! We had consumed a bottle of wine and half a g of coke, before we went out to a friends club night, briefly, returning in just a few hours.\r\n\r\nWe got back and proceeded again with the booze, this time vodka, and finished off the last of the coke. My memory is a little hazy, I do believe we may have done a little speed too... But I cant remember if this was before the spice... I kind of hope it was secondary, as I\'ve heard its a bit dangerous to do speed/MDMA whilst taking DMT with an MAOI.\r\n\r\nAnyway, all buzzy and chatty I decided to brew a mild mushroom tea, about 60 or so liberty caps. We drink the tea, I have added damiana to the tea also. The experiment and use of MAOI\'s is becoming an interesting hobby of mine! And damiana is a favourite right now\x85\r\n\r\nWe have a new batch that arrived today and it appears to be my personal favourite, the jungle spice. We are just feeling the buzz of the mushrooms so we decide its a good time to do a pipe.\r\n\r\nMy co pilot fills up the pipe. It has to be said that all doses are sketchy, as it seems, in our experience, the body decides on how much it can smoke\x85 that said.. A week or so prior to this I did a huge pipe of 5-MEO and totally passed out\x85 so caution should still be exercised.\r\n\r\nThe radio is playing, by some miracle its david bowie, space oddity! I only manage two tokes the onset is very quick for me, I remember just before I closed my eyes the world around me began to pixellate into many fluid squares. As I leant back into a chair I saw with most brilliant clarity, a most amazing music video to space oddity! In the most brilliant colours, with the greatest sense of humour. There must have been some kind of transition of sorts, I have a strange suspicion that it was my co pilot launching himself into hyperspace.\r\n\r\nThen\x85 all of a sudden we are merged. Obviously there was no time for thinking in any of this all I remember was feeling a huge surge of energy and a sudden feeling a knowing of some kind, that my beautiful lover had somehow gotten right inside me in every imaginable way although we were at opposite sides of the room. It was incredibly intense! I could see him inside me, all over me, in every way, although this did not just feel like an erotic experience there was more so much more to all of this. There was no darkness at all. Throughout the whole trip there was a wonderful feeling of love. No uncertainty. I could see him, he had 1000s of heads colours of bright white and blue, incredible smiles, symbols, gestures, intense feelings of orgasm all over my body and also a wonderful amazing feeling of love and eternity, of a beautiful flow of never ending patterns and journeys.\r\n\r\nI could hear some kind of bellowing. I opened my eyes and sat up. My co pilot tends to keep his eyes open while on DMT (something I find very difficult) he also has the ability to move about, even after a pretty big hit, dance even.\r\n\r\nI saw before me a man groaning like some kind of trapped beast! Arms weighing him down and back stooped... In stupour in fact! I smiled toward him. It looked as though he was somehow dragging himself up out of something, and that this noise had come out in some kind of effort to free himself from something. We have a trust beyond most bonds so I accepted his actions without hesitation and closed my eyes again. As I closed my eyes, as I was watching him, I felt as though I could see what was happening. I saw immense red and green visions of him pulling out of my body! Like some kind of biomechanical something.\r\n\r\nI never thought this sensation was humanly possible, it was incredible, the most intense experience yet.\r\n\r\nA rough account of his experience: \r\nAfter I had taken my hit he took his, a big one too. We had both consumed equal amounts of consumables prior. He then sat down on a sheep skin rug. As the trip enveloped many many \'circular swastikas\' appeared\x85 they are often of blueish aura and look a bit celtic. The whole trip had a cartoony kind of nature to it. Then the rug that he was on turned into fire and he recalls his whole body started to catch light. This must have been the point when the noises began!\r\n\r\nThis trip was definitely extended by something, although we have not been able to accurately decipher if it was the damiana or the combination of damiana and mushrooms with spice. The mushrooms only seemed to last a max of two hours.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about DMT is I never know what to expect and thats why its a drug to really respect and to be even a little bit nervous of! The other thing I love is that it seems that once one set of the doors is open its impossible to go backwards, it just keeps growing into such an incredibly vast landscape.\r\n\r\nAlways with LOVE"
99058,Opti Makes Another Appearance,mysticbodhi,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI had read a few articles and experience reports in the past about Opti, people had reported seeing and communicating with the wise being that reportedly lived in the emptiness between all dimensions. Apparently he could communicate to individuals within any dimension given that they were in a particularly open altered state of consciousness. It was in 2007 that I first came upon of this creature and I began to find parallels between many personal stories of people communicating with a multi-eyed being from another dimension. A rather common hallucination, Opti is often not recognized for who he is, and is mistaken by many for a being from that individual\x92s spiritual tradition, a demon, an angel, or an alien being. Mostly appearing with many eyes and a body that does not hold its shape when looked at directly, it seems to be constantly shifting its parameters, like a vague blur.  Before my own experience I had chalked Opti up to the delusions of people who were desperate to find something paranormal or spiritual. It was not until several years later, after \x93jumping into the deep end\x94 of psychonautical experimentation and exploration that I would truly realize the value of what is experienced in such a state, and at the same time meet Opti. \r\n\t\r\nThe set was my apartment, on my couch, listening to some soft music and my mindset could not have been better. I been preparing for this physically and mentally for over a week and I had spent my morning doing some light yoga and qigong energy work. This story picks up around two hours into the experience, previous to that it had been a pleasant but not remarkable come up, and I provide no further time references for beyond the beginning because they are entirely lost to me, and I have no reference for when these events happened in relation to previous things.    \r\n\t\r\nIt was t+2:00 from ingestion and I was standing on the divide, behind me was everything that the many millions of manifestations of life on Earth had ever accomplished, before me was the endless void where consciousness ended and life had no place. I stood, wavering on the brink, unsure of what my next move was to be when something very distant appeared in the void, but moving rapidly towards me. When the being approached it was an apelike head, with eight eyes, the whole faced ringed in mangy brown hair. The teeth were like a humans as he smiled at me, yellow and stained, his body was simian but hard to pin down, constantly shifting. This was Opti. Thin lips peeled back over the yellow teeth in a wide smile as Opti greeted me. He told me one day I would learn the lessons of the void, and the truth of what lies beyond life, but that I was not ready. Opti was looking into my soul with all eight of his piercing black eyes, and deeming me worthy, but incomplete. Opti told me there were other plant teachers who had more things to show first, and that I would come back to him a much wiser individual. I asked Opti when that would be, and he told me \x93there is no such thing as a when"", but that time was a nexus of interconnected energy loops flowing between matter and giving us the illusion of moving forward in a coherent manner. \r\n\t\r\nThe void then faded, as well as the chaos behind me and all around was just the nexus of time, the constantly swirling and circling energy loops moving from object to object and ordering our perception of the physical world.  Opti was still there, moving in and out of the flows of time, each one filled with more colors than could ever be named or even imagined again. I felt so much awe and wonder at being shown such a phenomena, it was a very humbling experience. After a few moments I noticed the flows of time begin to fade, and I came to realize my physical body was below me, sitting where I had left it on the couch in my living room. I looked up to Opti, his black eyes shining approval on me. I had made a friend that day, one whom I would meet again, when I was more ready to receive the revelations about the nature of reality that he was to show me as he had shown many others before.\r\n\t\r\nMy second meeting with Opti would come a year and a half later, under similar circumstances, this time however I did not leave my body, but rather entered it, and conversed with my old friend while walking along the electronic highways within my own brain, Opti showed me the truth. That One is All and All is One, literally. All life, rocks, plants, people, animals, celestial bodies, and fungi are all egoistic manifestations of a single life force, tricking ourselves through sensory reliance and logical fallacies to believe we exist as individuals apart from the collective. The universe had now become my symbiont, as I understood the physical connections that take place between matter allowing energy to become and that life replenishing the energy that drives forward the fractal patterns of universal repetition which in its own way becomes a form of change."
94180,Trauma Victim Using Psilocybe,Donnatella,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI wanted to share a difficult Psilocybe experience with positive outcomes. I had been feeling suicidal three days before I ingested Psilocybe semilanceata. Using mushrooms while in such poor mental health has always been discouraged. I ignored this rule.\r\n\r\nI harvested the mushrooms myself, when I found them growing in my back yard early this autumn. Psilocybe semilanceata,  also known as \'Liberty Caps\', are common where I live. I dried them on a plate on top of my kitchen cupboard. \r\n\r\nI took 25 mushrooms, a low dose. I wasn\'t wanting to visit Mars, just explore my head. I had smoked a few joints before the trip and continued to smoke during. I smoke regularly and have a high tolerance to marijuana. It took about an hour for me to feel the trip begin.\r\n\r\nI was in my own home, and spent most of the trip looking into a large mirror. I noticed a lack of consistency in my self-image; sometimes I appeared as a child, sometimes as an adult. I had very little visual changes, other than that. In my mind I began watching various traumatic events, both from my childhood and from present. I cried, for the pain is so deep. This was difficult to experience, but I gained much from it. I could perceive patterns of behaviour and repeating attachment patterns that I was unaware of before. \r\n\r\nThe trip felt like psychotherapy. As a result of this trip, I was able to take feelings of rejection and resentment and reprocess them into acceptance and forgiveness. Although I would not recommend the suicidal Psilocybe semilanceata, I stand as proof it can be done with great benefit. I believe the key is a very low dose, and to make sure to be in a very safe place."
37576,Insanity and Panic,Ed Wood,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI had started my first year of college and did not know anyone very well. I had some acquaintances that I would smoke cigarettes with but we never really hung out more than that. One day they were talking about doing mushrooms and I had told them that I was interested in trying them, which I was for many years, and they told me I was in luck.  They had recently gotten ahold of some liberty caps and invited me to go along with them to trip in the woods. I tagged along with them deep into a forest that was miles from any form of civilization. On the way there we were pulled over by a cop because the car swerved and he thought we were drinking. We got away clean but this encounter made me extremely nervous.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at our destination and we all ate our mushrooms, followed by large amounts of orange juice. I had high levels of anxiety before they kicked in because I wasn\'t sure what the effects were going to feel like, however once I started feeling the effects coming on, I couldn\'t keep a smile off of my face. I giggled nonstop. We built a fire and watched the flames which looked gorgeous and graceful. I decided to gather some more wood, so I went on a little walk and watched the trees as they made wavy formations, and would expand as if breathing. In the crevaces of the bark, it seemed to emit a greenish-blue light. I came back and realized I brought no wood back with me. This made me laugh a great deal.\r\n\r\nWe continued small walks for about a half an hour longer which seemed like hours. This was when I noticed that one of the girls that was with us was crying and was extremely distraught. I asked her what was wrong and she said that the human body was gross and full of disease. I recoiled at this statement and felt uneasy. She told us that she was on her period and continued to say that the body was disgusting. I made a point to avoid her because I felt so uncomfortable, which caused my trip to turn to panic. I started walking away where I found one of the people I was with on his hands and knees.  He was violently vomiting. My panic went through the ceiling. I called out to the rest of our group saying that he was sick. All of them said that they couldn\'t handle watching someone puke while they were tripping and left me to deal with it. I knelt down by him and asked him whats wrong. He replied by saying he was going to die. Since I didn\'t know much about mushrooms at the time, I thought he really was going to die unless we did something. I went into the car that we managed to drive deep into the woods and found a water bottle for him. After a while he calmed down. By this time it was starting to get very cold (it was late fall) so we all got into the car and turned the heat on.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that I was responsible for everyone\'s comfort so I made sure I had water at hand in case anyone needed it. Soon enough all the water was gone, I exclaimed that my resources were diminished. Everyone got extremely thirsty. Everyone was shouting commands to turn the car on or off, change the heat levels, or turn the music on or off. I was overwhelmed with all of this going on so I climbed into the trunk of the car to be away from everyone else. They continued to argue with eachother nonstop. It was then I realized that the one that had puked was repeating the same phrase over and over again (\'Just get in the car, it\'ll be fine!\'). This went on for a half an hour which made me think I was going to go insane. Finally he stopped talking and moving. He was in a state of catatonic silence, and he was the only one who knew where we were. Panic climaxed at this point, everyone was convinced that this kid was about to die. We stepped out for a cigarette to calm down and assess the situation. I looked at the people I was with and saw that their faces were twisting and stretching. I asked myself why this was happening, then I remembered I had eaten some mushrooms. I started to calm down and realized that everyone was going to be fine and they just needed to ride out the trip. Two hours later our motionless friend started moving and eased his way back into reality. Soon enough he started talking saying that he thought he was dead and in hell. Once he came down to a comfortable level, he drove us out of there and we ventured home.\r\n\r\nI don\'t regret doing mushrooms that night. It taught me how to control myself and others if a trip gets overwhelming. It also taught me to be well prepared for a trip and to not just go into the woods unprepared.  Also, I found out to have a good understanding of what I am taking, had I known more about mushrooms, I would have known that we were not in any real danger. I also learned I should be with people I am  comfortable with, and that I know very well. I\'ve done mushrooms since then and they\'ve all been terrific experiences simply because I was more knowledgeable and comfortable with the setting."
103899,Feminine Serpent Spiral,sati,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI had taken psychedelics sporadically since my early twenties onwards. Then I reached a point where I did not value getting high any more. So apart from a little weed or a very occasional few beers I enjoyed being sober.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this experience I was at college studying art and through a series of synchronizations I began exploring shamanism. I listened to all the Terence Mckenna rap. Read M Eliade etc. Then decided I should experience the \'heroic dose\' thing. It was mushroom season so I began hunting. To begin with I gained small amounts..about a mouthful. These resulted in lovely closed eye visuals...conscious serpent down one half of my body and wood texture down the other...at the time I was carving a certain type of wood. These were nice experience but I wanted it to be stronger...I just could not find enough mushrooms. \r\n\r\nWell to cut a long story short I eventually found about 200 liberty caps. On the night of 23 Dec 2012 I ground them into a powder using a coffee grinder. This gave me 5 heaped teaspoons of mushroom powder. I put 4 teaspoons of this powder into a small cup of hot water and drank it up. I did not have the courage to take that fifth spoon.\r\n\r\nMINDSET \r\nNot great since the storm was so intense but I was determined to take the mushrooms...should maybe have done them the previous night when I was a bit happier and content. Not really sad either just a bit cold and uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nSETTING \r\nMy home..comfortable and quiet. Weather outside appalling storm. \r\n\r\nTHE TRIP \r\nI felt it coming on very quickly...about 10-20 mins. So I lay down on the sofa and turned out the lights...silent darkness...just like Mckenna suggested. As the feeling increases I see out of the darkness a spiral descend above me. It is composed of blocks of bright primary colours. These blocks morph into faces...female...serpent like...sexual and deadly. I have seen this image every time I took acid in the past...and always felt baffled as to what this was...I still don\'t know. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It was the first image I saw on my first psychedelic (acid) trip...it remains a mystery. \r\n\r\nAt first I watched this unfold with curiosity which soon turned to panic then fear as the spiral got closer. Also as the image became clearer and closer my identity and sense of self diminished. At the last minute I decided that I did not want to surrender all of me so I switched on the lights and hoped it would all be over. The experience just kept increasing in intensity however and I just held on for dear life it seemed. There was no separation between me and the weather...a storm of massive proportions was blowing through me. I could barely stand. My mind was full of faces of people I had seen recently...all disapproving and negative. I tried to warm up by sitting in front of a gas heater. \r\n\r\nAs I closed my eyes I had another vision. It was a factory setting...highly sci-fi/alien...made of brightly coloured perspex lit from the inside. I saw my body as a frame without visceral content. My right leg was composed of this coloured perspex material with a definite yellow colour. Then the vision was gone. I looked at the gas fire...it gave me some dearly needed comfort. Then I realized I was experiencing no separation between me and the flame. I realized I could easily embrace the fire and set myself alight...so I moved away...shame it was comforting after all. Back to the madness and the storm for who know how long. I found a drawing I had received praise for and set it beside me as a sort of talisman...this seemed to work to a degree...something to hold onto. I needed to pee...but god I could hardly stand. I crawled up stairs an sat on the loo...no way was I standing to pee in this state. I urinated with my head in my hands...eyes closed and had another vision. The most beautiful forest...coloured perspex again...and a waterfall. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the trip was just intense confusion and discomfort. Then it stopped in the space of a few minutes. I was all the way down. What relief!!! I went to bed so damn happy that I had survived. I went to bed so damn happy that I had survived. As I sat on my bed I experienced what it was to be this girl I knew. I did not have access to her mind or memories or anything like that...but her expressions and gestures and personality from the inside...it was just lovely and unique. \r\n\r\nA few months later while on holiday, at the airport she said something which ended with the phrase \'...the I could be you and you could be me.\' Interesting since I had mentioned none of this to her. The days after the trip were so peaceful and I was filled with love. This lasted till I went back to college and the usual day to day stuff reasserted itself. \r\n\r\nThese days I take mushrooms rarely and with such respect. The visions I turn into paintings. <!--  So there you go...hope that was a decent read-->"
110686,Doubt Breaks the Spell,KingKaleva,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nMy Friend and I were going to local national park in late autumn (in Finland) where we had tripped the year before, this time we chose to go there with bicycles so we would not have hike from there the 20+ km by foot. \r\n\r\nThe Trip Begins\r\n\r\nWe arrived to the national park and camped in a cottage which was free to use. It had wood stove and plenty of firewood, though we had to split the wood by ourselves from the logs. Left our backbags in  the cottage and hiked to near by hillcliff to smoke some herbs. Up in the hill the view opens large areas of swamp and forrest. The memories from the trip before came to my mind where we danced the hillside up and down in total darkness to drink more mushroom tea and back up to watch the stars. Also remembered our tactic to fight off the bears if we would ever meet one in the darkness, stick together, look big and have your knife ready....and other things that had happened.\r\n\r\nCame back to the cottage and smoked some more while preparing for the trip. My friend chopped some firewood and I scaled our doses, 3 grams handpicked psilocyben semilaenca + leftovers from the jar. Took them with classic style... grinded and swallowed with water.\r\n\r\nWe both had prepared for the trip by fasting so the mushrooms started to hit after 20mins. We were good friends and had tripped together multiple times so we knew how the beginning would go, both in our own \x93spaces\x94 and we would meet at the \x93otherside\x94.\r\n\r\nThe trip started for real after an hour or something when I sat up next to my friend and broke the silence with words... \x93doubt breaks the spell\x94 (in finnish = ep\xe4ilys rikkoo taijan). My friend turned to me, thinking what I have just said for a moment and replied \x93yy..yes!...YES!\x94 I don\'t remember what lead to those words but my friend totally got the idea...\r\n\r\nAfter this we felt something between us, like we were in bubbles that connected, and we knew it when we separated, like if you imagine two soap bubbles that connect as one and then separate them. We felt each other in our minds and to be sure this was not just something that we imagined we started to test this connection. \r\n\r\nWe both closed our eyes and turned around and started requesting \x93sound alerts\x94 from each other in our minds. Beep...Buub....Beep ...Buub back and forth, also switching that only one of us asked the sound alert and other said it out loud exactly when he got the \x93sign\x94 to check that this was really happening. \r\n\r\nAt first I started to doubt this and thought my friend was messing with me, but already when this thought came to my mind I knew that it wasn\'t so because I could feel the doubt physically and my friend felt it too...when the doubt tried between us... \r\n\r\nAfter this we dived in to it fully... no doubt that we just had connected ourselves telepathically and slowly when our bond and mental link grew stronger we slipped deeper in to the trance state and started  screaming and roaring...laughing from the bottom of our hearts that were now connected we just had connected ourselves telepathically and slowly when our bond and mental link grew stronger we slipped deeper in to the trance state and started  screaming and roaring...laughing from the bottom of our hearts that were now connected.. We felt each other in our minds and the feeling the other had, which superscharged our situation even more... I could ROOOOAAR it out loud when my friend supercharged it mentally and switch.  \r\n\r\nThe moment of madness was crowned by a situation when my friend went to take piss outside and I stayed inside the cottage, we still had the mental link and for my moment of \x93alone\x94 I started thinking something in silence (that I dont remember what it was) but for a weird way my friend recalled from my thought \x93something his father used to say...\x94 and I said it out loud... (dont remember what it was), it was multidimensional humor where I found it funny that to my mind there was no connection with my thoughts and what his father used to say and by the fact that I said it out loud what my friend though about my thoughts, in a situation where we had this conversation without any words but those few that I said out loud. (my friend could not see me but he could hear me) We started shouting, screaming and laughing again in a mad telepathic trance state.\r\n\r\nWhen my friend came back in we started to flow together in a river of feelings where we felt what the other felt, we shared our \x93universes\x94.. For a moment I stared the dark corner of the cottage and sad thoughts came to my mind and fear... The worst part in that situation was that when I went in the \x93dark part of myself\x94 I felt how it made my friend feel who was hugging me in total sadness and trying to get me out from there... that got me out and the \x93darkest hour\x94 was behind.  \r\n\r\nThe stove only had ember now and we tried to put more wood in to the pit, but this was a hard task when we were constantly interrupted by all the conversations we had in that telepathic link. \r\n\r\nHow we talked? \r\n\r\nWe had very long and complicated conversations and there were crossroads in those where we said  something out loud as a \x93agreement point\x94 or conclusions. \r\n\r\nWe got frustrated by the constant sidetracking and the stove still needed more wood..\r\n\r\nWe started shouting again...this time we shouted fire \x85 FIREEE NOW LETS MAKE THAT FIREEE!!! supercharging our roars mentally..... and magically.... the embers lit up... \r\n\r\nThis got us laughing hysterically and after that I added more wood with my shaking hands.....we were winners...\r\n\r\nSlowly the mental link started fading to the level of sound alerts until the ability for telepathy dissapeared entirely..but the bond we had was stronger than ever and it felt like we could never live without other ever again, that we were bros 4 life.\r\n\r\nIt was morning already and we backed our stuff and without any sleep we drove back to my friends place with our bicycles. \r\n\r\nSome after thoughts\r\n\r\nGetting so close to other person is a great thing but also sad because no other \x93friendship\x94 feels so deep anymore.....or maybe its just me..letting the doubt break the spell :D"
56331,Like an Inner Psychologist,Yoyoman,Amanitas - A. muscaria & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI\'m 23 years old. I\'ve tried amanitas 2 times. First time I ate about 2 amanitas and 50 psilocybe semilanceata. Coming down from that trip was very chaotic. Amanita is like an inner psychologist.\r\n\r\nI went to the woods alone today, to test amanita for the 2nd time. I was alone this time. Dark came quickly and couldnt even see stars because of the clouds. I had grinded the amanitas to small pieces because they taste so damn bad :P\r\n\r\nI ate them with water at 19.00, and some 15 psilocybe shrooms too. In 5 minutes I noticed my pupils had grown bigger. Then I got to my car and drove to a different spot and started walking. [Erowid Note: \nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href=""/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif"">Don\'t do it!]\r\n\r\nAt 20.00 it was pretty damn dark and lonely in the forest. There came a nice \'well being\' sensation, from the psilocybe shrooms mostly, even though there wasnt much of them.\r\n\r\nAmanitas taste like shit when eaten, but I get only a tiny nausea, and it comes after 2 hours of ingestion. Almost nothing :)\r\n\r\nTo the effect: \r\n\r\nIt may sound unbelievable, but eating amanita makes \'common sense\' much stronger. Thats the main effect. I dont usually get visuals from shrooms. I started to think about getting a GF and was thinking mostly about my family and their problems, and way of life.\r\n\r\nIt makes me understand that, we are like animals because we eat, shit and sleep. We have to go to sleep always at night. We take care of our children. We try to get a job that pays well, and money to satisfy our desires and support children. And we do stuff. It makes me understand why we do the things we do. I understand a lot what life is about ,) Life is simple. \r\n\r\nIf I have any psychological problems or something like that, it digs them to the open and offers a simple common sense solution to those things. About how can I be happy.... :D Its not a drug that makes me go run and yell and crawl and stuff, nothing like that. <!--I guess drugs dont do that usually, its the young people who use them that do the things they do.--> It clear my mind. But makes me feel a bit ill for a couple of hours. Like if I had smoked too much cigarettes... \r\n\r\nIts like a \'teacher plant\', what Castaneda talks about. But amanita is not for fun. It makes me realize and understand. And all that isnt fun at all. It makes you an adult human if you werent already ,)\r\n\r\nI\'m back home now. Time is 23.10. Its 4 hours since I ate them and now I feel a bit tired and stupid for needing to eat some damn shrooms.\r\n\r\n<!--Have fun while youre young and sleep well :D-->"
95754,Remissions From Cluster Headaches,Moosef,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nShrooms for Cluster Headaches\r\n\r\nAfter struggling with this horribly painful condition known as \'Cluster or Suicide\' headaches for about 3 years I decided to resort to a desperate act. I was going back to my youth on a shroom trip. Except this time with fewer than I had ever experienced before. Why? Shrooms help sufferers of cluster headaches and I was going to see if it was true.\r\n\r\nI had some old dried ones stashed away so on the onset of the \'beast\' one night I hauled them out and ate 3. <!--THREE??? I hear you ask. That won\x92t do a thing.--> Well precisely 7 minutes later it was gone. The sumatriptin injections or oxygen I inhale from a bottle takes at least 15 minutes. That\x92s a saving of 8 minutes of intense agony.\r\n\r\nBut that\x92s not all. It was 5 days before they struck again. 5 days of no pain for the first time in 3 years. It was the best wave I ever surfed and the best trip. \r\n\r\nI take them regularly now. They haven\x92t cured the condition but allow me much-needed remissions. There is however a downside, in that the body develops tolerances so I have to limit to only once a month (so I take a bigger dose and sometimes enough to have some fun, but it doesn\x92t work any better than just a tiny dose). The good thing is I can even take shrooms at work because the dosage is so small, there are no psychotropic effects."
96397,Reptilian Baby Jesus,lara,"Mushrooms - P. semilanceata, Nitrous Oxide, & Cannabis","\nI have experimented with magic mushrooms for years but this was my first experience with combining nitrous oxide with shrooms. I slowly ingested 2 large tablespoons of very strong mushroom honey sat around a fire with friends in my garden. An hour or so later I felt quite anxious and a little sick so I went to lay down on my bed. I soon felt better and returned to my friends who were high on MDMA, they decided to get the noz out and I was curious to know what it was like whilst tripping. \r\n\r\nNothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience... \r\n\r\nI took one deep breath of noz with my eyes closed and suddenly I was sucked into a worm hole of LSD like fractals. I took another breath thinking woah this is groovy, all of a sudden I clearly saw the face of a young child or baby boy made up of triangles... Not just any child, this child had razor sharp pointy teeth, elf-like wispy hair and reptilian-like eyes. I inhaled more and noticed there was a glowing golden motherly figure cradling the child from above. It was almost like being in the presence of a freaky lizard-like baby jesus and a ghostly mother mary. They both seemed to be trying to tell me something important but a second later they were both laughing at me hysterically. I have been a spiritual atheist all my life but after this experience I  have been compelled to research religion and ancient history. I am now on a path to rid myself of negativity and fear but it has not been easy and I still have a long way to go. \r\n\r\nThe weird thing is, my boyfriend\'s brother experienced almost exactly the same thing when we had 2-3 small bombs of MDMA, 20 liberty caps and nitrous oxide. He saw clear as day a child-like boy with wispy hair and nashy teeth, though when I inhaled my balloon I experienced something quite different... This time I saw myself made up of hundreds of tiny bright stars, that exploded... I then saw the same worm hole I was sucked into before but instead of the child, I saw what I can only describe as prehistoric earth evolving at such a high speed I couldn\'t grasp much of the information at all... All I can remember seeing was strange plants and lifeforms I have never seen before, herds of massive dinosaurs and then suddenly my mind was flooded with a very instinctive tribal emotion, I saw snippits of what appeared to be primitive humans. \r\n\r\nIt was all a little murky afterwards, next time I want to avoid smoking weed as I am sure it suppresses the memory of my visions. For weeks afterwards I felt like I was at one with the whole universe. \r\n\r\n<!--If anyone has experienced anything similar, please post it up on here because -->I feel like there is much more to this god-head child than one may assume... I believe that it is perhaps some sort of strange mental representation of our ego or some part of our past that as been imprinted into our DNA."
75277,Death is a Wimp,Infinite Love,"Huasca Combo (Syrian Rue, M. tenuiflora & Anadenanthera spp.) & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata","\nI decided to revisit the world of the other.\r\n\r\nMy journey began at 12pm Monday 24th of November 2008\r\n\r\nBefore my journey I ate only my normal veggie food. No yeast or aged cheese was consumed.\r\n\r\nI ingested 3g of Syrian Rue Powder in 6 veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 10 minutes. I then consumed 6.2g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powdered in veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 10 minutes. The first two of these I consumed with the last two Syrian Rue Capsules. I then consumed 8.0g of Mimosa Hostilis powdered bark in 20 veggie caps & 4.2g of Acacia Catechu bark powdered in to 7 veggie capsules.\r\n\r\nThe first two Mimosa Hostilis capsules were taken with the last two Psilocybe Semilanceata capsules. The rest were consumed 2 capsules every 10 minutes. Thus from midnight until 6am all capsules were consumed. A snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) & 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) 250mg was included in the mimosa hostilis as was an extra 2.0g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powder. All capsules were taken orally with a small amount of pure water and some organic clover honey.\r\n\r\nI consumed 3 organic unsalted Scottish Oatcakes. Washed down with half a pint of water. I also consumed 1 teaspoon of Organic Clover Honey approximately every hour from 2 am until 6am.\r\n\r\nThere was no Nausea. There was no Purging, no diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nI had to endure a very difficult task.This was very very difficult but the reward was a blessing of the most lovely kind.\r\n\r\nExperiences.\r\n\r\nI was transferred from my bedroom to literally another dimension. This dimension was death.\r\nI was dead. I was really truly dead. I was fully conscious not breathing. no one was there. My hell was my room and my house which I was never to leave. There were no people no ghosts, no spirits, no animals, no aliens nothing but me. I could shout and scream or talk calmly. But no one was there there was no answer. No friends no loved ones, no one at all except me & Death. This vile slime, this vile filth, this vile crud was all & everything that has ever been wrong. It was cruel, absurd, insane, demonic, twisted, noisy, dirty, messy, unloved, rattling, banging, screeching, shuddering, despicable, demented, unknown, fictitious, controlling, tyrannical, bullying, violent, murderous, trapped, torturous & unspeakably wrong. I had to do battle with this moronic unfeeling nightmare of death, perversion, ignorance, selfishness encased in wilful depravity. I fought all night until I collapsed naked on my sofa down stairs. This was not in my head. I found my house stained with slime and dust & cruddy specks of filth. There were drinks up the walls on the floors stained. But these stains were covered in cobwebs and the accumulation of toxic dusts, molds & mucous. There were bits of paper fluff receipts junk old faded plastic bags bottles caps and other buried junk from  the earth.This was not my home or my house or my street or my dimension. I walked like and old man shuffling side to side not forward or backwards.This hellish dimension of death was utterly cold. Inane, vacuous, vacant laughter came from the walls the bed the house the doors banging crashing scratching at my soul. I was in a battle for my soul, sanity and mind.\r\n\r\nOne on One with death.\r\n\r\nI could hear the clock ticking ticking ticking so loud. Yet I have no clock in my room.My watch had stopped at about 4am The hands of the watch moved backwards and forwards and sometimes it did not move. This was for many many many hours. I began to panic I suddenly realised I was indeed dead. Totally dead. There was no escape. I was destined to go up & down the stairs looking for any one or any thing that could help me hundreds of times.I was lost and resigned to this prison. I thought to my self this is it I have really done this time I have o.d.\'d.I could not leave my house. Things did not work as they should sounds were slowed and very fast and grimacing gurning hideous facial expressions were occurring every moment on my face. Strange noises and demented childish noises of toilet functions, burps, farts, gutters,ringing,clanging, sewage flushes, retches and noises of the most indescribable patheticness....these obtrusive desperate attacks on me worked. I was thrashing around at the speed of light so fast like a strobe I rolled & twitched entangled in bedding and clothing. Caught up in a mangle of tangle.I was gone dead suffocated strangled by invisible hands as my mind was ripped from my corpse and taken in the the depths of insanity.The room was chaos. Books would turn over automatically. The watch was frozen at 5am. I was in Hell my own hell my lonely worthless pathetic gruesome Hell.Ten billion words a second flashing through my head every voice of every evil wretch & every damned barbaric demon.They laughed and assaulted me in every way ripping me apart and reconstituting me again only to be ripped apart again and again.\r\n\r\nVictory.\r\n\r\nSo how you may ask am I able to wright this account. How did I recover & revive myself from absolute death ?\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple I owe my life to one man. David Icke.\r\n\r\nYes David Icke.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of my eye whilst thrashing in my wrestle with death I saw David Ickes book.\r\n\r\nTales from the time loop.\r\n\r\nTales from the time loop.....instantly I saw a way out of this. Death ? There is no Death.\r\nInfinite love is the only reality everything else is illusion. I fought my mind back from the abyss by repeating & repeating this mantra over & over....again...and again....thank you David Icke. I laughed for joy as I realised that I was stuck in this tale from the time loop.\r\n\r\nI love my family I said I love my family I love David Icke I love goodness love peace & wisdom. I love God.I repeated this many many times.....\r\n\r\nGradually the twitching subsided the voices became more and more infantile pathetic broken into whispers.\r\n\r\nI worked it all out in an epiphany of pure joy & bliss.\r\n\r\nI was dead in the Matrix. Yet I knew now it was a Time loop. The watch was still stuck at 5am & I was stuck in a loop... Death...Meets...Time....D.M.T.....loop.\r\n\r\nI was overcome at the Genius of Infinite Oneness Infinite possibility. David Icke...David Icke.\r\n\r\nDa Vid I c \'k...e.....Tales from the Time Loop.\r\n\r\nI knew then that this name was my ticket out of death.\r\n\r\nDa  = The\r\nVid = Video\r\nI   = I\r\nc   = See \r\nk   = OK\r\ne   = E..EEE... E.. is for Ecstasy Loved up... Love... Love...Love\r\n\r\nInfinite Love is the only REALITY...Everything else is ILLUSION... I can not Die I am not Dead. Death is Illusion. I was in a loop !!!\r\n\r\nA Loop... and a Tale is a story, a fabrication, a fiction....an Illusion.\r\n\r\nI had seen a video of David Icke at Brixton Academy. Where he explained the whole illusion Game plan.\r\n\r\nThat was it I immediately noticed a massive subsidence from the Death Beast. Whimpering and scurrying away like slime down a mouldy wall. The twitching lessened over the next hours or so ass the watch hands started moving again slowly at first but gaining pace until normality arrived and I exhausted collapsed in total comfort and without moving I slept deeply and awakened at 8am totally refreshed totally awake. Not tired in any way. I saw Blue sky and heard the birds & the people getting off to work.This dimension is not the same as my last  dimension. I am the Time Traveller. The Soul Traveller. I am alive in body and in soul.I am inter dimensional infinite love I am not the illusion I have beaten the illusion. I am free. I have liberated my family. I sacrificed my life to beat Death....and I did beat death. Now I know we are safe. I am not afraid of death. Death is a wimp.\r\n\r\nMy family arrived and they were a bit flustered and dusty and the house looked like it had been frozen in time dust and clutter was everywhere. Not at all the same house I came from.I travelled through space time. This was my destination my HEAVEN. My lovely family my lovely friends my new Brother David Icke. There was a new feeling to this place everyone was smiling and happy. The birds were happy.I was happy ecstatic. I hugged my mum & Dad and brother.Something I have rarely if ever done before. I immediately & without question decided to fix everything that was wrong in my life. I scrubbed the House polished the house and spent all day removing stains and doing favours for friends and family which again is something I am not often asked to do. And in truth I have rarely offered to do. Now all I can think of is helping everyone. Talking to everyone and making a plan to shake Mr. Ickes Hand.\r\n\r\nHe has told the truth and Infinite possibility a.k.a. God has shown me this.\r\n\r\nThis is why David Icke is my hero and I want him to know that he will be cured & is now being cured of his Arthritic condition. This is a gift from me to him. And when I shake his hand his pain will disappear.\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\nDeath is not linear. We do not age in linear fashion.\r\nDeath is not in front of us. Nor is it behind us. It is not above us neither is it below us. When you move forward you end up back at the beginning. Life is a loop a Moebius.\r\n\r\nSo where is death ?\r\nIt is one step away to the left. The dimension of the left is Death. The Dimension of the right is life."
7449,"12 Miles Later, 350 Caps In Hand",Dinge,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nAfter spending a day walking around on Dartmoor for a calculated 12 miles we ended up with a bag of liberty caps and a large carrier bag of fly agaric (about a kilo). The walk was most terrible but advised if you enjoy what I have to say.\r\n\r\nLater on that day (at my house) the mushrooms were counted out and the fly agaric shared between us. we had 350 liberty caps in total and a fair few large fly agaric caps each. The Liberty caps were all brewed up, and my fly agaric cut up and drying on a few plates. \r\n\r\nWe shared most of the brew out between the three of us (worked out to be 80 caps each) and drank, which tasted fine with a couple of tea bags and a lot of sugar. We didn\'t no how long it would take to start having effect but we started to feel quite different about ten minutes after we had drunk the brew, nothing intense at all but just a slight strangeness. My father then gave us a lift over to Ollie\'s house where we would spend our unconscious state.\r\n\r\nThe next set of events I am telling you to the best of my ability, I cannot remember what happened exactly but I will try my best to describe the nights proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe were all getting quite silly in the car, laughing a little but all trying to let the mushrooms take control of us and not just trying to play up on the fact that we were poisoned, all slightly worrying if we had taken enough and if we were going to be that out of it. Our paranoia soon came to end as soon as a foot was stepped out of the car. A slight breeze against our intoxicated cheeks, floating towards his front door as if we had just been dropped off on some weightless paradise. Colours so intense, even though it had been dark outside for a few hours. Walls of nearby houses were morphing between different shades of pink and purple, all of us in complete and utter harmony with each other and our surroundings. \r\n\r\nWe knocked on his door but no one was in, so proceeded around the side to his back garden, as if we had just found the portal to the secret garden. The grass looking so plush and fantastic, changing from green to purple, the three of us talking to each other in amazement of what we were witnessing in front of us, totally loving the surroundings, all with a smile reaching from one ear to the other planted on our faces. Ollie came up through the back gate with a few more friends just coming back from scoring some ganja. We proceeded into his house and up to his room where the bongs started getting passed around.\r\n\r\nEveryone else there had dropped pills, which did put the three of us on a strange level with them, but we put up with it anyway it was not too bad but if you are going to do mushrooms it is advised to be in a place where you are just with people that are intoxicated on the same mushrooms as well.\r\n\r\nThe real hallucinating started in his room after sitting in three rounds of large bongs. Just as weed enhances the hallucinations if you are on ecstacy, the same and even worse I think happens with mushrooms. Also I clearly remember Tim rolling bloody nice joint and wondering how the hell he could do that in his state. I was seeing geometrical patterns of different colours. The strange thing though was that these patterns were morphing from one thing into another depending on what environment I was in. The shapes would change size and position and colour. If I went outside the setting that before was euphoric now seemed dark and depressing, the shapes would morph into something that represented evil, due to the dark setting. A sort of Picasso cubist style, horned beast was in front of me, laughing the most terrible laugh ever, then that would change into lots of smaller ones in a lattice formation within my imagination, still constantly laughing. This shit was freaking me out and I was getting scared, I definitely had to get back inside.\r\n\r\nTime seemed very distorted and what was 3 or so hours seemed to take a whole day to pass by. I had heard about people tripping on fly agaric for days, and still not coming out of it totally for years. I didn\'t know if this was true when I heard it but when I was on liberty caps, I honestly didn\'t think that after hallucinating so much I would ever come out of my state. This made me extremely petrified and I actually remember quoting to Tim and Pete \'I don\'t think I am ever gonna stop tripping\' This was near the end of the night when things started to get dodgy and at one point found myself being sick down the toilet thinking I was going to die.\r\n\r\nWe decided to walk home after that I think due to the people around us and the ganja that we were smoking we all started to sketch out a little, and sure enough all of a sudden I was nearly completely back to normal having to suffer the hour long walk home, but knowing that the mushrooms I had taken and stimulated parts of my brain that I had never used before, a totally mind expanding experience. I cannot wait to feel the same again, this time knowing that it will come to an end, and probably a little less ganja for me I think. It\'s a long way to mushy season but I cannot wait.\r\n\r\nA quick word about the fly agaric. When they were dry I ate them with another mate; Ben. We had about 10g between us and didn\'t feel a thing, still I\'m very weary of there powers, and I don\x92t think I\'ll take them again, just in case."
8951,Attempt to Smoke Shrooms,Kingerik,Cannabis & Mushrooms - P. semilanceata & P. cyanescens (smoked),"\nMe and a friend of mine had a grip of libertys and wavys and decided to try and smoke a little with some pot. we took a dried gram of each and crushed it into a powder and started to load a \'pinch\' on top of each bowl until it was gone, which took longer than we expected. the experience was very dreamy with sounds being highly pronounced along with flashes of strange geometric patterns with my eyes closed, but nothing intense.my friend said he felt just stoned (this could be because he weighs 45 more pounds than me).  it lasted 2 hours or so. i think it would be more intense if done while already tripping."
99360,Well That Was a Bit Different,wireless,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI am a well versed tripper but last season me and my un-named friend kinda pushed it a bit. I have years of experience using cannabis, LSD, ecstasy, salvia divonorum, bufotenene and liberty caps.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you liberty caps or as we call them magi\'s are the best. In the past I have taken them with groups of friends meaning the amount used was relatively low aprox 100 each. This last season only my self and my un-name friend wanted a trip. We went picking, fortunately we live in the South Wales valleys and it was a very wet summer in 2012 so picking was good. We managed to pick about 12 ounces of fresh magi\'s in about 2 hours. Now normally in the past that would have been enough for several brews but under instruction of my un-named friend we brewed the whole lot in one go. I stuffed them in the end of a pair of tights tied it off and was left with a sausage of magical delights about a foot long and wider than a can of coke. We brewed this in a saucepan, squashing out every last drop. Once finished we where left with a concentrated black slime which filled about 3 half pint glasses. We downed our first glass each. Within about 20 minutes I could feel the tingle of the frenzy creeping from my toes and fingers to my core. At this point we split the last glass and then it kicked in proper. \r\n\r\nThe visuals where the most amazing thing and they were better when I closed my eyes, imaging the best CGI media player style music art times infinity. The chosen sound track was Tool 10,000 days (for the pill heads of the 90\x92s it was happy hard core for us its Tool). Never have I ever felt so closed to god it was the most spiritual experience I have had. Also the physical rushes as the music penetrated my soul were better than any ecstasy high I have been on. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this level of high unless the conditions for it are perfect, I have a very good control of self under extreme dosage through years of experience and I am in a good emotional place so no head fucking myself. Also the room needed to be dark with minimal stimuli due to the extreme perception shift. The most intense part of the high lasted about 3 hours where we were completely immobilised and incapable of social interaction. After we had come down a bit we could again talk and giggle and leave the room. \r\n\r\nI love the experience so much we did it again a couple time in the season. But I have just one question, \r\n\r\nIs it normal to take this much?"
102997,Plants Telling Me to Leave,Zebmos,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nShroom Tea\r\n \r\nI drunk the chilled shroom tea. It didn\'t taste that bad but drinking it was hard on an empty stomach. I drunk about 2/3rds of a bottle.\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms hit me very quickly and in an instant I went from very loud and talkative to a status state of wide mouth and eyes. I stumbled around a bit and I didn\'t feel the urge to go inside at all. I in fact felt very creative and wanted to stay outside. I started doing a sort of tribal troll dance, grunting primitively and stomping my feet going round in a circle. It became really rhythmic and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nWe went back down and my friend Alexander started grumbling about not feeling anything at all while I was, thinking I was peaking when I was in fact nowhere near the full intensity of the trip. There was a bottle on the grass, and I felt determined to pick it up with my shadow. I spent a while trying to do this as sometimes I thought I saw my shadows fingers curl round the bottle.\r\n\r\nThe Idea of being In general ambience, being In a foreign place and one or two supposed places of \'haven\', a beacon or milestone with significant spiritual experience but a generally hostility to it, all these \'havens\' are is peoples front porch lights. I remember noticing this tear In the sky (the moon) and thinking we are all trapped In this box and I could get out if only I could open up this tear and climb through. Because the moon was so white I thought If I got through I would be In a world of Infinite light.  The only problem was I couldn\'t open the tear any more. Many times through out the trip I could see myself in a box, hardly containing my body when I was in fact in open air and the world felt like a canvas, painted on that I could simply tear through.\r\n\r\nThe only real things I was aware of were this bright tear and the light of a cottage say 100 meters away. Somehow I linked that if I could get to the cottage it would in some way help me open this tear, something about a hose to clear away the clouds I cant remember. \r\n\r\nCrossing from where we were to the cottage seemed to take an eternity, it felt like crossing a desert, travelling through this void of darkness took a lot of mental effort. When I reached the cottage house with its light still on, I very carefully got to the front porch and for just a few seconds this place seemed perfect. This light in darkness had led me to a comfortable door mat and there were plants on the doorstep. For a few seconds I spoke to them and they seemed fine, but eventually they started telling me to go away. They spoke in a child\'s voice and there was no real tone. There was something quite frightening about these plants telling me to leave but eventually I left the front porch alone and wandered off again into the night.\r\n\r\nLooking back on it I now realise I was trying to re-create something on that porch space; hanging on to a distant memory of happiness and content. All though I am not sure what the memory was, by leaving the porch which was hard, I let go of it and kept a good head space instead of just sitting there, desperately grasping on to a lost memory.\r\n\r\nThere was another house say 300m away, I felt like I was on some sort of quest and that this was simply the right place to go. There is not a single house there though. There is a house and say 3 or 4 barns that look like houses (modern roof etc.) and this place just seemed so... Perfect. There was a buzzing of an electrical light which I eventually perceived as a bar full of people,  I knew I couldn\'t speak to them (part of me knew I\'d get in trouble for opening peoples doors In the middle of the night) but there existence gave me comfort. I then saw a plant by the road that seemed different from the others, it seemed to glow a naturally innocent blue and it seemed very attractive. I bent down to look at it and started feeling one of the leaves. It was wet and felt great. I then realised I could in fact speak to the plant. I went through the entire fall in love and break up with a plant In about 5 seconds I then realised I could in fact speak to the plant. I went through the entire fall in love and break up with a plant In about 5 seconds, during which I felt some very intense emotions. Immediately after that I headed back to the cross roads to find my friend. I cannot remember much but I believe he was pretty normal at this point. Said he was definitely feeling something. If I stared at a tree  it would turn blocky and low quality like. There was a single tree I could communicate but not the others. The ditch by the road seemed like a endless black hole. The plants in it seemed to be floating on nothing and looked somewhat sinister.\r\n\r\nAt this point my feeling of isolation and being on a different planet got uncomfortably large. Looking back at the cottage light it seemed horribly alien. One of the most fascinating parts of the entire experience was when I then looked at Inverness in the background, maybe 20 miles away, seeing this huge expanse of street lights and remembering that is symbolised so many people. Literally (for the  first time in my life) something took my breath away, I spent a short amount of time simply gasping for air as I looked at the city from afar.\r\n\r\nI remember hiding behind a bin when I saw a shadow with a gun pointing out of a window behind the curtain then felt quite scared, telling Alexander to get down before he gets shot. As he approached me he morphed into a large fat man that reminded me of a police man so I ran away, then shortly returned. By this time he seemed very quiet and didn\'t respond to my actions as much. If was seeing very obvious portals and warping of the world by this time. \r\n\r\nAt this point the mushrooms started to have a significantly larger effect. If I looked directly down at the road, I could see elevator type structures flying into the sky. They were covered in bright red and yellow lights. There was a large expanse of these elevators, all of which started below the ground. We went to sit on the road leading to a single farm, on a very steep slope and laid there for a while, at this point I peaked. In no specific order, time started to move extremely slowly, as in a second felt like five. I remarked this to  Alexander who did not respond. If I looked at my iPod and put it close up to my face I felt like I could almost jump into the light. The stone background looked like a designer flat and very comfortable. At this point the universe seemed to explode. Flashing lights would zoom past and glow, tunnels of light would lead up to the sky. It was very enjoyable as somewhere I knew none of this was real. \r\n\r\nI remember then looking back to the trees and seeing faces appear in the leaves that whispered inaudibly. When I looked at the grass, a lot of it would disappear and the remaining blades would increase in size, glow a brilliant blue and rotate into teeth like shape, making hissing noises while doing so. At this point (forgetting my friend) I decided to head back to his house. By the time I had got there I was starting to come down and it was not pleasant at all. It took a lot of mental and physical effort to climb back through his window but I did it making a relatively small amount of noise and without hurting myself. Climbing into his room was bliss. The instant musky heat was a huge difference to outside and it felt fantastic. I then suddenly remembered my friend and went back outside to go find him. At this point I was still getting some very obvious visuals, ie. plants sprouting from pitch black instead of soil and random mushroom like objects appearing where ever I stepped in the dozens but I could operate and see fine at this point. After searching quite a bit I decided to go back in as I needed rest. I then spent about 2 hours just sitting in bed simply laying there, not in any from of physical pain, but thinking was hard. At this point I decided I needed to go and find him. \r\n\r\nLuckily he was just standing outside his garden by the gate, and had probably been there for a large amount of time. He was very unresponsive and all he could do was say \x93huh?\x94 every 10 seconds, irrelevant to if I had actually said anything or not. I eventually got him inside without attracting attention and sat him down in his bed. He spent the next 2 hours simply crying, but after that he was fine.\r\n\r\n[Reported dose: ""80 caps"", unclear if this was for the whole bottle, or the portion of the bottle that was consumed]"
11135,A New Mind,FUN GUY,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nI started out by planning out my day. Just like most journeys to the unknown. I strongly felt the urge to ingest the mushrooms around 3 o\'clock, so I could witness the fall of the sun around six. About an hour before the trip I decided to take an hour long weed nap, I didn\'t want to have a weed high during my trip. I like just feeling the all out effects of the mushroom. I didn\'t want to have a weed high during my trip. I like just feeling the all out effects of the mushroom.\r\n\r\nI awoke from my nap, and had an incredible urge to ingest the mushrooms, I took out the 1/4 and started to pray with the mushrooms, this gave me the strength to not question the power of the mushroom. I slowly ate the fungus and swallowed it down with some apple juice, for the vitamin c and to help the bitter taste of the stems, the caps had no bitter taste at all. I didn\'t want to wait for the onset so I put my body under my blanket and listened to some music. \r\n\r\nAs my body started to tingle and my ego started to fade I saw my vision start to blur and I started to hear a loud buzz or hum. I slowly took the blanket off my head and saw fantastic colors all around the room. As the shrooms intensified I found myself slowly falling off the bed, once on the floor my ego was dead. I was stuck looking at some sort of force. Way too difficult to see and and too intence to find out what is was. I belive it was my spirit of some sort. My mind started to boggle at this time, I had really bad retrospectives on my personality.\r\nI found out later in the trip I was just starting to live. \r\n\r\n\'Have I been dead all these years, just now alive for the first time\' I thought. As the trip started to fade I realized I needed to just be myself, educate my mind to the fullest I thought, get involved in the world. \r\n\r\nIn this trip I found out its a terrible thing to make the body control the mind, let the mind flow and just take me wherever I go, people like a person that have a beautiful mind. This was far the best trip I have had."

4938,The Fun and the Not So Fun of Mushrooms,Mopopo,Mushrooms - P. semilanceata,"\nUp to the day I ingested the mushrooms, I never did any drugs other than, or course, the happy green plant.  I got together with 3 friends 1 of who has done mushrooms b4.  We went and purchased a half ounce and split it into an eighth each.  We all went over to one of the friends house to watch a movie.  At about 11:00pm we sat in his room and all of us ate our share with some ripple chips.  They didn\'t really taste all that bad compared to what I\'ve heard.\r\n\r\nSo, we gobbled them down, smoked a bowl and sat down to watch the movie.  I was pretty excited becuase all I\'ve done is weed now this is something \'new\'.  While I was wathcing the movie, I was really watching out for the first sings or trippin.  About half way through the movie, It felt like warmth and tingling starting from my toes up my legs.  I asked my experienced friend if this is what happens and he said basicly yeah.  So I just sat there watching the movie, very, very, very, (it seemed) gradualy I was becoming a little more confused, I kept on asking \'how long have we been wathcing this movie for?\'  It seemed to draaaag on.\r\n\r\nI started to get almost a butterfly type feeling in my stomache, It was a mixed feeling of nervousness and excitment.  About an hour and a half into the movie I started to trip.  I remember staring at my hand for what seemed like so long, it looked like my hand was a clif and the couch was water.  It was really wierd.  I went and sat by the fire place and tripped harshly.  I thought I was wathcing a puppet show, it was only burning logs, but to me a puppet show.  Things were starting to get really wierd and my perspective was changing.\r\n\r\nI went to my friend and said, \'Wow, I\'m pretty fucked.\'  He said, \'Oh no man, This is nothing, you\'re not even peaking yet.\'  I was thinking, how much more could this get?  The next thing I remember was the movie finished and we were all standing up looking around.  Everything to my was tinted in rows of different colors.  I kept on saying, \'This was an awsome idea guys.\'  Over and over again.  While 2 of my friends were sitting by the fireplace, me and the remaining friend wanted to go outside, we called them and they followed.\r\n\r\nEverything was sooo strange.  Lights were very bright and wonderful.  My friend showed me a necklace made of colored beads, when he shook it around it seemed to beautiful.  Thats when I noticed I was seeing tracers.  They were blurry colors that followed the movement of my hands when I waved them.  We walked down to this gravel pit where no one goes.  It was about 2:00am now.  I was peaking.  We sat in a tight circle on the gravel and smoked a bowl and we were all SOOO full of ideas and theories and philosiphies.  We all connected and agreed on soo many things.  Why doesn\'t everyone just stop fighting, we nedd peace.  I remember thinking to myslef, wow, this is like another dimension, when people do mushrooms they enter this world with me.  \r\n\r\nWell, After we sat there for about an hour, we started to get really cold.  My friends all stood up and were spinning around looking up at the stars.  I stayed sitting down.  This is where the bad part comes in.  I started to feel sharp pains in my stomache.  I was thinking, \'oh no I\'m overdosing.\'   I started to get really sick and worried.\r\n\r\nMy arms were going numb and I was feeling REALLY bad.  I just laid down on the cold ground and wathced my friends have fun.  It sucked!!  One friend came up to me and I said, just leave me hear for a while.  Thank god, he talked me into standing up and walking.  It made me feel a lot better.  I almost ralphed.  from this I learned try to ignore gut rot when it happens.  I really felt like I was gonna die.  I walked back and insisted to sleep at that moment at my friends.  I was starting to go down.  It was about 4:30am.  I was soooo tired.  That seemed to have more energy and went driving to the store.  \r\n\r\nI learned from this trip that mushrooms are a wonderful thing.  You just have to be prepared and be with someone who has done them and can talk you out of a bad trip.  Mushrooms REALLY open up your mind and is a great.  I think it is REALLY worth trying becuase It is an unexplainable experience."
