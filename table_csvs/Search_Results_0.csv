42367,"Revelations, Cosmic Unity, Entity Contact...",Peter Pumpkin,"Mushrooms - P. mexicana, Alcohol & Cannabis","\nPast drug history:\r\n\r\nPsychedelics: I have taken mushrooms about a dozen times. I have also taken LSD 5 or 6 times, and LSA (morning glory seeds) 7 or 8 times. I have taken 2ci once. I have taken Ketamine hundreds of times and am very experienced with it. \r\n\r\nEmpathogens/Stimulants: I have taken \x91ecstasy\x92 in one form or another( MDMA, MDA, MDE etc) probably in excess of 300 times. I have taken more Amphetamines than I care to remember. I have taken cocaine only a hand full of times.\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\nI also drink alcohol frequently.        \r\n\r\nIntroduction/set/setting:\r\nSo, it was a Friday night (nearly a week ago now). I had been drinking quite a lot from the early afternoon, enjoying the last of my time off work. In the evening I went to the pub to meet a few friends. By about 8.30pm , however, I decided to go home because I just didn\x92t seem to be in the mood. I arrive home at about 9.00pm, and I am sort of half-drunk, and find myself becoming a little bit bored.\r\n\r\nAt first I consider just getting an early night, but I then start considering munching some of my mushrooms (I bought a kilo off an online vendor from Amsterdam about a week before).  At first I don\x92t think it\x92s a very good idea since I\x92ve been drinking a fair bit, so I try my best to \x91detox\x92 for the next couple of hours and then make a decision. I guzzle down loads of water, and make myself about 4 cups of tea. I go on the net for a while on MSN and talk to some mates. \r\n\r\nEventually I decide I feel well enough to trip. I\x92m thinking about how long it\x92s been since I last tripped alone, and how badly I missed it! I\x92m off to Asia for 6 months of travelling in a few months, but I don\x92t really have a solid idea of what I want to do after that. So a decent introspective mushroom trip seemed like a very viable solution to this! I\x92ve always enjoyed using psychedelics to generate new ideas and find out what I really want out of life. This is why I\x92m such a big fan of them. The potential for self-growth is staggering. \r\n\r\nSo, I start preparing a little bit mentally. I whack on some chilled out ambient music, and some Buddhist meditation music whilst I start eyeballing a dose which I think comes to about 5 grams of Mexican Cubensis (I\x91m getting quite good at eyeballing, which is lucky, because I don\x91t have any scales at the moment!). Now, 5 grams is a very high dose for me, in fact it\x92s the highest I\x92ve ever taken, the second highest amount being roughly 40 grams fresh, with my usual dose (for a solid \x91common\x92 to \x91strong trip\x91) being around 25-30 grams. However, I\x92d tripped twice before that week already, so I figured that I\x92d probably have a slight tolerance. So, after eyeballing a dose, I go downstairs to make myself a tea (the only way to take shrooms in my opinion!). However, I discover I\x92ve run out of ground ginger (which I believe is an essential part of the formula), so I do some rummaging and find a ginger and lemon grass cordial drink. Not ideal by any means, but it would have to do. I put a tiny bit of the thick liquid into a mug, add hot water and add the shrooms. I also add a couple of spoonfuls of sugar. \r\n\r\nI return to my room with a bottle of mineral water and some Rennies (ant-acids\x85good for settling the stomach and for nausea I find).\r\n\r\nT+0.00hrs.\r\n\r\nThe tea is okay, but the lemon grass is giving me some heartburn, which is making me feel quite queasy (I take an antacid and this helps a little) . I find it hard to get the shrooms down, even though they are crushed into tiny pieces. Usually I don\x92t have much problem. Normal tea with actual ground ginger would\x92ve been far superior and has always served me well. \r\n\r\nT+0.10hrs\r\n\r\nI nearly finish all the shrooms, just a few left the bottom. I\x92m feeling much more nauseous than usual (I\x92ve never actually puked on mushrooms), I put it down to the alcohol I had earlier, and to the cordial. I definitely wouldn\x92t use the cordial again. \r\nI\x92m already feeling effects and getting movement in my peripheral. I feel very giddy, and I\x92m getting the trademark \x92pressure effect\x92 on the sides of my head and on my temples (I\x92m pretty sure this is to do with tension). I continue to talk to a couple of friends online, which is helping with the usual \x91coming-up anxiety\x91. \r\n\r\nT+0.15hrs.\r\n\r\nBy now, it\x92s really becoming apparent that I\x92ve probably misjudged the dosage! After only 15 minutes, I\x92m getting some quite intense visuals. Walls are starting to breathe, I\x92m starting to see fractal patterns everywhere. I know I\x92m in for a heavy one, but I know there\x92s fuck all I can do about it, and I\x92m fairly happy and confident to just go along with it to see what happens. I feel quite apathetic. I\x92m not scared, but I am anxious. \x93I\x92m at the top of a roller coaster ready to plunge into infinity\x85\x94 - A common thought that goes through my head when I\x92m really starting to feel the effects of the mushrooms! \r\n\r\nEventually, I\x92m unable to type anymore on MSN. Words and letters are looking entirely alien and I it\x92s actually quite hard to see the screen properly at this point.  I\x92m surprised at the speed at which I\x92m coming up. I am fully aware that mushroom teas are extremely effective and fast acting, but at 15 minutes I\x92m already feeling like I\x92m approaching the peak! However, as I fumble around to put some more Buddhist meditation music on and go to lay down on my bed, I start to discover I am mistaken\x85\r\n\r\nT+0.20-T+0.30hrs:\r\n\r\nThe visuals I am now experiencing are enveloping not just the world around me, but they are delving into my very psyche; Every racing thought appears as a powerful visualisation in my minds eye. I am laying on my bed, the nausea is bearable, as long as I don\x92t move or sit up. Eventually I cannot make out any object in my room, I am absolutely mesmerised by this new world around me; Everything a swirling mass of colours, melting and morphing into patterns of indescribable beauty and technicality. The Buddhist meditation music is working absolutely perfectly, and creates a perfect synergy with which the visuals to dance around full of life and energy. I have never experienced anything like this in my whole life. I have taken LSD several times, 2ci, LSA, etc, but none of those experiences have provided such enveloping visuals. My thoughts rush, chaos is ensuing. The last remnant of my conscious mind tries desperately to resist, to regain control, but I focus on this, close my eyes, lay back, and let go\x85. \r\n\r\nWham!!!\r\n\r\nT+30.00-T+2.30hrs. The Peak:\r\n\r\n\x85Ego loss.\r\n\r\nI am totally unaware at where I am at this point. With my eyes closed, I am transported to this other dimension. I am in a pool with some kind of alien in some other world, two other Aliens are smiling whilst pouring a gold/red-ish liquid over us both as we lay down unable to move. Strangely enough, for some inexplicable reason, I am not scared in the slightest by this! I smile back at the aliens, as the liquid is poured over me. It makes me feel warm and very happy. Something is then said, but I cannot understand because it is in some totally unknown language, and I am then whisked away to another world/dimension. This part was very interesting to say the least! It\x92s just a shame I have a lot of trouble recalling exactly what happened. I made contact with several entities that were made out of pure energy. All were female, and all were very playful and joyous. Some were clearly children. I remember dancing and flying around far away planets and stars with some of them in some sort of cosmic dance. It was like a semi-lucid dream, only a million times more overpowering and spectacular. I cannot remember who I am at this point, nor do I care. For all I know I could be dead, but I don\x92t have any concept of death, nor do I have any concept of future or past. I am purely existing in the present, in infinity. \r\n\r\nI get the feeling I\x92m totally at one with the universe. It is total euphoria, I\x92m in some sort of state of spiritual nirvana. My physical body, and the physical world not only doesn\x92t exist, it\x92s been totally forgotten. The only thing that matters now is pleasure and pure happiness. I am living purely for the moment, and this moment is eternity. After dancing around the universe with these child-like entities, I begin to communicate with what seems to be their Elder. I have no idea what she tells me, but it does make me begin to remember who I was again, and this throws me headlong into a new phase of my trip which was extremely intense\x85\r\n\r\nI start to relive childhood events. I\x92m on a total mind trip (if you haven\x92t already noticed!) and it\x92s really delving into the deepest corners of my mind. It\x92s showing me mistakes I\x92ve made in mind-fucking detail, but also past loves, happy memories, friends, dead relatives\x85..All the memories and experiences that have affected my very character and being. They whiz past in seconds, like a giant super-fast slide-show, so fast I cannot make sense of some of them. I\x92m in total awe. I think about the friends and people that I\x92m surrounding myself in my life at the moment. I think about my aspirations and goals. I come to the conclusion that some things definitely need to change. That certain individuals aren\x92t helping me in any way achieve my goals, nor are they making me happy to be around. I came to these conclusions because the mushrooms had enabled me to let go of my own ego, and view my life as if it was a life of some other. \r\n\r\nI felt as though I had been stupid to not see this before, though instead of dwelling on this fact I instead seemed to focus on the positivity of such a revelation. And for one fleeting moment, I felt complete in the feeling that I knew all the answers to my questions.        \r\n\r\nT+2.30hrs-end:\r\n\r\nI start to come to quite abruptly.  It\x92s very strange, because it\x92s almost I like I can see myself walking over a line back into reality. It reminds me strongly of coming out of a K-hole. For half an hour or so, I just cannot move. I can make out objects in my room again, but the visuals are still extremely intense. My door warps over to one side and stretches back as if I\x92m running backwards down a long corridor (think the film \x92The Shining\x92). Sizes are still very much distorted, I look at my hand and the fingers just stretch out dramatically, I glance over at my computer flat screen and it\x92s completely warped. The fractal patterns are still running strong. Rainbow colouring over all white light. I am just trying desperately to make sense of what the hell just happened to me. I\x92m in complete shock. \r\n\r\nI think about trying to roll a joint, but every time I attempt to reach over to the tobacco, skins and the gear, I pause for no reason, forget what I\x92m doing, and get a barrage of thoughts racing through my head. 10 seconds later I would remember I wanted to make a joint again, but again the same thing would happen. I get stuck in a serious mind-loop for god knows how long. As I start to come to more I decide I need to piss, so I walk downstairs to the toilet. I glance in the mirror en route, and find that my pupils are so heavily dilated they have completely immersed my deep brown eyes and replaced it with large beady black eyes that stare back at me. I can only think something like : Jesus, what the hell just happened to me!?\r\n\r\nEventually I manage to roll a joint, and get myself together a bit more as the visuals gradually subside. I smoke the joint, almost to the end, but then notice it\x92s only making me very anxious and giving me some unwanted and unpleasant introspective thoughts, so I stub that out and decide to go back on MSN to attempt to explain to a couple of friends still awake what the hell just happened. This turned out to be a good idea since I could direct and focus the self-analytical thoughts fluently and productively. I talk about past events, and go through some serious self-analysing. I start focusing on mistakes; the time I was rushed to A&E in an ambulance because I\x92d taken too much amphetamine. The way I had got myself into a hole for about a year and a half through excessive speed/ecstasy abuse. I saw how I had a self-destructive trait inside of me, and reminded myself that although I had grown a lot since then I still needed to keep this in check. \r\n\r\nI then focused on how much alcohol I have drunk through my life, and how much I am still drinking. I become uncomfortable with the thought of what damage excessive consumption has already done to me, and this is where a friend online suggests GHB as a replacement (I\x92m going to give this a go very soon.)  By about T+6.00 I began feeling quite drained physically. I had a few glasses of red wine and I eventually fell asleep in an bit of a daze. \r\n\r\nI awoke the next feeling not feeling too great (too much alcohol). I couldn\x92t get back to sleep, my dreams were very intense and lucid, so I just spent that Saturday chilling out at home trying to recover and putting the pieces back together.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nIt took me another day or so to fully integrate the experience, in which time I was experiencing some manic behaviour. I also found myself very apathetic. I found it hard to go out the Sunday T+48.00hrs after this and socialise with friends in my pub. Possibly partly due to some of my \x91revelations\x92 about some of them. \r\n\r\nThis is probably a good sign I have been overdoing the mushies (3 trips in one week), and probably a sign 5 grams is over the top for me! However, after this initial manic period (lasting about 3 days) I did find myself feeling a lot better off mentally, even though I got a lot more than I bargained for with this trip! \x85.Introspect is one thing, but inter-dimensional travel, ego-loss, and entity contact is quite another! This was the single most intense psychedelic experience of my life. I don\x92t think I\x92d learn anymore from a higher dose, it would just be a waste of material. This is definitely my limit!\r\n\r\nEvery time I think I\x92ve seen everything magic mushrooms has to offer they surprise me again and again. I used to favour LSD over them, but quite frankly, this was better than any LSD experience (bar maybe one) I\x92ve had!  So for now mushrooms are by far my favourite drug! Perhaps until this summer where I will be experimenting with DMT and Mescaline. If those two substances can provide me with anything close to the intensity of this trip (from what I\x92ve read I\x92m sure they can!) then I\x92m going to have a very good summer! \r\n\r\nBut for now Mushrooms are my true teacher!"
114653,Depth and Intensity of It Took Me by Surprise,bongd81,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (sclerotia),"\nFirst Psychedelic Breakthrough\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND: This report is about my first real psychedelic journey which also proved to be one of my most profound and altering events in my life to this day. I had hardly any experience with drugs besides alcohol, but my interest and research regarding psychoactive plants and substances, ethnopharmacology and drug culture was in full bloom; this was my psychedelic springtime so to speak. I took extensive notes the days after the trip had happened and also expanded them with thoughts/interpretations about one year later, because it took me a very long time to make sense of this incident let alone integrate it. As I am writing this account now I again added bits to it according to my current knowledge, so please bear in mind that I frankly had not much of a clue about it all as it happened. I also didn\'t actually \'think\' all this during the trip; it\'s me trying to convey/describing it now. The depth and intensity of it really took me by surprise, so I would like to invite you to imagine the excitement and naivete of an unexperienced person in such a situation, which might render this report more comprehensible. \r\n\r\nDOSIS: The only delinquent in this endeavor were 13,6g of fresh truffles, psilocybe mexicana A or so called ""philosopher stones"". Beforehand, I had tested a tiny amount of the same batch to check for allergic reactions, then tried about 6g of it to perhaps get a glimpse of what it\'s going to be like, but that wasn\'t the case at all. The final dose I took seems small and I have since then taken triple that amount, but without coming close to this kind of experience I had back then. I can\'t really tell what caused that profound effect, but they (the truffles) went to work on me, that\'s for sure! I did not take any medicine, other substances, not even coffee or much food that day, had no tolerance to anything; my system was pristine.\r\n\r\nSET: I was pretty excited (in a positive way) and eager to know, to finally find out myself. I have read quite a few trip reports and was plain fascinated, but I had no clue how all this could be possible. Especially the potential visual component of trips was puzzling to me. While I was decently informed about my enterprise, I was also completely open, childlike, with a ""beginner\'s mind"" as they say in Buddhism because I had no reference point, nothing to compare to but words and therefore no expectation. I also was determined and reasonably at peace with taking the risks that might be involved in this e.g. \'going crazy\' etc. \r\n\r\nSETTING: It was mid to late summer, I had vacation from my studies and no duties for a whole week. I was alone (no sitter), had a house with a secluded garden for myself and minimized the possibility of encounters with other people as much as I could beforehand. Nature was lush and green, bursting with all kinds of fruits and flowers. Stable weather with clear air, blue sky with fluffy white clouds and lots of sunshine, 28-30 degree celcius. This alone made me pretty happy. I had my mp3 player charged and ready (with minimal electronic music but also calm stuff with vocals and some classical pieces), sunglasses, bare feet, bottle with drinking water, that was it.\r\n\r\nT+0:00 So I ate the truffles at once at around 10:30 a.m. On an empty stomach and a piece of dark chocolate afterwards. They had quite a strong taste, earthy and metallic. I am not going to lie, there was nervousness too cause I knew, once this stuff is in me there is no turning back. I started out inside, reclined on my bed looking at the wooden ceiling, no music yet, just observing, trying to notice any changes of whatever kind. One can\'t wait for something one doesn\'t know! So it was sort of a natural meditation (without me knowing it) one could say. \r\n\r\nT+0:30-0:45 Although it came on gradually, I was surprised how strong this novel physical sensations in me got. T+0:30-0:45 Although it came on gradually, I was surprised how strong this novel physical sensations in me got. Massive amounts of energy seemed to surge through my body, almost restless, building themselves up in waves which didn\'t feel unpleasant at all. My breath got really deep but not accelerated as I noticed the former parallel edges of the wooden ceiling slightly bending back and forth. My curiosity and excitement was almost killing me at that point so I decided to wander into the garden where the rest of the trip should take place; my last real \'decision\' for the next hours. Walking was no problem at all, coordination wise, but I had more the feeling that I was floating, without effort, as if these strange energies in me were canceling out some of my body weight. \r\n\r\nI sat down on some steps to the avenue of the garden. This change in scenery kicked things off in a rapid and radical way. My auditory perception was already noticable altered: as if every sound emanated right in front of me. The twittering from birds on distant trees and the humming of small insects close by had in and odd way the exact same volume and importance to me. My visual sense had also become razor-sharp; colors, edges, movement of branches and bugs, the most diminutive details (almost like I had microscopic vision) streamed into my mind without any strain, as if my cognitive bandwidth had no limits. I was hyper-aware, but this altered perception rendered my surroundings more and more surreal for me, especially the acoustic made the expansive garden feel like a small room. I plugged in my ear buds, turned on music which immediately lifted me up in ways I didn\'t knew were possible. A piece/song lasted forever! The details and time dilation reached a magnitude I only ever experienced with high doses of cannabis again. My blood seemed to withdraw from my extremities and they began to tremble slightly, but given the strong overall changes in perception of myself and the world, I considered this as reasonable.\r\n\r\nT+1:10 I began to notice that larger flat surfaces, like the wall of the house, the lawn and hedge started to expand and shrink. I think \'breathing\' is an apt and sometimes used analogy. My intellect was trying to keep up with these events, but it became increasingly harder to categorize or even dismiss this as nonsensical mental noise induced by some drug. There was something organic and intelligent about it; this phenomenon was really restricted to these larger flat areas, it was selective and became cumulatively more spacious and animated. As soon as I recognized that the \'breath\' of the lawn was far from random and was actually syncronizing itself with my own, my logical faculties started to bail out. I couldn\'t believe it, so I put it to the test: I took a deep breath and held it in. Seeing the grass doing the same, I began questioning a lot of things including my sanity! ""How is this possible?"", I asked my self repeatedly. It was perplexing, but only a taste of what was about to come.\r\n\r\nIncrementally but surely, the environment became real alien to me; the feel of ordinary reality was about to be reduced to a memory. The power, momentum and inevitability of this progression was very humbling and at the same time exhilarating. \r\n\r\nI started to perceive a transparent layer hovering about 35 centimeters above the grass. The way it rendered itself visible was analogous to a clear liquid, which is undetectable in a glass container but becomes apparent when light gets refracted by its open surface. This thin plane developed to a geometric selftransforming web, spread out all over the lawn which \'green-ness\' had, at that point, little in common with what we ordinary associate with the label green. It was a stunning, never seen before, otherworldly hyper-green; words really start to fail here. It was mesmerizing. Soon this layer gained in depth, became three-dimensional and was growing and coming closer to the grass. It turned itself more and more into an transparent fractal landscape, with mountain ridges and valleys, breaking the light reflected by the lawn and was transforming and rejuvenating itself exactly at that point where I focused my gaze. And it did so in an instant without discontinuity.\r\n\r\nAt this stage my saliva was more like goo than liquid and I still had the metallic after taste of the truffles. I\'m not sure, but maybe because my mouth was standing open for long stretches at a time without swallowing, due to my childlike astonishment. It was good thing that I had polarizing sunglasses on, because I also was staring uncompromisingly at what was presented to me in bright daylight.\r\n\r\nSubsequently this clear fractal topography expanded to the point where it actually merged with the lawn, it was oozing into it and at the same time forking it up according to its ever-changing patterns. The grass converted into an animate mass with liquid qualities and its waves and ripples followed exactly this lucent alteration-driving film that was still above and in it. There were also clusters of small blue flowers (Ajuga reptans) scattered across the meadow. As I looked at some of them, it felt like they were so happy that they finally got my attention and were saying ""watch what we can do!"". In a split second, these little dot-like flowers distributed themselves all over the lawn in a regular fashion that was again accordant with the overall morphing pattern of the scene. When I turned my head, they instantly sort of deleted themselves with a circular wave only to explosively spread out and participate again when in focus. It was mind-bending! The aliveness, effortlessness and unfathomable complexity with which my environment behaved and renewed itself left me without a doubt, that: ""This is not originating from me. There is simply no way!"" This was hands down the most astonishing and awe inspiring sight of my life to that day, but it was still more than that. Although it had a geometric and fractal character, it also was imbued with a kind of organic, radiant beauty and perfection only nature has. It was a delight to be immersed in all of this, but frankly, there probably wasn\'t any way to escape it either.\r\n\r\nSubjectively this went on for a long time and even a change in location (I placed myself right in the middle of the meadow) did not abort or even dampen what was happening. At some point this physical energy that was with me since the beginning started to increase drastically and not in a linear manner, but again in waves. Accompanied by this were spontaneous and radical shifts in my visual perception, as sudden as someone flicking a switch of some sort: on, and then off after some time. Within the \'on\' phase, my complete field of view became two-dimensional! But not like looking at a painting where there is still a viewpoint and one can move closer or further away. There was simply no third dimension left, no perspective, no observer, just a lively garden in 2D. This was as fierce as perplexing. I\'m not sure if walking would have been possible at that moments (because I didn\'t try to). In the \'off\' phase there again was a garden in 3D with vigorous soaring fractal lawn-waves sprinkled with autonomous blue flowers that on occasion could spread like geometric wildfire, all saturated with an transparent but tangible mysterious medium around me on the ground. \r\n\r\nAs astonishing and appealing this was, I also started to worry if I was on the verge of completely losing my grip on what was left of reality. Simultaneously these surges of physical energy built up to a degree of intensity that began to concern me as well; and also because they started to abruptly discharge themselves at their peaks, in a way I imagine a lightning strike would feel like. And their culminative energy seemed to increase steady. Although I don\'t recall any bodily discomfort or pain, the sheer power and intensity in my nervous system was off the charts and felt borderline. I discovered that I could disrupt the buildup of these waves by moving a little or averting my gaze, which I consequently did. It was the only \'intervention\' on my part throughout the trip and happily enough, this didn\'t deflect the positive trajectory of it at all and I didn\'t fall victim to anxiety (probably due to my naive and virgin approach). But to this day, I wonder about what would have happened, if I had (been able to) let go in this moments of exceptionally high energy/intensity. Also, what would my perception have been if I had closed my eyes? This didn\'t even cross my mind, because I was almost hypnotized by my view. \r\n\r\nT+3:00 The next phase, the middle part of the expierence, was more emotional, insight-toned and I think the word spiritual is not misplaced here. Although I doubt there weren\'t any visual alterations present, because the end of the trip was again influenced by them, I don\'t recall much of it due to the massive introspective impact it had on me. I also turned off my music at some point there.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this was a bit paradoxical. I was kneeling in the middle of the lawn (the dimension switching and the energy bursts had subsided), bend over and the sheer joy and bliss about the novelty, unlikeliness and otherworldliness of what happend so far was hard to bear. At the same time, a kind of desperation welled up in me (maybe an attempt of my mind to rationalize things): ""Why was I granted this magnificent experience? Who or what could I thank for this grace, this gift?"" and other questions like that. I had no answers. Tears were literally streaming down my face, snot, ..it was messy! This fruitless and (mentally) not pain-free grasping of my mind finally imploded on itself and left me \'shut up\' inside. Not sure if it\'s fair to say, but my intellect kind of went over the edge at that moment; and left this tangible but borderless stillness behind, which I knew nothing about at this age. \r\n\r\nAs I changed my location a bit (was sitting next to a small Rhus typhina tree and a currant bush), my attention was diverted to nature again and things got shockingly deep. Thoughtless contemplating my surroundings, I glimpsed that behind all this, the surface of things we so often simplify and only validate within the confines of our own benefits, operates a vast intelligence. The way the vegetation moved in the breeze, how some plants followed the sun and others didn\'t, the transformation of energy, the exchange of gas, the stream of liquids coming from the earth through the roots, the branches into the leaves and flowers and fruits, ..I could ""see"" it. The soil, the trees, the insects all over them (including me), the songs of the birds, the traveling clouds in the sky, the transfer of information everywhere, life everywhere; there seemed to be an organizing force or principle behind it! It was as if the self-similar character inherent in nature was willing to show itself, revealing the same patterns in everything. I was granted to recognize the grand scheme in tiny things and vice versa.\r\n\r\nSomehow I came to understand that ""there is nothing but change"". And what we call death is a natural and vital part of it. ""I too WILL perish!"" This was the first time in my life I was confronted with the certainty of my mortality without my ego\'s upheaval. I\'m not referring to this kind of sorrow or weltschmerz after an alcohol-induced philosophical conversation, but a deep-rooted fundamental fear and resistance that is present in every waking second I spend with this subliminal assumption of an autonomous enduring self. I was completly able to accept things as they were. The sense of relief and existential peace that came over me is beyond words! I found: ""There is nothing to lose, but much to contribute."" Despite coming to terms with my essential unimportance and nothingness, being outside in nature and genuinely feeling the interconnectedness with everything sparked a new wave of inspiration, wonder and true awe. It didn\'t matter that I was a mere dust particle compared to the expansion of the cosmos. In that moments, I knew to my bone marrow that the universe is not the same without me (whatever I am) and that I am not me without everything else. The comfort and bliss that came with this realization was unknown to me, but unlike before on the lawn, I now was able to handle all of it in utter silence; it was just streaming through me, there was no limit to it! If I came to know that I would be dead within a minute, I would have been ok with it, at peace. Certainly one of the most profound and beautiful experiences of my life, to this day.\r\n\r\nI wondered a bit further into the garden and came upon compost piles out of which humongous sunflowers were growing. At least three meters in height, right into the blue sky. Amazed by the scenery, it was there where I first noticed it; it felt like an unknown, novel dimension has been added to my consciousness. It permeated everything, it was omnipresent. To be frank, I had no clue about what that was at the time. Looking back, I was slipping into a natural and effortless meditative state that increased in depth. I was literally nailed into the moment. There was not even a chance of going off into the past/future or self assuring thought patterns or any of these mind made artifacts. I was experiencing true timelessness! The complete lack of mental noise (when one stops all measurement and comparison, the construct and perception of time vanishes) left nothing but the eternity of the present moment behind, which then soft of \'opened up\' and became immensely spacious and palpable. \r\n\r\nMeditators may know what I mean. Sitting on the ground, I became physically and mentally very very still. As if I was immovable, indisturbable, static, solid like a rock while I was entering into some kind of \'psychedelic samadhi\', for lack of a better word. Strangly enough, my eyes where open the whole time, I was aware of my surroundings but remained one-pointed. What sounds like a claustrophobic state to be in was in fact enourmously pleasurable, but hard to convey. It had an euphoric quality to it like I had discovered or was in the presence of something of immense value, and at the same time it felt secure, like finally being at home. The coming and going of the natural world was observed, but from a place that simultaneously saturates and transcends all of it, it seemed. It also had something indestructible. Very peculiar, and after a felt eternity (literally), this state somehow shook lose and my mental faculties gradually came back online again, which then lead to the last part of the trip, the comedown. \r\n\r\nT+5:30 I was anew sitting on the steps located at the entrance to the garden with a view of the lawn and a wide variety of flowers enframing it. It was past 4:00 p.m. (I had plugged my earbuds back in and was carried by calm music) and the sunrays were flooding in more shallow and bathed everything in a golden friendly light. My cacti and succulents in a hot corner of the house definitely loved it, I was able to sense it. The warmth on my skin and the feeling of my bare feet on the earth felt soothing and grounding.  \r\n\r\nAt this point, I still experienced remarkable visuals which could be described as \'morphing\', but not as a steady pattern, more in an erratic way that seemed to animate nature all around me. Most trips I had in the following 10+ years did not reach this level of visual alteration even at their peaks Most trips I had in the following 10+ years did not reach this level of visual alteration even at their peaks, but on that day this was just the comedown. It was as though the flowers on the edge were sitting in an arena in rows, bending and twisting to this side then to the other like they were gesticulating and talking to each other. Some objects became huge, others tiny, but always in a smooth organic way that didn\'t seem to violate physical laws; in other words: ""It felt absolutely real."" My mind was still blown by amazement by how all this is even possible, despite the fact that it was actually happening to me right in that particular moment.\r\n \r\nIt was miraculous, but I also got quite emotional. I was filled with a strong sense of gratitude, that both my feet were on the ground again (figuratively speaking) and no apparent harm had occured and even that there IS such a place \'to come back to\', a somewhat stable looking baseline reality that we humans inhabit and share. And yet there it is now, this knowledge of the existence of these other realms, these radical different approaches to meet or to be with \'reality\', whatever that exactly means. I was thankful that I have been allowed to experience such a profound connection with the universe, to have glimpsed what it\'s like to lose or loosen up ones selfhood, when fear completely drops away and to have entered the eternal present, although only for a short period (careful, paradox here!). I felt very in tune with nature, which induced the sensation of being cared for, secure, at ease and honored to be a part of something so marvelous and vast. I was somewhat functional again but I must have been sitting there for at least one and a half hours, watching the sun go down and the morphing diminish. Frankly, I also was exhausted too; the \'distance\' of this journey was too great for me to be able to wrap my head around it yet. I fuelled my body, took care of minor things and went to sleep at night (which was not difficult), still delighted and with a lot of newfound questions, but at the same time pretty satisfied. So the trip lasted for almost 7 hours, but a warm glow inside me carried over well into the next day. I didn\'t mind at all!\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: I decided to abstain from far reaching conclusions here and leave it up to the reader of this report, to make of it what seems appropriate or useful. Sharing an account of this intimate and transformative occasion, even though words are not the most able means to do so, appears important and worthwhile to me. If only one person finds it interesting, or helpful to make more informed decisions or prevent/reduce harm, it has done its job.\r\n\r\nEven if I would reject all the specific content of this experience, there is still one incisive undeniable insight left: The fact that such altered states of consciousness are possible! I can\'t speak for other people, but for me it was certainly essential to undergo all this first hand to be able to take it seriously. I think I would not have arrived there by mere reading, reasoning and speculation. \r\n\r\nOverall it was a remarkable and prolific adventure. It has surely not decreased my interest in psychedelics, but I regard this as neutral. What could be seen as a negative effect was that I had nobody to share my thoughts and many questions with back in the day, which made me feel alienated and (even more) different at times. Obtaining the truffles was accompanied by a bit of worry (to get caught) as well, but once I had them the rebellious and explorative spirit got the upper hand again. If nothing else, this event showed me a human potential, a door I didn\'t know was there, and it also left it a chink wide open. \r\n\r\nI wish you well, be safe."
110360,Healed Through the Fear of God,Shadow,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nOn a recent Saturday afternoon, I took another dose of Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms, 1 gram brewed in tea.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin, I will say that it had been about a month since my last solo venture, which was by far the most paradigm-shattering experience of my life. Despite only consuming 0.5g (what I thought would be a considerably gentle dose) I experienced what I would describe as a voyage through grid-like blueprints of futuristic cities of infinite complexity. These places were inhabited by small people with pyramid-shaped heads. This is a drastic oversimplification, and I\'m only mentioning it to provide context for my more recent trip. What followed was the feeling of a direct encounter with a being of supreme power who communicated to me through my own thoughts, which I committed to writing. The message consisted of a very austere introductory statement followed by a set of concise instructions. Despite having experienced hundreds of other psychedelic journeys in the past, this experience completely undermined the foundations of my concept of reality. Additionally, it seems that it blasted open the gates to an entirely new threshold of possible experiencing, which was made apparent by this latest dive into the mushroom abyss.\r\n\r\nI\'ll begin by stating that about a year ago it became very clear that in order to continue with this practice, I would have to abandon some dependencies on other substances. Pot was the first to go, followed by tobacco, followed by alcohol, followed by caffeine. I can confidently say that aside from mushrooms, I now live drug free, and I do not miss any of it. This change was based more on an unshakeable conviction or a feeling of total necessity, rather than a concern for my health or well-being.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I consider critical before dosing, is that I have to attend to any and all pressing tasks that I have been avoiding or procrastinating about. Things like paying bills, writing emails, maintaining my vehicle, cleaning the apartment, calling my parents etc etc. Call me obsessive, but I really feel that carrying any kind of anxiety or guilt into the mushroom trip will spoil it. I want my mind to be completely pure before I stand before the throne. Everyone has their own perspective, but to me, this is very serious business.\r\n\r\nAfter taking care of business and going for a short run, I prepared myself by meditating with my biofeedback monitor for about half an hour, getting my heart rate steady and ridding myself of nervousness and tension. To be very honest, after my last voyage I was very afraid to go back in there, but regardless I took a deep breath and downed the tea as quickly as I could. \r\n\r\nWith earplugs in and eyemask on I slipped under the covers into my cocoon. It began as it always does, after about fifteen minutes of controlling the breath and purging my mind of distracting thoughts, the first flashes of pastel colors began to dance behind my eyelids. But something was different this time. I noticed a strange irregularity in my heartbeat, which I am particularly sensitive to. To me the heartbeat represents my connection to my body, the familiar tick-tock that only stops when we sleep and when we die. It felt like cardiac arrhythmia, which is a sudden speeding and slowing of the heartrate. I tried my best to ignore it and focus on breathing to bring myself back to a state of relaxation, but try as I may, my heart would not stop pounding in this bizarre erratic fashion.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I realized that it was my turn to die. It was as if I was supposed to be this afraid, because the fear itself is what would ensure that I suffered, ensure that I embraced death properly. For it is not death we fear, but the fear of death. By now my heart felt like it was going to explode, and my body was trembling from head to toe. I felt cold as ice, like every ounce of life was being drained out of me. I always thought that death would feel like a sudden severing of reality, like entering into a void or infinite space, but no, death has many layers, death is an arduous process. It kept on going and going, for how long I can\'t possibly say. I don\'t think I\'ve ever experienced fear quite like this before. All I wanted was to be dead, to be released from the sorrow. The thought occurred to me: \'What if death can\'t save me from this, what if there is no solace even in death?!\'. It was total psychological torture, and all the while I had the horrific feeling of being violated and examined by invisible forces. In a whimpering voice I squeaked out \'Please be gentle with me, I don\'t want to suffer!\'. Strangely, this request seemed to quell whatever ugliness had taken hold of me. Whatever power had me restrained decided to show mercy and release me. I became aware of my body once again, although it felt very much like a foreign object, dead, not the familiar flesh I have carried around with me all of my life.\r\n\r\nMy heartbeat began to steady, and then a stream of the most hauntingly terrifying imagery I have ever seen spread out all around me. Occult symbols, sigils, hieroglyphs, cuneiform, flaming chariots, horned goats, snakes, angels, the kind of stuff depicted in William Blake\'s art and the writing of the apostle John in the book of Revelation, and yet so much more complex. The stuff of art and literature is obviously only a pathetic attempt to capture the real thing, or the experience itself, which I now understand to be very real. It was simultaneously beautiful beyond words, and utterly hideous, not the sort of thing that language could ever come close to touching. I was paralyzed. I became aware of a sudden urgent need to relieve myself, but there was no way I could get out of bed. Embarrassingly, without warning, my bladder simply released, and I wet myself for the first time since I was a small child. I don\'t know how long I remained there in the ecstatic stupor. Probably the best word to describe my emotional state was \'awe\'. Probably the best word to describe my emotional state was \'awe\'.\r\n\r\nEventually the imagery subsided and I regained control of my body, so I pulled back the bedsheets from my face and took off my eye mask to reveal my room again, drenched in the shimmering watery light of a beautiful sunny spring day. But I had never seen my room quite like this, it felt like seeing for the first time. Pardon the cliche, but I truly felt as though I had just been reborn. As is common for me, at this point I felt an oncoming wave of insights, seemingly from nowhere. My pen and notebook was waiting on the nightstand, so I opened it up and began to write. It almost appeared like the ink was touching the paper before my pen even hit the page, and I watched it saturate the fibers in slow motion as the jumbled letters spilled all over the page, which appeared to be made of radiant liquid light:\r\n\r\n\'Everyone on Earth suffers from the disease of history. Every act is an act of healing. Life on Earth suffers from a great collective wound, which consciousness itself has inflicted upon all people. Life is the process of healing this wound.\r\n\r\nHistory is the Expanding Mind. You have seen it, you are it. This Mind has been dragging itself out of the quagmire since the beginning of time. Suffering is real. There is no such thing as a blank slate. Every being sees through a spectrum of blindness. You have been spared from suffering so that you might see the mystery more clearly. This mystery is contained inside of you, and your very existence is the only proof you need.\r\n\r\nIn this life, everything comes at a price. You have been shown mercy so that you may help those who are less fortunate.\r\n\r\nYou think the measure of a being its capacity to know, but you are incorrect. The measure of a being is its capacity to love.\'\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s all there was. Forgive me, I realize how completely insane this sounds. It makes me seem like a megalomaniac and a psychopath, and by some measure I very well may be these things. It\'s entirely possible that this is nothing but a manifestation of repressed narcissism, or self-loathing, lack of childhood affection, your guess is as good as mine. I am simply relaying my experience as I remember it, for the simple reason that it shook me to my very core, and I don\'t have anyone else who I could comfortably discuss such things with. I hope you all can see that this is not some kind of evangelical rant. Up until very recently I identified quite resolutely as an agnostic, for the simple reason that I did not feel substantial evidence of a god or some kind of spiritual realm. The difference now, after having these two earth-shattering experiences, is that I\'ve realized that life itself, existence itself is fundamentally a mystery, one that I have largely ignored up until recently. I\'ve always had a interest in religion and spirituality, even entertained the notion that life is essentially spiritual, but never before have I felt such a complete conviction that what I perceive with my senses is only the tiniest shred of what is really going on all around me at all times. \r\n\r\nI should also mention that I seem to have spontaneously acquired a new kind of sense for symbolism and meaning. In art, in literature, slogans; it\'s as though what once appeared as two-dimensional words and pictures without significance suddenly has a three-dimensional story to tell. I\'m not just talking about proper symbols either, I\'m talking about EVERY object. Every object is a story in itself, every object has a history that reveals its development into the present state. This is the true nature of words. Candle, headphones, jar, book, seashell, lamp, pen, keys, refrigerator, THE BODY... all that is required to know the present state of the world is curiosity, because there is meaning in literally every single object, and they are all related to one another in some way. Words are the roadmap to reality.\r\n\r\nIt has become all-too-clear to me that for my entire adult life I have been running away from everything that is good. I\'ve unconsciously pushed away everything that is wholesome and uplifting. My family, my friends, my lovers, I\'ve hurt and betrayed them all, not directly through hostility, abuse or infidelity, but through the rejection of their love, or the incapacity to really feel it and appreciate it. I thought that I was seeking knowledge or some kind of window into absolute truth, when all along I have really been seeking to rid myself of pride. \'Every act is an act of healing\'.\r\n\r\n<!--If anyone else has had an experience like this, I encourage you to share it. I feel like that\'s part of why this place exists, I mean, I\'m assuming that most people here are eating mushrooms somewhat frequently. So please, if any of you ever need someone to talk to about this stuff, I am open and willing to listen and exchange words with you, I really mean this. -->It is difficult to be alone in an experience like this. Thank you for taking the time to read my report. Do not forget to love each other; love is what every person needs above all else."
98047,A Cleansing Experience I Will Never Forget,nemchet,"25I-NBOMe, MDMA & Mushrooms","\nPrevious experience: Cannabis, MDMA, LSD-25, P. cubensis, various amphetamines, 4-MMC\r\n\r\nMedical history: Mild bipolar disorder, ADD (hence I keep my doses quite low).\r\n\r\nSetting: A very foggy, damp day in a very ordinary city in the south of England. It is late October, so autumn is in full swing with golden & red leaves on the ground. Part of this trip was spent with my partner \'A\' at her flat some three or so miles from my home, the rest at home with my housemate, a first-time tripper.\r\n\r\nSet: Strangely enough, this trip was about a week after a 4MMC binge with my housemate. 4MMC is stupidly addictive, and I was in the full grip of its withdrawal. It was only just starting to wear off at the time of this trip.\r\n\r\nDose: Some days previously my friend \'J\' had wanted me to \'try out\' a new batch of MDMA he had just got in. \'J\' is very knowledgable about his trips, and I trust this guy implicitly. His partner, another \'J\', is a long time best friend of mine, meaning I get awesome deals on various substances anyway. I was sent a package with 6g Psilocybe mexicana (pre-ground), 150mg MDMA (which a testing kit revealed was extraordinarily pure, some of the purest Mandy I have ever seen in my life) and 250ug of this substance I had not heard of before, 25i-NBOMe.\r\n\r\nTrip report:\r\n\r\nT=0:00. It is 11:30 am on my only 2 days off for some time. I\'m excited, but apprehensive. I look at the amount of drugs before me unsure if I\'m going to be stone cold sober or a complete wreck. Only one way to find out! I snort half the MD off a CD case. I wrap the rest in Rizla for later. I have been looking forward to the NBOMe for some time now and decide to scoop the lot out of the baggy. It goes under my tongue. A very \'chemical\' taste, but nowhere near the \'bite\' of Mandy or 4MMC.\r\n\r\nT=0:10. I set out for A\'s house. I was meant to meet her at 11 and figure she\'s already gone home. I have a habit of oversleeping (I work late), she doesn\'t mind all that much usually, and today was no exception.\r\n\r\nT=0:15. The MDMA is kicking in really quickly, probably because it was snorted. I note to myself I\'m already quite a bit off baseline, a definite +.\r\n\r\nT=0:25. I can definitely feel something now. I\'m walking REALLY fast, like there\'s a hand pushing me, but there\'s something else there that I can\'t quite describe. Having read up on 25i prior to this trip, and its effects on natural colours, I decide to detour through a nature reserve.\r\n\r\nT=0:40. Some time dilation is very apparent, but so is the fact I\'m overheating pretty fast from how much I\'m exerting myself. I start to panic and freak out, kicking myself for not bringing any water with me, thinking I\'m going to dehydrate and die before I even get to A\'s house. I decide to sit down and bomb the remaining MDMA to bring up my mood. It does the job rather well. I\'m buzzing quite hard by now, a definite ++.\r\n\r\nT=1:00. I\'m getting quite close to A\'s now, although it seems like absolutely miles away. What becomes very apparent at this point is how vivid the autumn colours are. I see a huge patch of yellow leaves on the ground, and HOLY SHIT they\'re dazzlingly bright. I have to squint the colours are so... colourful. The anxiety from earlier is almost completely gone, and I\'m definitely feeling the NBOMe. I\'m getting some jaw clenching, but it\'s not overpowering; my face feels a bit tight, but that is all.\r\n\r\nT=1:10. I arrive at A\'s. There are cleaners about the block. They can obviously tell I\'m on something, and they sound very weird, almost fearful. They need not have been, I\'m quite happy and content. I\'m like, \'fuck how do I get in?\' before realising I have keys... Duh. Once I get in, straight away I\'m down to just my jeans and nothing else. Aaaaah, water, nectar of the gods. A\'s not back yet, but she\'s not far behind.\r\n\r\nT=1:20. A comes in and suddenly, I\'m overtaken by (this is going to sound weird) the nicest, best feeling nausea ever. I rush to the bathroom and spew quite hard. But rather than feeling disgusting, it\'s like a demon has been purged from my body. As soon as I come back into the lounge A starts asking what I\'m on. She\'s kind of \'anti-drugs\' but I\'m slowly turning her on to psychedelics and the benefits they can bring to one\'s life. I show her on Wikipedia what I\'ve been taking. She wasn\'t exactly approving of me trying RCs, but since I\'m tripping balls she at least knows the importance of a positive mindset and agrees to \'sit\' for me. The bonding aspect of MDMA really kicks in by this point and I\'m unusually cuddly and lovey. We watch Cassetteboy\'s videos on Youtube and by the end I am in some uber-happy-land, laughing my ass off. My headspace is extremely clear. It\'s at this point I notice that lights have taken on a prism-like appearance. Still ++, but still coming up. My pupils are... well, nonexistent.\r\n\r\nT=1:45. A puts on Reservoir Dogs. Probably not the best choice of film to trip to. But I\'m too spangled to care by now. Rather than watch the movie, I\'m completely distracted by some of the most amazing OEV/CEV I\'ve seen. Flower shaped, multidimensional fractals are starting to appear on the walls in colours I never knew existed. The light from the windows has taken on a purplish hue, which continues way past the edges of the windowpane, almost like a halo. I\'m also noticing auditory hallucinations, like an echoing buzzing noise flanging in and out. I catch probably five minutes of the movie. Doesn\'t matter, I\'ve seen it a few times before.\r\n\r\nT=2:??. I completely lose track of time. Quite literally, I spend the next few hours just marveling at the patterns on the walls. I get completely lost in the beauty and the multidimensionality of everything. The cats are so furry and tactile, it\'s the most fascinating feeling in the world. I\'m definitely starting to peak on the MD+NBOMe now. I am becoming one with the room and everything in it. +++\r\n\r\nT=4:??. I come off the peak a little, and nausea sets in. I haven\'t eaten in 24h, mind you, which is probably why I\'m tripping so hard. I rush to the bathroom and projectile vomit again (for the last time). Didn\'t feel quite as good as the first time, but still isn\'t that unpleasant.\r\n\r\nI have no recollection whatsoever of what happened during the next 3-4 hours, but apparently I was cuddling up to A and being very lovey (but not randy, just romantic) and talking utter bollocks about anything and everything, from why tomatoes were bad for cats to how we should dose up politicians with hallucinogens and watch chaos ensue. :) Everything was fascinating except food. I couldn\'t even look at food and it smelled foul. Even bacon, which I can usually eat and eat and eat, was just disgusting.\r\n\r\nT=8:30. I decide to head back to mine. I still have shrooms to consume and I promised my housemate a good time, so I get a lift back to mine. Coming down now, but it\'s not an unpleasant comedown. Definitely an afterglow with this combo, and I feel so happy and euphoric. I keep telling A how lovely she is and how lucky I am to have her. This is the first time she\'s actually seen me trip properly, and it\'s definitely opened up her mind.\r\n\r\nT=8:45. I arrive back at mine, a bit sleepy, and still on an empty stomach. I\'m loving this though, and don\'t want it to end. My house mate is out, I text to let him know I\'m back and I have something he might like. Texting is REALLY difficult, I keep misspelling things over and over. Still I get the message to him in the end and he\'s over like a shot. So we decide to boil the mushies in a lemon tea. It\'s his first time on psychedelics, so I give him slightly over half the mushies (3.5g) and I take the rest so I\'m not totally off my face.\r\n\r\nT=9:45. After an hour of watching comedy shows on TV, I feel absolutely jack-all. In retrospect, there was probably some cross tolerance between the NBOMe and the shrooms, despite being different types of substance (phenethylamine vs tryptamine). My housemate however is having an absolute whale of a time. He describes the walls morphing and the room extending to infinity, and his pupils are enormous. Mine are a bit bigger than normal, but nowhere near fully blown. He\'s probably a ++, with me barely off baseline. I feel a little light, but that is all.\r\n\r\nT=10:00-11:00. Feeling a little something off the mushies. We\'re watching Total Wipeout and decide the show is made for people on psychedelics; the colours are vivid and the background music takes on an incredible depth. Our TV usually sounds crap but on these it\'s like it goes into full surround with loads of bass. We\'re both starting to giggle a bit, and decide to go out for a walk. It\'s dark by this point, and still foggy. We did this a week ago on 4MMC and we were half power walking, half running across a nearby field. This time, however, we take a slow stroll, taking in the beauty of everything. My housemate is silent as a mouse, with no urge to talk whatsoever. The lights across the field take on an unusual profoundness, like every light has a meaning and a reason for being where it is. After a while we arrive at a canal lock and marvel at the beauty of the rippling water. The trees take on a fluffy, ethereal look. \r\n\r\nOn our walk back, I start to experience some OEVs while looking at the sky, infinite rainbow coloured fractals which, while faint, were still discernible. I remember seeing a face made up of these same rainbow fractals falling from the sky and disappearing below the horizon. One CEV was particularly interesting: when I closed my eyes, lightning balls would appear at the periphery of my vision, converge toward the centre, and a multicoloured diamond shape appeared at the centre of my field of view, pulsating and changing colour, before fading to nothingness. Again, this was pretty faint, I was probably a +, and could definitely tell the real world and the visuals apart. We decide to get more of these in future, and my housemate reveals he had some very profound and interesting thoughts and he\'d love the opportunity to try psychedelics again.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much the extent of the trip though; once we\'re back inside we\'re back down to earth. We decide to call it quits not long after.\r\n\r\nAfterword:\r\n\r\nWow. Just wow. While the shrooms were a little bit of a disappointment, the MD+NBOMe was amazing. Not quite the intensity of LSD, but still very enjoyable and entrancing. Even vomiting felt good, and the afterglow has persisted even till now (the next day). Some brain zaps, but I feel like nothing can upset or bring me down. My clarity of mind at the moment is extraordinary; I have written up this entire trip report in under half an hour. Words simply flow out of my fingers, and this is twenty four hours later.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the trip killed my 4MMC fiending flat. I can\'t even look at the stuff now. I have had a glowing experience with this combo and I think, used sensibly, it can be a great tool for introspection and bonding with others. It\'s also lifted my mood - MDMA always does - but never to this extent. It\'s really taken the wind out of me, I\'m tired as hell, but boy, was it worth it."

For this trip I wanted to test some limits. Fortunately, between the smart shops and the coffee shops it is possible to put together a powerful cocktail of psychadelics.\r\n\r\nPreparation\r\n18:30  T+0\r\nFirst course. 3 grams of Syrian rue seeds on an empty stomach.  Traveling light, I had no access to a grinder so I just ate them a pinch at a time crushing the seeds in my teeth.  The taste was not too bad.  This will be the first time mixing mushrooms with harmalin so careful attention to diet that day.\r\n \r\nT+ :45\r\nSecond course, packet of fresh copelandia mushrooms chewed and held sublingually for 10 minutes. These are a strong variety that typically give a 4-6 hr trip.  By now I am in my hotel room.  This is going to be the scene for the next few hours.  It is a small space, the bed takes up most of it.  I have no sitter, never have.  Once this starts I will be on my own.  By staying in the single room it reduces the opportunity for outside events to intrude.  My greatest concern on these trips is that there should be a fire in the hotel at the peak of the trip.  I know that at times I would have great difficulty saving myself.  This recognition always gives an edge to the commitment, there will be no going back from this point.  I turn on the TV.  One channel is showing a game from the US Tennis Open.  I think it will be fun to watch this as I come up.  \r\n\r\nT + 1:15\r\nNo stomach problem but my skin is beginning to tingle. Santana Abraxus is playing on the PC as my body start vibrating. I give my self to mushroom space. Very soon the mushrooms will be in control.\r\n\r\nT + 1:25\r\nIt is starting to get dark. I only have low lights on in the room.  Tennis becomes impossible to watch.  The complexity of each moment in space is too much to process.

Another packet of Amsterdam\x92s finest in this case Aztec XTC a new variety for me. In volume these are larger than the copelandia, four big caps.  I had planned to take them all at once but the effects are so strong I get them down one at a time chewed carefully, leaving the largest till last.  It takes 30 minutes, all the time the visuals are getting more intense.  Images come in waves.  Each time I tell myself \x93I have mushrooms under my tongue\x94.  I never fight the mushrooms.  \x93Deeper and deeper\x94 I say to myself.  I remind myself that I wanted this, that I chose this.\r\n \r\nT + 2:00 \x96 4:30\r\nI have stripped off and am physically lying on the bed but mentally in mushroom space. It is a sequence of OEVs followed by CEV dreams.  I feel I am lying on a hill looking out into this pixilated vibrating spaces.  Rather I am part of the hill looking out.  Because my trips are solitary I am free to explore the erotic aspects of psilocin. Masturbation is not necessary. The whole skin is extraordinarily sensitive.  Actual ejaculation does not happen instead it is total body orgasms these produce copious quantities of pre-cum.  For some reason the taste of this licked from fingers a wonderfully sensual feeling, triggers sexual images of great intensity: passionate embraces, mouth on vulva prick in cunt  -- orgasm, orgasm.  \r\n\r\nFor some reason my fascination with swearing returns.  I always feel this is a mild version of Turette\x92s syndrome.  There is a visceral pleasure from saying swear words, the way they form in the mouth, the roundness of the sound of fuck and cunt.  I have an internal debate on which is the most pleasing word. Fuck. Cunt.  Resolved, as usual, with cunt winning.\r\n\r\nAll this time I am lying on the bed, alternately sweating or shivering, except I can\x92t tell if it is shivering or really a deeper vibration.  I am having difficulty maintaining boundaries. I have a fear that the difference between the inside, this room, and the rest of the world will disappear as if the walls would melt away.  I give my self a mantra often repeated throughout this period \x93What is in the room stays in the room, what is outside stays outside\x94. By now I am talking to the mushrooms often using the words \x93we stay in the room\x94.\r\n\r\nI am awed by this beautiful universe that has been created solely for me, or rather by me.  It is amazing to think that when sober our brains construct such a self consistent representation of the world form our senses.  Take a small quantity of chemicals, release floods of neurotransmitters and how wild and wonderful the world we build.  I have to work at understanding I exist as an individual but usually I let the mushrooms rule.  I accept my teachers.  I let my mind roam, nothing is fixed  I hold my hand up in front of my face. It becomes part of a pattern that extends into and through space.\r\n\r\nEventually the time comes to piss.  This is always an event in a trip.  The physical process of emptying the bladder reorganizes the patterns.  The result, catharsis.  I haul myself to the bathroom.  It is dark but I find the toilet and sit down.  Patience is required but the mechanism is not yet unlocked.  Explosion, piss gushes out like Niagara and I leap into a different space\r\n\r\nT + 4:30\r\nNow it is time for Phase 2.  The mushroom trip will go on for some time longer but I expect the visions to damp down and the anxiety to rise.  With no one to talk to I plan to counter this by adding THC to the mix.  Before starting the trip I have prepared a bowl of bubblegum hash, finely ground almost to a powder. But I want as strong a trip as possible so first I eat some hash.  Not much, about \xbc gram, but enough to give a base tone.  I expect it to be an hour for this to kick-in but in fact as soon as it is in my mouth the trip changes, heavier and more intense than ever.  I am on the bed, the pipe is on the table three feet away, unreachable.  I chew gently on the hash and swallow.  The visuals have a different tone now, heavier, more earthy, but still psilocybin driven.  I sink down and surface.  Sometimes I drift for what feels like an age but turns out to be a few minutes.\r\n\r\nT+ 5:00\r\nThe trip continues with the hash effects building.  It is time for the pipe.  It is good that I prepared the pipe because it is all I can do to light a match.  I am sitting at a small table on the edge of the bed.  I put the match to the pipe and draw in.  I see no flame n the bowl and I have no idea if any smoke is going into my lungs. I keep on pulling.  Now I feel some smoke I keep on pulling until my lungs are full.  I hold my breath.  Is all the hash gone? Should I light another match? I let my breath go.\r\n\r\nThe result is instantaneous.  Any thought of relighting the bowl is gone.  My vision narrows down to a single point.  As I stand up the table ceases to be a table and becomes a vibration.  I fall back on to the bed pole axed.  The deepest most intense visions go on for 10-15 minutes.  I do not know who or where I am.  The room is there but only as part of a space continuous with me.  I hold my hand up pointing at the ceiling it merges and becomes space.  Breathing stops.  I deal calmly with the multiple voices.  Pathways open, thoughts run on.  How long can this last?  Reality is out there, outside this room, but in here is perfection, a true joy.  Peace no, there is too much excitement, change, danger.  But also balanced, edgy euphoric.\r\n\r\nIt must end.  For one I have a flight in the morning, I have to get some rest.  But the drugs won\x92t release me just yet.  The pace is slower and more mellow but it is not until 3am (T+9:00) that I finally fall asleep.  And my friends have one last surprise.  Right at the end, out of nowhere, one last seizure grabs my body, a pelvic thrust that violently twists the whole body from toe to neck.  And then the trip has gone.\r\n\r\nThe alarm wakes me at 8:00.  I am hardly rested but my vision is normal.  I stumble through my ablutions.  It takes me an age to pack and I stagger out of the hotel at 9:30.  That morning I stick to croissant and orange juice.  They serve a cheese sandwich on the plane and I have some coffee in the afternoon.  No flushing or headaches, the harmalin has been metabolized.\r\n\r\nOverall this was my most intense trip but towards the end I could reflect upon it.  Hugely enjoyable, almost terrifying.  An unforgettable experience of which many of the details are unrecallable.  Yet the thought also comes to me that it is not necessary for me to do this again soon.\r\n\r\nImpressions\r\n\r\n1) The Syrian rue extended the intense period of the trip from 4 hours to 8.  I was not sick.\r\n\r\n2) There is no way to capture this experience.  It has to be lived and enjoyed in the moment.  I never fight the drugs, relaxing into them, letting go, being there.  The experience of total fulfillment is real but afterwards there is only a shadow left to hang onto.  Basically, short term memory sucks.\r\n\r\n3) One attraction for me is the totality of the experience. Coitus is wonderful but for a man is so brief.  Orgasm happens, life goes on.  Psilocybin provides an experience that is as intense, that lasts for minutes at a time and for hours in total."
43357,Layer Processing,Epstein,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI began the day with a light breakfast and skipped lunch so there wouldn\x92t be too much in my stomach to soften the effects. Then just before taking the truffles I had a small snack to get the juices going. In the morning I had spent a small time meditating in silence in my room, maybe ten/fifteen munites. Just clearing my mind, calming my body. We had just over 30 grams between three of us and we divided it up fairly roughly. We didn\x92t eat them all at once. We each ate our ten grams in three portions with about an hours gap in between. In my experience this makes coming up far more relaxed and increases the duration of the trip.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour I just seemed to relax completely in to the big black leather armchair I was sitting in, comfortably numb and drowsy. The other two where like cut-out figures to my left and right, I was unable to talk or relate to any conversation for some time and any attempt interact ended before it had started with manic giggling. This seemed to be affecting Kelly as well while Chris in his camping chair slipped in to silence. It felt like the trip was coming in waves, each stronger than the last, each taking me to a new unexplored level. I tried to relax, avoid panic and let the waves wash over me. For the best experience I find it is best to stay calm and still and meditate while coming up.\r\n\r\nAfter watching TV for a bit I looked around the room and was suddenly jerked awake, I felt vibrant, alive and aware of my entire physical body. The friction of blood in my veins, the movement of my diaphragm, the tensing of muscles, the clenching of my heart. I looked down at my hands and was acutely aware of the bones within, I could feel the flesh sliding over the bone internally while my normal sense of external touch was reduced so every thing felt like cold chrome. Moving my hands became a beautiful ballet of stretching sinew and the movement left a purple trail in the air. Amazing.\r\n\r\nI was aware that Kelly and Chris were talking but was completely absorbed in myself. Closed eye visuals were crowding in. fractal shapes in cool blues and violets emerging from the horizon point and drifting towards and past my vision. The most vivid of these was four liner fractals that emerged from each corner of my vision. They moved in creating a square and then each line exploded out into a wing shape of misty blue. The whole structure of four transparent intersecting wings rotated and then sped past me. \r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and laughed, Kelly said I had been muttering to myself and was laughing.  Colours in the room were ecstatic, like vibrant paint with no shading between light and dark areas. Like drippy cell shading. We all started talking and during the conversation I found I could shift between the layers my mind was processing. To explain; there was the layer of the conversation, the layer of my own train of thought (completely unrelated to the conversation), and the layer of my physical bodily processes. I could completely immerse myself in any of these forgetting the other two but when I returned to the conversation layer I knew exactly what had been said. Of course I had been listening all along but it was like I was a little man looking at the workings of my mind from an objective point of view only seeing one operation at a time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we all entered a very active phase, we sprung to our feet and began to explore the room. I felt springy and soft and perspective became very distorted. Whereas before, when we were coming up, we were on different planes, now we came together, started to explain how we were seeing things and it rely felt like our minds were connected. We were finishing each others sentences.\r\n\r\nChris mentioned the clutter on the floor and it became a tiny city environment. We all put our heads to the floor and explored the juice cartons, plates, boxes, magazines and musical instruments as if we were tiny, inch high, people. The room really was a playground and we were tiny children seeing it all for the first time.\r\n\r\nWe started to talk about the notion of all we are experiencing at a given point being all of our reality. This seemed to make Kelly nervous and when Chris mentioned going down stairs she froze up, afraid of the corridor outside. For her it had become a void because she couldn\x92t see it at that point, then when we opened the door she said it looked like something out of a horror movie. Blood stained walls and peeling paper. She talked of a terrible sense of foreboding.\r\n\r\nMe and Chris couldn\x92t understand this and I tried to talk her out of it. I was still in a euphoric state, and I said \x93Being afraid of an empty corridor is as absurd as being afraid of an inanimate object like a \x85cheesecake!\x94 but even as I said this I began to feel uneasy looking at the expression of fear on Kelly\x92s face. The prospect of being afraid of a cheesecake seemed more and more like a genuine possibility. So much so that when Chris picked it up and jokingly thrust it towards my face a jarring spike of physical terror shot through my heart. It was there for a split second and was gone. I remember thinking how absurd this was at the time but the feeling was still very real.\r\n\r\nAll this time everything felt dreamy and unreal and I remember looking in the bathroom mirror and seeing my face In vivid contrasting colours like clown make up. My features were hilariously distorted and I didn\x92t recognise myself at all. At one point gravity left all of us completely at the same time. The wall was the floor then the ceiling was the floor, it felt like we were stuck on the ceiling and I remember looking DOWN at the light shade. Unsettling. \r\n\r\nAt the peak of my trip I stood up and leant on the wall, pushing my fingertips into it. My core was vibrating, my fingers were buzzing and I felt the same vibration pouring out of the wall, the room, everything. I lost my physical self, normal senses left me for a second and I rolled along the wall and into the corner of the room laughing ecstatically. I was overwhelmed by the profound feeling of being the wall, of the wall being me, of me being everything, and everything being connected by this vibration. I was feeling with a non physical sense. Not touch, taste, or even sight. I felt my sphere of existence in its simplest and most profound state, without ego, without a centre. I could not be afraid because I was no more. My friends were distant shapes looking at me, I knew they were people but I wasn\'t one of them. As this passed my memories flooded back like warm water. My self retuned to me."
20486,The Most Beautiful Creature In the Universe,Noregretseh,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nHallucinogens have fascinated me for half my life. I can remember this fascination began when I was 11 years old, around the time I began smoking pot. I guess this was a little young, but from then until now at 21 I have not been able to enjoy the talkative, chatty side to smoking as often as the introspective, philosophical and somewhat hallucinatory state the weed induces in me. I am known to my friends to shut off into my own little world when stoned. (Inconvenient at parties.) \r\n\r\nHowever, I was well aware that LSD and mushroom trips are on a completely different level to being very stoned, and so have been trying to get my hands on something to make me _really_ trip for 10 years. Coke, speed, ecstacy and ketamine have always been readily available, and I have enjoyed all of em, quite frequently. So I am fairly used to being in some altered state or other. But while all of them have their time and place, and are usually lots of fun, none gave me what I was looking for. None put me in the state I had almost become obsessed with reaching. And for some reason I couldn\'t find any mushrooms or acid anywhere. Where I lived, it seemed every other drug was for sale but the ones I really wanted.\r\n\r\nDuring my search for hallucinogens I discovered Salvia Divinorum. Mainly because it is legal and therefore easy to obtain. Yes, it is -definitely- a trip, a mind blowing one.  I wish to experiment further with it and see what I can learn from it, and I know that it is of  some great importance. But the experience is more educational than fun. All other drugs I have tried merely mess with the human brain. Salvia, I believe, taps into powers far beyond, at least for now, the understanding of modern neurology.  And all this besides, I found the effects to damn short-lived. I still wanted those mushrooms. I wanted to bounce around, laugh a lot, and see things turn into other things, and not have to think too much. I also wanted more time to explore.\r\n       \r\nSo when my two very good friends G. , D. and I finally got around to planning this trip to Amsterdam we\'d been talking about for seven years, the smart shops were first on my sightseeing list. A few beers on the ferry, a few more on the train, we\'d had a very pleasant journey. We arrived at Central station and, sick of carrying the bags, checked into the first hotel we saw. Then we headed out and hit the first coffeeshop we came across, and bought a bag of the first weed we saw on the menu. \r\n      \r\nThis weed was stronger than any weed we could ever have hoped to get at home. Despite being economical with it as we had been advised, within an hour of arriving we were ridiculously stoned beyond belief. Though the gear they sold was strong, unluckily, as we were to find out, that first shop was probably one of the worst in Amsterdam. Later on, after visiting one or two other coffeeshops, we regretted even setting foot in that filthy hole. The atmosphere got to us BADLY. For now, we left, paranoid and distressed, back to the hotel. It was a seriously dodgy place. \r\n       \r\nAn hour later back at the hotel we\'d all got changed and decided to start again. The journey had be long and my two friends were also still tired from a long drinking session the night before, and we all needed to wake up. So I visited the head shop downstairs and bought a packet of 3 Yellow-Jackets.(Ephedrine capsules) However, my friends were weary of these stimulant concoctions as I had once recommended some to them that had made them quite nauseous. (They had been too polite to tell me at the time!)  so I ended up eating them alone. \r\n    \r\nNevertheless, D had woken up anyway so now we would look for shrooms, but a small dose of mild ones, to be on the safe side. We purchased a box of Cubensis Mexicana with one and a half large shrooms and a few small caps. We took em back to the room and decided to eat them a little at a time, as things were already going a little strange.. Before eating the Cubensis, I had already begun to feel the yellow jackets kicking in- a sort of tingly, very talkative feeling, and my heart beating faster - more like a jug or two of espresso than anything else. I suddenly didn\'t feel at all stoned, which was surprising as it usually takes me a long time to wake up from a few fat spliffs. . I\'m not sure to what extent the Ephedrine affected my trip, but I am pretty sure I ended up tripping hardest out of the three of us. \r\n    \r\nWe sat there chatting and listening to music. We all ate 1000mg of G.s vitamin C, not for any particular reason other than we didn\'t want to get ill later on. I ate about 1/4 of my share to begin with. I began to fear that the room we were in was not a suitable environment to trip in - the hotel itself was far from relaxed, (ie, a shithole) and the room itself looked like a cell in a psychiatric prison, no more than 8 feet squared for the three of us. The walls were bare white except for the nicotine stains and dents, with a bright, glaring incandescent bulb fixed dead centre of the ceiling. There were no windows - just a small air-vent in the corner. There were two, steel framed bunk-beds, (military stile) with plain, white bedding. The only distinctive feature was an old, battered ceiling fan that didn\'t work. \r\n\r\nI kept telling myself \x93you get what you pay for,\x94 but inside, I was very worried about tripping in this room. Until the effects kicked in, when it all went just fantastic.\r\n    \r\nAfter about twenty minutes, we all commented on how warm it was. We agreed that this was due to the shrooms, and so, assured they were working, ate some more of them. Then, after about another ten minutes,  I looked over at D\'s bunk, and it occurred to me that it was made of rubber. I felt I could bend the frame with my hands, and so, ever curious, I stood up to try it. D gave me a look as if he was wondering what the hell I was doing. I don\'t blame him. I knew that the frame was not rubber, but it felt like rubber, and it looked like rubber, it even SMELT like rubber, and I could bend it. I remember saying to him \'It bends! It bends!\' G. stood up and said to me \'Kam, I think you\'re coming up!\' I sat back down again and said \'Well, fuck me backwards, I think you\'re right!\'\r\n\r\nWe continued to talk. We hadn\'t seen each other for a long time and had a lot to talk about. However, it seemed more and more that as time went on, our conversation became more nonsensical. While we were still coherent, we were talking absolute rubbish. All the time, I was watching D\'s rubber bed sway in time to the music and watching palm trees sprout from the steel tubes. The bare white room began to have a lot more colour to it. I began to see the green of the leaves, the yellowy-brown bark.  The music I was listening to was not what was playing on the stereo, although I could still hear the CD. We ate some more of the mushrooms. This was too good to be true. Everything I had hoped for. I for one wanted more of it. \r\n   \r\nAbout another half hour must have passed when I noticed G. was tapping on the walls and say \'woosh\' a lot. He told me that the walls were rippling when he touched them, and as soon as he said so, I began to see it too, until they turned into a tartan rug and were billowing in and out like I should imagine a trampoline would were a very fat invisible man jumping on it. \r\n\r\nI lay back against the wall - the wall felt like rubber too and my head began to sink into it. Then I looked up at the ceiling. That old fan was rotating. It was not even wired up, but it was spinning, and suddenly there was another one. And another. Five of them, all spinning, I decided, at precisely 5012rpm. The ceiling began to lift up and move forwards, like the underside of a small airship, with all its propellers. Then it was an airship. Then two airships. Then a whole fleet of them, flying overhead purposefully through the clouds as if on some dangerous mission, dodging gunfire from the artillery below. \r\n\r\nJesus, I thought. I am seeing whatever I am thinking as if it\'s really there. This is incredible. I was loving it so much I ate the rest of my share, plus the remainder of D.s, as he was feeling a little nauseous and didn\'t want them.  \r\n\r\nI can\'t remember what we were talking about, but while all this was going on I know we were all still managing to talk to each other with fair ease. We were still interacting. Yet I have never felt so in control of my own mind as I did then - I could turn away from the trip to talk to my friends, and turn back to the airships at will. If I became bored of the airships, I would see something else. I saw a million things in those bare white walls that night, but not one I didn\'t want to. I was in the drivers seat and could take my mind wherever I wanted it to go. It was like my visual imagination had been fitted with power steering, cruise control, and a turbo. Oh, and a DVD player in the back seat. When I closed my eyes I could see in great detail huge landscapes. Mountains, forests, deserts - all populated with animals of every kind. Anything I put there.     \r\n    \r\nThen about two hours into the trip the visuals mellowed a little and the laughter set in. We began chanting \'Fuck da police!\' and I began to roll around on the rubber floor in fits of laughter. We heard other guests on the other side of the door, listening in and wondering what the hell was going on. We laughed our asses off for at least 45 minutes saying nothing but \'Fuck da Police\' to each other, finding it absolutely hysterical. I could still see the airships, but \'Fuck da police\' was funnier at the moment. Eventually we stopped, only because the CD  had finished and someone had to change it, \'before the weasels close in\', as G. put it.  \r\n\r\nIt was then, getting up to change the CD, that I peaked. And here I got more than I expected from these shrooms, yet everything I had dreamed of at the same time.\r\n      \r\nI had to sit back down again almost immediately because I began to notice all the little imperfections in the wall, stains and dents, moving around to form many arabic letters. I wanted to read them, and tried for a few minutes, then suddenly remembered I couldn\'t read arabic. When I realised this, the letters melted away and everything sounded as if we were underwater. I could hear bubbles and whale-song, and waves crashing overhead.  As if pushing through cling-film, the most beautiful creature I ever saw pushed its way through the wall opposite me. It was enormous. The room seemed to have grown in size to accommodate it. \r\n\r\nIt was a huge, tentacled sea creature. It\'s organs appeared to be outside of its body, pulsating and turning. It shone a brilliant blue light that filled the room. It had seven heads, all of them smiling, all with huge, black eyes that seemed filled with love and calmness. The tentacles waved around the room. It continued to smile as I gaped in awe at it. \r\n\r\nAn overwhelming feeling of inner peace emanated through my entire body - I felt like this creature was reassuring me of the good in humanity, nature and the universe. It looked like it could have been a boss from one of the Final Fantasy games, but to me, it was the most beautiful thing in the universe. It WAS the universe.\r\n    \r\nBy now, I was aware that they were staring at me with a little concern. And I couldn\'t blame them for I can now imagine what I must have looked like. I was motionless, open mouthed, wide eyed, pointing at a blank white wall for what must have been well over ten minutes. They were asking me what I could see, and I was describing it to them, but still not taking my eyes off it. I don\x92t think I blinked in that whole ten minutes. I was still conscious of being in the hotel room, being under the influence of mushrooms, but I did not want ever to stop looking at this. . .this amazing. . .THING. I wanted to communicate with it. It looked friendly. But it had already begun to drift away, back into the wall which had now become a huge, rotating tunnel. I recognised this as the same tunnel I always see when I smoke Salvia.  \r\n\r\nAs the creature moved away it waved to me as if to say \'goodbye for now, we\'ll meet again someday, come and find me\' before it finally disappeared from view, giving a final twirl before vanishing completely. I was very sad to see it go, but the indescribable happiness for having met it far outweighed any sadness.\r\n   \r\nThe tunnel soon closed around it, and the wall became a spiders\' web. Spiderman\'s face appeared in the centre of it, and this was followed by the rest of his body. He began dancing around to the CD playing on the stereo - (I think it was Orbital but it was hardly important) with full disco lights, red green and yellow, with strobes, mirror balls and lasers. I began to laugh - it was a very funny picture. It was almost as if the creature I had met was saying \'Aww, don\'t be sad that I\'m leaving. I know - here\'s something you\'ll like!\' and throwing the image at me to cheer me up. (I am a big spiderman fan, and somehow it knew.) I got the giggles again, for the first time not being aware of my two friends in the room. \r\n\r\nAfter watching Spiderman dance for a while, the picture faded to white and I was on the floor. All the visuals had disappeared very suddenly and I felt fairly normal. Very refreshed, still filled with the peace and happiness of the sea-creature I had just met, but fairly sober.  D was looing at me - \'What do you think, shall we go for a walk?\' I looked up - no airships. Just inner calm the likes of which I cannot ever remember feeling in y life\r\n\r\nI did not stop smiling for a very long time. I don\x92t think I stopped smiling until we were back on the boat. We continued to have a great weekend in this wonderful city. \r\n \r\nSince then I have not tripped to that extent. I have smoked salvia a few times in the hope that it can shed some light about what I saw, and I have seen that same tunnel, but the Salvia won\'t tell me anything about the creature. It doesn\'t believe I need to know just yet. I\'m hoping to meet it again some time. Or at least feel the way I felt when I was looking at it. And I have a strong feeling that one day I will. Either way, my experience with P.Cubensis has to be the most pleasant trip of my life. I cannot wait to repeat it, and yet, I know that there is no rush. It will happen when the time is right. \r\n   \r\nI was very worried about a lot of things before I ate those mushrooms. I am not very well traveled and was in an unfamiliar place. What if something bad happens to me or my friends? What if we get robbed, ripped off, lost, killed, etc? What if we do TOO many drugs. What, even, if the shrooms wipe us out for the weekend and we waste our long-awaited holiday? Don\'t they say that you shouldn\x92t trip if you\'re worried about things? \r\n    \r\nWithin twenty minutes of eating the mushrooms, all of these worries were wiped away never to return. Along with everything else deep and personal that had been darkening my thoughts. All that was left was complete calm and happiness. I guess cleansed is the word for it. The mushrooms have shown me the inner peace and calm that every human should strive to achieve through life. Buddhism springs to mind, though I know too little of its teachings to draw an accurate parallel. But that creature, in a way, pointed me to a target. When I can feel as I did when looking at the creature, all the time, without the help of the mushrooms, then I know I have achieved my goal as a human being. Enlightenent, if I may say.\r\n   \r\nMarijuana, Psilocybes and Salvia have been growing on earth before, I am guessing, mankind. They were put there for a purpose - an important one. And they TELL this to me when I use them.\r\n   \r\nAfter finally experiencing the wonders of Psilocybin after many years of looking for it, I no longer feel the need for those man-made substances peddled out in the clubs. With them, I have always found that after a while the down far outweighs the up. Maybe I haven\'t been getting the good stuff, but these ones spring out of the ground, ready for consumption, as nature intended. I have learned that if I give these plants and fungi the respect they deserve, they can teach me a lot about nature, about myself, and others."
28624,The Devil Must Live In Mexico,Victoria,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI know this girl; she likes to pretend she\x92s crazy. It\x92s an attention thing, obviously. A fabrication created to grab and occupy her boyfriend\x92s attention, and the attention of everyone around her. To curl up in a ball, to whisper to herself, make funny noises, and talk like a baby. I believe she likes acting like this, and she wants to be preserved as crazy, as people usually do when they first meet her. I only know differently because I\x92ve known her for years, and know she is a sane young woman of twenty, attending college, balancing work and her social life. \r\n\r\nI am only eighteen, but I am older than her. I know that going insane is the most horrible thing that could ever happen to me. More frightening than the dark, or loneliness or death; because insanity is all these things. I went insane once; I bought the ticket and then drove myself there. It wasn\x92t very hard, and I had it delivered right to my house.\r\n\r\nA syringe full of Mexi-cub Mexican mushroom spores. I only had to pay 20$ for them, which is great considering they are said to be the most potent cubensis mushroom one could find on earth. I had been growing mushrooms for a while, and had gotten the technique down. I\x92d also grown a variety of strains, and noticed the difference between each one, allowing me to customize my trip as I wanted it. I\x92ve tripped about a dozen times, all on mushrooms of a finer grade than I\x92d ever seen anyone have around here. Great pride and cockiness comes with creating such an excellent product that makes other people green with envy and reach deep into their pockets to experience.  \r\n\r\nI should have known I was in for trouble when the spores consumed the rice cakes they grow on within 2 weeks; faster than any other I\x92ve experienced growing. They grew with vigor, intensity I\x92d never seen. Psilocybin, the active chemical in mushrooms, usually twists and mutates mushrooms, which means really gnarly/twisted/upside-down/inside-out mushrooms = super potent. These were all that, AND some were albino, which is both rare and beautiful. \r\n\r\nI tried the shrooms at a low dosage at first, with my boyfriend (we\x92ll call him Lee), my partner in crime and #1 trip partner. We had a night out with three of our friends (who weren\x92t tripping) and found the mushrooms very pleasant. Very visual, surprisingly clear, with a slight full-body numbness that freaked me out a little, but nothing I couldn\x92t handle. My boyfriend and me peaked together at the end of the night in our bedroom, and made love as we cried tears of pure love and joy.\r\n\r\nNaturally, we thought the mushrooms were great. \r\n\r\nSo it was only a few days later that we wanted to feel it again. This time, we thought, we\x92ll eat more. So we did. We smiled as we split a pile of huge albino mushrooms between each other, freshly dried. My boyfriend gave me the big ones. We headed for the beach down the road. \r\n\r\nThe sun was setting and the beach was calm and beautiful. We walked very far down to avoid having to see other people. The plan was to set up a small beach fire and relax into our trip. As we gathered wood, we could feel the onset of the trip and knew we\x92d better find a safe place to start the fire before it would be too dangerous and frightening for people in our condition to do. We spotted a half-burnt up log in the sand in a fire pit someone must have used only a few days prior. Giggling, we started to set up the wood when Lee stood up and pointed to something lying in the sand a few feet away from our fire pit. A swan. \r\n\r\nThe Swan\x92s wings were spread open most unnaturally, its neck was long and limp like a noodle, as if someone had strangled it to death and broken its neck in the process. One long clean cut from its chest to its abdomen revealed its guts, which had been pulled out and strewn to the side. This was an unnatural death, just as unnatural as a Swan being on the beach. No stray dog or bobcat at killed this thing. It was a sacrifice, to Satan or to something else just as wicked. Sacrificed in front of the fire pit we were about to use. \r\n\r\nI broke down crying, I wanted to do something, to cover it in sand or bury it, but Lee wouldn\x92t let me touch it. As I was looking into the black caverns which once held the Swan\x92s eyes, my trip came into effect, and the experience of being in the presence of something so horrible and so evil set my trip off in the worst direction; total insanity. As if seeing the violation of something as beautiful and innocent as a Swan made my mind snap off the train tracks, and I lost it.\r\n\r\nI walked away from the swan and started talking to a seagull perched on a wooden pole sticking out of the water. It flew away from me, but watching it fly into the sunset forced me to look into the sky. All the color in the sky was being sucked into the sun, shaped like a large pink jellyfish. The dunes behind us grew and the forests on top of the dunes turned black. The sunset was calling to me, singing to me. Children\x92s voices, softly singing. Lee heard them too, but was frightened. When I turned around, he was hiding beside a wooden wall set up on the beach as an erosion blockade. I followed him and sat down next to him. I rubbed my palms up and down on my jeans, as everything started to accumulate a rainbow glow to it. Looking up at my Lee, his face would become reminiscent of a renaissance painting and for a moment he would become one. He was beautiful to me, but the beauty of him was all I could grasp. \r\n\r\nMy thoughts were either too many or too few to understand. He said we were leaving the beach, that it was an evil place. He grabbed my hand and tried to force me up. I said I wanted to stay; I liked it here, but in honesty I think I was too frightened to move. Planes flew overhead and the noise from them was so intense I had to duck and cover to feel safe. I looked back at the sunset one more time, only to see the last bit of color be sucked out of the sky at a violent pace.\r\n\r\nLee was dragging me along so fast I would become tired and would want to sit and rest, but whenever I got a chance to sit and rest, my thoughts would become so overwhelming that they wouldn\x92t make sense. I was slowly becoming a drooling moron. Looking up at Lee again, he had a halo of rainbow coming off him, and then, his head began to melt off, vanishing into the sky in curls of black smoke. It was then I agreed we must leave. \r\n\r\nWalking, I didn\x92t notice I was walking in the mud, to me it looked like green sand, and the green sand became dead bodies, the hands grabbing my jeans and feet, slowing me down, which, in the sane world, would be the mud weighing me down and getting all over my feet. Lee saved me from the mud. We were almost off the beach but our journey was becoming terrifying, the wind was against us, the beach had turned black and clinging to each other, it was as if we were walking into the gates of Hell.\r\n\r\nOur apartment is only about two blocks from the beach, so getting home was the easy part, at least for Lee, who seemed to have it together, and was looking at me with worry and confusing. Looking back at him, I couldn\x92t remember his name, or where I met him. Who was the boy I was walking with? He certainly was nice to me\x85 I wonder if I ate the mushrooms with him, or if he found me and saved me? \r\n\r\nWe have to cross a main road to get the apartment. It\x92s a dangerous road, and where we have to cross the road is between the bottom of a steep hill and a tight right turn, both which cars are constantly zipping around on, nearly killing us heaven forbid we try to leave the neighborhood. We were crossing, when a fire truck started down the hill, lights flashing and siren wailing, like a child, I stopped in the middle of the road to watch it coming towards me, and once again Lee grabbed me dragged me away. \r\n\r\nI wasn\x92t having conscious thought anymore; I was running on motor skills, which didn\x92t include ones natural human instincts of self-preservation. By the time I was in the house with Lee, I wasn\x92t even sure how to have sex or be sexy anymore. Lee had crawled into bed, saying he was tired and was going to wait in bed until the trip died down. I stripped naked, trying so hard to remember how I used to be before these horrible mushrooms, trying to be sexy, but I think now I probably looked more like a grinning, drooling maniac getting naked in the middle of the room. I laughed to myself a lot. I might have been out of control, but Lee was bringing my trip down into a very bad place by acting sulky and moody, saying I was tripping to hard and he was fine. Logically, he couldn\x92t have been fine, he had eaten just as many mushrooms, but he swore he was fine and I was the crazy one. This made me cry and if I wasn\x92t in a bad state of mind before this made it much worse. I tried to be in bed with him, but he\x92d push me away, and every time he opened his mouth red triangles would spill out of his mouth and float into the air. \r\n\r\nI sat in bed for a long while trying to figure out if I was thinking or if I was just thinking I was not thinking, indicating I was thinking. I tried to remember my name, or my mom. But I couldn\x92t. Did I have a mom? What did she look like? My mind had gone numb. I knew weather or not Lee was right, and I had totally gone insane, this trip had to end; it had stopped being fun hours ago. Hours ago? Oh no\x85 this trip should have ended hours ago, why was I still tripping? I hadn\x92t even peaked yet! It was then I had the first thought I had in hours: I had gone too far, and I was insane. \r\n\r\nAll I had to do was say it, to admit it \x93Lee, I want to stop tripping\x94, before the words came flying out of my mouth \x93no, Lee! I want this to end! Make it stop! Please! Please I\x92ll do anything I\x92ll never eat mushrooms again oh please God let it stop!!\x94 I guess after all the denial and confusing thought, I was in fact having a horrifying experience and would have given my very soul to make it stop. \r\n\r\nLee perked up right away after I said this and brought me over the kitchen floor and told me to vomit on the floor. My body was so numb I couldn\x92t do it, I could barely walk. I was on my knees praying to God, forcing my whole hand into my throat until my fingernails tore it up, wishing that I could just throw up those mushrooms. Lee brought me two-liter bottles filled with water, which he helped me to drink, and finally, when it all seemed hopeless. When it seemed as if we were going to have to go the hospital, and go to jail, to ruin our lives so I could get some theorize and end up in the mental hospital, I vomited. I vomited up the biggest whitest mushroom I had ever seen. The darkest hour is just before dawn.\r\n\r\nLee looked at me and began to cry, he said my pupils had returned to normal size, and almost instantly I noticed the shift between what I had been going through and what was going on now. I was still tripping, but I could remember my life. I knew who I was, and who Lee was. Who my mom was, and what had just happened to me. I became addicted to this straightness and continued to vomit until I couldn\x92t anymore. I even began to feel pain again, indicating the numbness was fading. I didn\x92t sleep; Lee and I stayed up and held each other until dawn. It was as if I had been separated from him for a very long time and I had just come back. I just came back from a very long trip. \r\n\r\nI had reached a level of tripping that many will never experience, and those who do will not come back the same person. A level six trip, the point of legal insanity. Complete loss of ego and super ego. I had poisoned myself, and given myself a 103-degree fever, which probably caused some sort of brain damage.,Insanity is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn\x92t want to live there."
45023,Terror and Wonder at Stonehenge,Dioscuri,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nThis year I attended the Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in Hampshire. I\'d done shrooms quite a few times before, and despite having many glowing experiences, had never had what you might call a mystical experience. I thought the setting would be good, and despite losing one packet of mushrooms on the way, I was thoroughly psyched about the experience as I travelled there on bus, train, and bus once more. \r\n\r\nI drank a small bottle (30cl?) of whiskey on the way down while I read Phillip K. Dick\'s Second Variety (which was very good, but not particularly influential on my experience, I think). I was pretty tipsy when I arrived, but certainly a long way away from drunk and was feeling pretty lucid. In my experience being pissed on mushroom trips is not a good idea - not that it makes for bad trips, but for dulled trips, for me at least. The only thing worrying me was that I was just going down with my girlfriend, who wasn\x92t doing shrooms, and though we were meeting her friends, I didn\x92t know any of them so well. Still, I hoped the more isolated nature of the experience would lend well towards it being more mystical. Also, I\x92d done larger doses and stronger varieties than this before, so wasn\x92t too worried.\r\n\r\nI set up my spot in front of the Henge with my girlfriend\x92s mates and got comfy, while I finished my whiskey and shared a couple of spliffs. I was definitely merry by this point, but still quite lucid, and after I took the mushrooms (at about 11:30) I abstained from any other substances for a couple of hours. I did use some whiskey to mask the taste however. Stonehenge itself, by the way, was pretty fantastic \x96 a really amazing background \x96 but wasn\x92t the focus of my trip in any way, other than being something nice to look at. \r\n\r\nFrom 11:30 to 12 I wasn\x92t feeling any effects \x96 not that I expected any \x96 and continued being my normal talkative self, asking the people around me what they were into, and being a good little socialiser. Then, shortly after midnight, I started rolling a cigarette and kept getting distracted. I was staring into my lap at this point, making a windbreak, and I was getting increasingly annoyed at my uncharacteristic inability to make a bit of paper and tobacco hang together. I looked up at the guys around me, about to tell them this, and suddenly the shrooms hit me, very fast and very hard. \r\n\r\nI giggled uncontrollably, and thought to myself about how I always forget what they\x92re like in between taking them. My \x91mushroom\x92 persona, in contrast with my normal persona, is very quiet, very unable and unwilling to speak, very absorbed in thought, and very confused by language as a whole. I also, on mushrooms, feel terrified at constructing sentences (they seem like such a commitment, with a beginning, middle, and end) and completely at a loss as to normal social behaviour. This is in contrast to many of my friends who talk uncontrollably and excitedly throughout their trips. These lead me to conclude that above all else, mushrooms affect me as a deconditioning agent, removing all my ingrained responses that I carry out with ease and without thought. All these symptoms hit me at once, at about 12:10, when I stopped concentrating on rolling my cigarette, and blew me away. They were accompanied by the usual enhanced awareness of colours and light.\r\n\r\nFor about half an hour after this, I sat listening to the people around me, in a state of great mental excitement, thoroughly delighted to have come back to mushrooms once again. At the same time I felt quite awkward talking to people around me \x96 there was another girl there, who I didn\x92t know at all, who was on mushrooms, and I felt I wanted to tell her everything about my experience, because surely she\x92d understand. I lacked the verbal faculties to do this however, so contended myself with attempting very basic conversation (\x93Hi, what\x92s your name, where are you from, what kind of thing do you listen to\x94, etc.) with the people around me, though this was more for experimental reasons than desire to be social. I was curious to find out how people \x96 who seemingly conducted conversations without having to worry and scrutinise the words they were putting together, unlike beshroomed me \x96 acted towards strangers speaking to them. \r\n\r\nThough this was interesting, it also stopped me concentrating particularly on the trip, and brought me down to earth a little.\r\n\r\nAround 1am, my girlfriend returned from a little walk she\x92d taken, and began talking to her friends. The things she said and the way she behaved I found absolutely hilarious, and couldn\x92t stop laughing, even though no-one else was. Not hilarious in a bad way, just really extrovert and easy and unafraid of saying personal or potentially shocking things, and all in a really happy excited way. I then realised she wasn\x92t on mushrooms. \r\n\r\nMy girlfriend ALWAYS behaves in the above way on mushrooms, and when it occurred to me she hadn\x92t taken any that night, I was stunned. And then I realised. My prior beliefs about my girlfriend\x92s behaviour on mushrooms had been less an indication of her behaviour on mushrooms than on *my* perceptions of her when *I\x92m* on mushrooms (I\x92d never done them in her company before without her also having taken them). This thought caused me great amusement.\r\n\r\nThe visuals at this point were mild, and quite non-specific. Colours were bright, faces were interesting, the world seemed (slightly) oppressive but also (very) exciting. I also (as you might expect given shrooms\x92 deconditioning effects on me) found myself looking at things and trying to work out what they were, as if seeing them for the first time. Patterns on my clothes and on other people\x92s clothes fascinated me, as if I\x92d never properly looked at them before.\r\n\r\nOnce my girlfriend arrived, the socialising continued, but I took more of step back and got a proper opportunity to look at normal behaviour without having to commit myself to conversations. Eventually, around 1am, conversation settled down and people started to huddle up (it was very cold). At this point, I noticed a glint in my girlfriend\x92s eyes \x96 the normal kind of glint I get from light reflecting off a shiny surface. I looked at this harder, and the first truly impressive visuals of the trip began. As I gazed at the glint, it turned into a wide circle, that seemed to expand as I looked at it. As I looked into this circle, I saw complex 2-dimensional structures, that looked somewhere between biological and man-made: circles passing rapidly along straight tubes, circles made up of a gridwork of other circles and of lines, the kinds of thing I might see under a microscope, except they were changing very rapidly and also looked very well finished off and clearly delineated \x96 hence not entirely biological. They resembled some closed eye visuals I\x92d had before, except I was able to focus on them and watch them very closely with my eyes open and in good light. They seemed to be partly on the surface of my eyes however, and were filled with radiant colours. \r\n\r\nI demanded my girlfriend sit still in the same position with her eyes open while I did this, which she quickly bored of, and despite my pleas to remain in the position, she lay down and went to sleep between my legs.\r\n\r\nThough these visuals may not sound so impressive, they beat pretty much every other visual I\x92ve had on mushrooms (except possibly one time in Amsterdam when I went out into a hotel corridor and the whole thing collapsed into a homogenous very rapidly moving mass all around me). They were so clear, so complex, and look so \x91other\x92 \x96 not like the distortions of normal objects and blending and moving of patterns I\x92m accustomed to on mushroom trips. I was very upset when my girlfriend went to sleep, but I understood she was cold, and was still trying to get to grips with what I\x92d seen.\r\n\r\nAs my girlfriend went to sleep (around 1:30), I rolled another small spliff, and took a few tokes every few minutes. This seemed to potentiate the visuals around me, and I started to see a marvellous \x91blending\x92 as people passed between the little hairs hanging down in front of my eyes (I have quite long hair). They seemed to move past these hairs not walking, but \x91morphing\x92, seemed to expand until they were on the other side of the hairs, at which point the body still left behind would contract to catch them up. It seemed like an effect I\x92ve seen on many films and TV shows, but unfortunately I can\x92t remember any specific examples. \r\n\r\nAnother way to describe it might be that their bodies seemed to lose specific surface features as they moved past the hairs interposing my line of vision towards them, becoming a blend of their colours rather than their shapes, and definitely stretching out until they were fully past the hair(s) in question, contracting again once they reached the other side. This was accompanied by a feeling of fear, as this was a very powerful hallucination, and one that was uncontrollable (unlike the powerful hallucination from my girlfriend\x92s eyes, which required my focus).\r\n\r\nThis feeling of fear made me panic a little. I\x92ve never developed a full blown panic on mushrooms (though I have on weed, funnily enough) and my friends have been warning me repeatedly that I would develop one sooner or later. I now began to probe at the various worries and niggles that had been on my mind prior to the trip. They weren\x92t particularly huge, and were quite paranoid one, and didn\x92t bother me excessively in my normal life - if I\x92d had any serious problems on my mind, I wouldn\x92t have done shrooms till they were sorted out. So I probed the weaknesses of my contentment like poking a mouth ulcer, keen to flush out any potential panics in a \x91controlled\x92 fashion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, and predictably, this had the exact opposite effect. I quickly started to have new, paranoid thoughts about all my little worries, and given there was no-one there who was awake who I could talk to, I had to deal with them on my own. Being eminently suggestible on mushrooms, I quickly convinced myself of various nightmare scenarios. Every time this would happen, I\x92d force the ideas out of my head, dismissing them, without taking the time to rationally explain to myself why they were ridiculous. Initially, this pushing away seemed to work just fine, but pretty quickly the paranoia started to gain the upper hand, as my paranoid half kept challenging myself to properly prove why they were ridiculous, which my \x91reassuring\x92 half kept failing to do (out of a worry that it wouldn\x92t be able to), and so kept pushing them out of my head whilst thinking \x91ridiculous, paranoid, mushroom induced\x92. They were of course, but I needed to actually convince myself of this rather than just explaining why I was doing it.\r\n\r\nAs the paranoid worries started to gain the upper hand, and people around me started to \x91morph\x92 ever more violently, I finally let the reassuring and suppressing half of myself surrender \x96 \x91whatever is coming, let it come\x92, I thought and prepared myself for a wave of panic and the full-blown fear.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next is the trip\x92s mystical component. As I finally surrendered, my train of thought was suddenly filled by myself explaining everything. Not pushing away, or suppressing, but explaining exactly why I\x92d been pushing away and suppressing, why I\x92d been worrying, and encompassing everything about my fear in about 10 seconds of thought. I wasn\x92t thinking these ideas for myself \x96 I was fucked and scared, and in no place to be rational. It was ME having these thought, it was MY train of thought, yet a different part of me, a wholly calm, wholly rational, wholly truthful part of myself, which interrupted my ability to think while its words washed over me, every one of them entirely true, entirely explaining the way I\x92d been thinking and behaving, without putting forth an argument or trying to convince myself of anything \x96 a synthesis to the thesis/antithesis, worry/reassurance game I\x92d been playing for the last forty five minutes. \r\n\r\nIt felt like it could not have come from me at all \x96 its tone could not have been more removed from my mindstate \x96 and as the words came into my head they seemed in themselves \x96 beyond their actual meaning \x96 overwhelmingly soothing and reassuring, but in a way that eliminated worry by encompassing it.\r\n\r\nI wasn\x92t thinking verbally during this ten seconds or so, just feeling and responding, but my first verbal thought was SOPHIA. Truth, divine wisdom, whatever you want to call it, yet intrinsic to consciousness and thought itself. Yet this act of naming interrupted the flow \x96 though reassuring seems too crude, it felt almost like it came as Sophia was passing away \x96and the reassuring words slowly ebbed away, though their last signified was that the reason they were doing so was my return to normal thought, the thought based on thesis and antithesis rather than synthesis, dialectical rather than holistic understanding. Thus the retreat of this wisdom did not frighten me.\r\n\r\nI was left for a while trying to digest this experience. I was tremendously excited, knowing that I had had my first full blown mystical experience on hallucinogenic drugs, and wondering how this could possibly fit into my general belief system. My belief system is heavily based on my passion and area of study \x96 philosophy of mind \x96 and whilst this isn\x92t the time or place to conduct an exegesis, there were aspects of the experience that seemed entirely coherent with my ideas, yet incoherent at the same time, and not only in different topics of my belief system. In particular, my belief system is inevitably a thesis, a proposition, an argument, yet the words that I heard could not have been more obviously removed from a particular point of view \x96 they seemed to embrace all of them.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the trip was unspectacular. One thing to note is the time dilation \x96 it felt like hours had passed, and I was convinced it must be four or five. At this point a very powerful chill descended, and I realised I was absolutely freezing. My girlfriend woke up at the cold, and we began walking around very briskly, my teeth chattering frantically, and my body shaking in the cold. Then, briefly, a ridiculous but primordial panic hit me. Thinking it was about four or five, and having heard shouts a few moments earlier, I thought the sun was about to rise. But as we walked around, and it seemed to get colder, the thought flashed through my head \x96 \x91what if it doesn\x92t rise?\x92. Ridiculous, but quite probably the deepest fear of man for many centuries prior. This fear lasted a few seconds, however, and when I checked the time, it was only 2:30. 2:30!!! How could it be? But this reassured me \x96 it was one of the coldest parts of the night, and the sun wasn\x92t about to rise for a couple of hours.\r\n\r\nFeeling like I wanted to restore my senses and digest the experiences I\x92d had, I decided to eat some food and smoke some tobacco, and this began to bring me gently out the trip, and I found myself talking quite naturally to strangers around me, though there was still the open-mouthed amusement and confusion of mushrooms. The next couple of hours seem to blur into one, but when the sun did rise, it was spectacular. First came a little sunlight, illuminating the deep and thick mist surrounding Stonehenge on all sides, and then as the sun rose, it seemed to boil this mist away before my eyes. It was a beautiful view for anyone, but the mushrooms enabled to actually sit and watch for a long time without getting bored.\r\n\r\nI was still very cold and a little damp, as was my fair lady, so we left quite early and climbed into a warm bus on the way home, sleeping on the way. The journey back was very peaceful, warm, and comforting, and as I nibbled more food on the way home, I felt a great sense of contentment and happiness, as well as a growing *confident* curiosity about the night before, rather than the goggle-eyed Alice in Wonderland curiosity of the trip.\r\n\r\nSo \x96 conclusions. I won\x92t go into my thoughts on the \x91mystical\x92 component other than to say it was the most overwhelmingly positive 10 seconds I\x92ve ever had on mushrooms, though even that wholly fails to do it any kind of justice. The setting as a whole was a bit cold and uncomfortable It was certainly a factor in my \x91fear\x92, even though it was probably also a factor in inducing the mystical component of the trip. \r\n\r\ny mindset beforehand was good, and I think if I had been feeling seriously worried about commitments I had in the near future or actual problems looming over me, then the fear might not have been averted. The setting was very pretty. Being surrounded by strangers certainly didn\x92t help, nor did the fact that I knew well no-one else there on mushrooms. Still, the solitary nature of the middle part of the trip probably helped the mystical side \x96 but it would have been better to be alone with my girlfriend asleep, and no-one else there, than lots of people I didn\x92t know at all. It certainly made the whole thing a lot more intense."
22855,Verbal Thoughts Run Riot; Bubbles Beautiful,JPH,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nMy second trip on Philosopher\x92s Stones: a mixed experience to say the least.\r\n\r\nPhilosopher\x92s Stones are fresh Psilocybe Mexicana Truffles (apparently they are not-yet-fruited Mexicana magic mushrooms). Very similar to magic mushrooms, the main psychoactive compounds are psilocybin and psilocin, although there are thought to be other alkaloids present which influence a trip, as with many other magic mushrooms. The big advantage of the \x91Stones is that they are legal in the UK (I don\x92t know where else), and unlike magic mushrooms they resemble a nutty tasting breakfast cereal, although after drying they become very hard, and class A/schedule I!\r\n\r\nAfter my first trip on \x91Stones, which became a bad trip when my friend was sick and we had to hide it from my Mum for the day, I was eager to trip again in a safer place so that I could enjoy the experience more. My friend D. had a free flat, and our friends J. and Bonham were eager to trip, so we arrived at about two o\x92clock and set the place up. I had planned to look at some art books, listen to music, and explore closed and open eye visuals, I also hoped to gain some insight into life, if possible. \r\n\r\nFor my first trip I had taken 5 grams of fresh Philosopher\x92s Stones, and despite the external problems that led to a bad trip, I felt quite comfortable to take a larger dose for this trip because we were in a much safer place. I was also eager to have a powerful, insightful, visual experience. I decided to double dose, so I ate 10 grams worth of fresh \x91Stones, which had since been dried.  \r\n\r\nAfter chewing them down with water I sat back to wait for the effects. As before I rapidly became aware of an anxious feeling, quite physical in my stomach, and quite emotional at the same time for the rest of me. I did feel slightly nauseous, but this time we each had a bucket encase any of us needed to throw, none of us did. Within about 15 minutes I had subtly altered visual perception and a slight loss of coordination. I also felt somehow lighter and when I moved I seemed carry momentum. \r\n\r\nFrom about half an hour onwards I noticed that my visual perception had changed quite a bit, with colours looking brighter, and the beginning of the pseudo slow-motion vision that occurs when I trip.  Everything looked slightly different, and although it is hard to say why, I think that everything begins to look \x91larger than life\x92. I later realised why bubbles in water look so strange and beautiful. The bubbles made from splashing water are all normally slightly irregular, and when sober you can perceive this. However I realised that whilst tripping these irregular bubbles looked perfectly circular to me, and this feature combined with their crystal-like reflection of light made them once again one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. Everything else I looked at whilst tripping had a subtly smoothed and unnaturally regular shape and outline, so that everything looked almost fake, and combined with the brighter colours that everything possessed objects seemed to be almost cartoonish to me.   \r\n\r\nAfter half an hour I was having the best visuals of my life. Everything was really looking bright and beautiful, and things were moving, breathing, pulsing and flowing, especially complex patterns. If I focused on any object, like a T.V., it would breathe and morph, only slightly, but this hadn\x92t occurred on my first trip. I also saw incredible sparkles and star patterns in my near periphery vision, often on white surfaces, which disappeared when I looked directly at them. Complex fractal patterns of bright shimmering colours were also visible, again often in my periphery vision. However the best visuals I got were from a patterned sleeping bag. The vine like pattern seemed to grow and move, like in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, where the flowery vine like pattern on the floor grows, except for me it never the left the sleeping bag, unlike in the film where it crawled up the walls. It was the coolest thing I have ever seen though.\r\n\r\nI decided to go outside as it was a beautiful sunny day and the flat had a small patio garden, with some lovely bright flowers and bushes. I took my music and art books outside, and by this time I was definitely tripping, so I told my friends who had taken their \x91Stones a while after me. I lost the anxious feeling around this time, and as my visual perception changed further I really started to think that I was in for a good time. I was feeling happy, if a tiny bit apprehensive. I tried looking at my art books, but soon found that I was unable to concentrate on them because thoughts were flying through my mind at a greatly increased rate and I would get distracted by anything and everything. My mind\x92s sensory filters had lowered their defences. I then listened to two of my favourite songs, and despite many lapses of concentration I was amazed to hear the music in a way that I have never heard it before. It sounded more emotional, more real and apparent, and I could pick out bits of music (certain small, quiet guitar riffs) that I had never heard before.\r\n\r\nWhen outside I remembered about closed eye visuals, so I sat back with my music and closed my eyes: I was amazed. On my last trip I didn\x92t have the chance to close my eyes, so I was stunned to be confronted with amazing fractal patterns, 3-dimensional shapes, and at one time a deep-red tunnel through which I was seemingly travelling. I also saw incredible patches of various bright colours move around my field of vision, twirling round and round like fireworks leaving tracers. One of the most interesting things was the range of colours I saw; I have never experienced anything like it. Everything was so crystal clear, so beautiful.  \r\n\r\nI soon became aware that my mind was really beginning to speed up, and I began to become more and more conscious of \x91planning\x92 thoughts.  I\x92m not sure whether it was my sub-conscious coming through, or whether it was just my mind thinking in an altered way, but my mind\x92s internal dialogue would talk through everything I thought about in the minutest detail. The best way to describe this is that I experienced many thought trains that would go off on random tangents, never to return to the original point. They were often about many stupid trivial things, for instance whether to eat a banana or not. I have found this to be one of the most uncomfortable things about tripping. I can\x92t relax or concentrate, and I spend a lot of time and energy playing games with my mind, endlessly talking things through, going back and forth over what to do, often changing decisions and points of view rapidly. At this time, similar to my first trip, this almost compulsive internal dialogue was just annoying and often funny, but it soon got worse.  \r\n\r\nMy trip turned bad whilst I was outside. It rapidly became apparent that I was going to be well fucked. I wasn\x92t yet fully under the influence of the \x91Stones, but the whole experience was becoming too intense, and I was loosing control of my mind, I was also loosing happiness fast. I think if I had taken action I might have been able to prevent this bad part of the trip, but by this time I was too overwhelmed to do much. I think the main thing that triggered the bad trip was becoming unhappy and scared. I now really appreciate that psychedelics must be used with great care if you are in any way not a happy, confident person. \r\n\r\nWhilst outside I also became aware of my breathing, and it felt like I couldn\x92t breath properly, because it felt like I was breathing more deeply than normal, and it almost felt as though I needed to breath more often. I think this was in my mind though, because I can\x92t see any reason why I would have needed to breath more deeply and rapidly because I was tripping. I also lost and gained awareness of my breathing problems at different times, probably because I simply forgot about the problem and it ceased to be one because it was all in my mind. This didn\x92t help my trip at all though; it was another uncomfortable thing that helped drag me down.\r\n\r\nAs I sensed more and more that the trip was turning I tried desperately to convince myself that the trip was still enjoyable and that it would get better, and I happier, but I knew that I was kidding myself, and that I had made a big mistake in double dosing. Even though I\x92m a novice tripper I knew very early on that I had gone too far, and that I was going to be in for a bad time. I could just sense that I was going to be terribly fucked, it was a weird feeling to have. I had an underlying sense of sadness and regret, and my body was telling me that I shouldn\x92t have done this. The anxiety came back, and I started to feel quite nauseous. However the worst thing was that I began to get really depressed and hopeless about everything, and I\x92m incredibly scared of my emotions because they have hurt me so often. From here on it was like a runaway train as my mind speeded up further, my black emotions got more and more intense, and anxiety filled my body and mind. I then had a really big voluntary urge to be sick, because I wanted to stop the trip, but I realised that I wouldn\x92t be sick. I\x92m not sure why, but I think I realised I couldn\x92t even manage this task. I also realised that it wasn\x92t going to be wise to stay outside, so I stumbled back in with all my stuff, curled up on a seat, and stupidly tried to reassure my friends that I was still having a good time. \r\n\r\nI don\x92t think I would have been able to interact with my friends, but closing myself off from everything except me made the trip go into free fall. My mind was racing and for most of the time uncontrollable, and it began to get so extreme that I feared for my sanity. I could no longer think rationally, and my thoughts just went off on random tangents, often contradicting thoughts that had passed through my mind only fractions of a second ago. I fought so hard to calm down, and to reassure myself that I would come down, but it began to get so scary that I didn\x92t have much faith in myself anymore. \r\n\r\nAt this time I was curled up on a seat, my face buried in a pillow, unable to do anything, and a prisoner to my mind. I had intense closed eye visuals, although my concentration was so screwed that I would often forget they were there, and when I became aware of them they often made me feel worse, because all I desired at the time was to be sober. I felt unable to speak, and I couldn\x92t respond to my friends when they asked if I was ok. Combined with the mental problems I was an emotional wreck. I felt totally and profoundly depressed, extremely sad and regretful for what I had done, and full of pity for my suffering. I thought about death, and it seemed like such a beautiful escape. I knew I didn\x92t want to end my life, but I was having such a terrible experience that I felt I would do almost anything to stop it. I constantly thought \x91I wish I was sober\x92, and I desperately wanted to ask my friends for help, but I couldn\x92t bring myself to ask. I\x92m not sure why, but I felt it was my fault and it would be unfair to ruin their trips. I was only vaguely and occasionally aware of their presence and voices. \r\n\r\nSoon after I took refuge on the seat I became intensely aware of my body and every muscle in it. I remembered reading about this effect from \x91Shrooms and how it might be uncomfortable for some people. It was. My jaw muscles were the worst, they seemed to be constantly tense and aching, and whenever I moved my jaw to try to relax the muscles other jaw muscles would feel tense and painful. As I focused more and more on this problem it became worse, my jaw muscles really began to hurt, and I couldn\x92t get comfortable because I began to feel other muscles in my body tense up and ache. Any part of my body in contact with the seat was uncomfortable and I constantly moved about to try and relax, but it was impossible. I think that it was mostly in my mind, because at some point I just forgot about it and it didn\x92t bother me again, although while it lasted it was very uncomfortable.   \r\n\r\nAfter the metal battle had gone on for what seemed like hours I managed to bring a degree of sanity to my mind, and I felt slightly calmer because my uncontrollable internal dialogue had slowed and was more controllable. However I was still very unhappy and worried. I then looked up and started talking to my friends, explaining that I had been on one hell of a ride. Talking made me feel much better, and it took my mind off my mind, and I began to get happier and less worried. When I looked at my watch and realised that I had been curled up for about two hours I felt even better, because I realised that I was coming down and that the torture was over. Although it surprised me that it had been that long, I had become horribly aware of how slow time seemed to be passing whilst the trip was bad. At times it really did feel like I was living out a mental hell for all eternity.   \r\n\r\nI was so glad to find that within a short amount of time, and with lots talking, I was happy again, and then euphoric. All my friends were exceedingly euphoric, and it probably rubbed off on me. We spent a lot of time talking, and listening to music, sharing silly things we had noticed when tripping, and we still had a good 3-4 hours to go. I realised that I still had intense open eye visuals, and this made me really happy because it was so interesting to look at anything, especially complex colourful patterns. It was also really funny now that I was happy to not care about my confusion and random though processes. All my friends agreed about the confusion, and we had many outrageous laughing sessions when we got into even slightly complex conversations, only to loose or forget any sense of meaning about the conversation. We also found that when we got into a period of conversation which then ended you got a really strong sense of your mind slowing down, contrasted with it\x92s speedy state whilst the conversation was occurring. I also found that after the bad part of my trip I talked a lot, and was eager to explain all the things I had experienced to my friends.  \r\n\r\nThe trip was great for a long time after that. I looked at the flowery, vine like patterns on my friend\x92s sleeping bag. It was incredible, the patterns still flowed, and the vines still grew. It was alive. Everything I looked at was a wonder. Concentrating and focusing on objects often led to extreme perspective changes, especially if the object was close to my eyes. I held a mug up to my eyes and focused on the white handle. The bright lined pattern on the mug shimmered and shone, and the handle seemed to be massive, with the rest of the room receding away from me. White surfaces in the sunlight were especially interesting for imposed patterns, as I would often see bright shimmering fractal patterns on the white surfaces, which obviously were not there.\r\n\r\nI was still very happy and euphoric about five hours after eating the \x91Stones, but I began to sense reality gradually encroaching upon my mind from about six hours onwards. I gradually felt more sober, and increasingly tired and burned out. Tripping is so intense that it feels like you\x92ve been awake for two days straight. Coming down was not very enjoyable, but it wasn\x92t especially bad. I think if I had planned it better it would have been a bit easier. Sitting around not doing very much is probably not a good idea, because it makes it easier to get depressed and self-obsessed. I found talking about my experiences with my friends helped a lot, as did talking in general. Having things to do such as watching T.V., or listening to music, helped take my mind off coming down and made me less sad. However my happiness slowly left me and I got quite depressed. I was sad that my trip was over, and I missed my visuals, but emotionally my depression didn\x92t really have any basis, it was just there. Reality was coming home and it wasn\x92t a pretty sight. \r\n\r\nNot long after I began to come down we started smoking marijuana. This altered my state of consciousness again, although I didn\x92t get high. It seemed to wake me up a bit, confuse me even more, and made all my senses more sharp and crystallised. I also experienced quite a bit of paranoia and general anxiety, and although I experienced this quite a lot while tripping the marijuana definitely made it more intense. I think now, looking back, that smoking made me less relaxed and less happy, but it is hard not to smoke marijuana when you do it so often!   \r\n\r\nWe spent the evening and night smoking away, watching the news, playing computer games and listening to music. Sleeping was hard, but I did sleep on a badly padded chair, and I don\x92t sleep easily anyway.    \r\n\r\nThe next day I experienced quite a bit of depression throughout the day, and I was tired and quite restless, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. I think that because of the intensity and extraordinary nature of tripping reality seems too slow and dull for it to be an enjoyable state of consciousness for me, although this never lasts more than a day or so. I certainly feel no need to experiment with \x91Stones or \x91Shrooms for a while, and I\x92m glad that I have learned some hard lessons from the \x91Stones, rather than from some less forgiving drug.\r\n\r\nMy friends all said that they had really good trips, felt very euphoric and happy, but lacked strong visuals. Two of them had 5 grams of fresh \x91Stones, whilst the other had half a 5 gram dose. I also noticed that for the main part of the trip I drank quite a bit of water because I had such a dry mouth, although I wasn\x92t actually very thirsty, but I had to go to the toilet a ridiculous number of times for the amount of water I drank. Whilst for the latter stages of the trip, and throughout the evening, I drank lots of water and was really thirsty, but I hardly had to go to the toilet. However my friends only got thirsty in the evening, and certainly didn\x92t visit the little boys/girls room nearly as often as I did. \r\n\r\nOn my next trip I\x92m planning to take either a 5-gram dose or less, because you really don\x92t need much to have an incredible time that is still controllable. Unfortunately I\x92m not sure if I\x92m happy enough to deal with higher doses of psychedelic drugs.\r\n\r\nDespite experiencing the most distressing and mentally scary period of my life, I am now pleased that I had the whole experience. At the time I wouldn\x92t have hesitated for one moment if I could have ended my trip, and I will almost certainly never double dose again, but I am glad that I have experienced some extreme states of consciousness on my first two trips. I think that if you are not a very happy person you will always have a mixed trip, because your emotions are so fragile, changeable and intense on psilocybin/psilocin containing substances. I think the key for people who are not confident, happy and stable is to find the trip level where they can deal with the bad experiences without too much trouble, and where the good experiences are worth enduring the bad ones. I went too far this time, but I will try again, third time lucky I hope!  \r\n\r\nTake care and know your drugs."
113527,Mild Anxiety and Good Fun,Vince,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (sclerotia),"\n1st Time Shrooms - Mild Anxiety and Good Fun\r\n1.5 g wet P. Mexicana (truffles)\r\n\r\nDecided to give shrooms a try, because there\'s no way I can skip that. I purchased the shrooms at an online smartshop. The truffles came by mail this morning and my wife was absent.\r\n\r\nI wanted to try them but I have a background of anxiety I wanted to try them but I have a background of anxiety, and I\'m very sensitive in every way possible (I have very good hearing, my eyes are growing weak as I grow old but I still score a 10/10, I can smell thing before other people, but also I can ""feel"" things in other people, I cry easily, I do get high while masturbating - sorry but you get the point - and so on...). So I waited for my wife to return, told her my intentions (she already knew I purchased them) and I took half of the recommended dose for a first mild trip which is 3g divided by 2 :)\r\n\r\n12:00AM, taking the dose, chewing them very thoroughly (sry if I mispelt, not english) to a very fine mix with my saliva - as recommended - and gobbled it down with lemon+orange juice, to potentiate it a bit. On an empty stomach from the day before - didn\'t have any breakfast, as usual... haha!\r\n\r\nThe taste is cool, I liked it, don\'t know how caps taste, but the truffles tasted good to me, not earthy at all, a kind of unknown taste that immediately tickled my curiosity. It was very acid also and left a tingle in my throat.\r\n\r\nT+5min, I can definitely feel something strange happening, I\'m feeling very nervous - obviously about a possible badtrip - and for a further reading you should bear in mind that although my set and settings were good (home with my beloved one) I think my mood affected my perceptions a lot. It felt like the first onsets of alkaloids, or opiates.\r\n\r\nSo back to the report T+30, I\'m starting to feel an effect, that is a body tingle and a mild nausea, which did potentiate a bit my nervousness. I felt very light-headed, head like an helium balloon. It is also the time when my wife and I decided to eat a bit. So we ate a light meal, consisting of bread + fish-based ""tartinade"" and salad. We decided to watch a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory and we had some good laugh, all the time I was feeling drunk-like, weird and slightly nauseous and anxious at the same time. I remember describing to her the effects I felt, like things appearing brighter than they normally are. Then I had a sort of momentary dizziness when a character flipped a page and I expected the subtitles (remember I\'m not english) to sort of flip too, and it kind of happened, but nothing too serious. I remember saying to my wife : ""time perception is a bit weird, there\'s no such thing as \'at the same time\'."" By that time I was laughing more than I normally am when sober. I was enjoying the ride so far.\r\n\r\nT+1H (1PM) : the time when we stopped watching the show and my wife told me she had to go upstairs to have some work done. I think I peaked for about an hour, I just went outdoors and back again, upstairs to tell my wife how I felt (I must have been a really annoying drughead to her lol) like that time I saw the wallpaper move (a brief instant). I was also very contemplative, and enjoyed everything I did - even washing the dishes. I remember feeling very weird but still in control of my conscious me, and that was enjoyable, the nervosity/anxiety started to leave me, and I could tell I had been a bit nervous due to the ache in my neck muscles. But that didn\'t matter either.\r\n\r\nI remember drinking regularly too, which I don\'t normally do, and peeing a lot, maybe a way for my body to control and regulate the intoxication (which it truly is in my humble opinion, but a fun one). It also turned out the nausea subsided to continuous burping from that time to the time I went baseline. I have still to decide whether it was the truffles themselves or aerophagia out of anxiety. The sky, the swallows, the flowers, the clouds, everything seemed more beautiful than ever in my life.\r\n\r\n(2PM )T+2H, at that time I think I plateau-ed for about an hour. I was getting used to the trip, but didn\'t feel it could get worse so I decided to pack a small bowl of marijuana and light it up. I went boom for about 2 minutes, nothing crazy but it made me rebound on the high I was riding 1 hour before (good to know), very impaired, but lots of laughing.\r\n\r\nThen I social-mediatized a bit, nothing fancy, I watched a few video, and suddenly realized I hadn\'t listened to music. I chose to listen to some potent stuff such as End Trance By ZEE (Zebbler Encanti Experiment), and the drops hit me like crazy, but overall I found the songs of the EP to be too short to lead me anywhere and I told my wife : ""now I understand why The Pink Floyds or Iron Butterfly were making such long tracks"". I also had weird ideas about my cat (don\'t remember if it was before or after) where I told my wife ""we gotta talk to her more, I think she\'s intelligent and understands more than we think"" and she made me understand that she was not sure I would stick to that idea while coming down (I do think it is permanently true now and I\'ll talk to her more). Then I took another pee and challenged myself to synthesize a sound I heard in the music I listened too before, it turned out I understood the basics of the sound so I went creative about what I was doing - for the nerds out there in the back haha I had fun with both FM synthesis and filter FM. Saved my synth patches like a sober person, I even made an effect chain to post process the sound later that I did save, but the naming of the patch was a lil weird lmao. From that time on, I had those surges of strange ideas that are very frequent when I smoke marijuana, so I guess I was going back to baseline.\r\n\r\nT+3H (3PM) for about an hour the sensations of being drunk-like and weird at the same time persisted but got weaker. II was basically just watching chemical reactions videos on youtube (because I plan to buy some chemicals and have fun with my daughter, you know making soda+sugar black serpent, that sort of things) instagraming a bit, checking emails. Nothing to be noted.\r\n\r\nT+4H (4PM) I was a lil sore and excited at the same time, I ate a bit and drank another of my numerous glasses of water before my wife and I decided to go to a nearby strawberry field to pick up a kg of strawberries, we also bought some fresh vegetables that the guy grows, and went back to our house, where i am typing this report after a bit of cleaning the house. I was not impaired at all to drive so I guess I was back to baseline, tho I can draw a line between how I felt and baseline anymore (which I find very funny).\r\n\r\nI feel very good about that experience, I was expecting some anxiety - I\'m old enough to know myself - and I\'m pretty sure my mood really did have an effect on this light trip. I\'m pretty sure my mood really did have an effect on this light trip.\r\n\r\nThe body buzz / tingling, light-headedness and drunk-like sensations were very enjoyable, much like marijuana, but with a weird twist to it. So all in all, I enjoyed the substance, and that enjoyment I felt makes me very happy. Tomorrow I plan on increasing the dose a bit (maybe 2g) and also share them with a friend because I ain\'t gonna gobble down the quantity that was sent to me in the time they say you can keep them in the fridge, and I fear they might be lost.\r\n\r\nHope this report serves a purpose.\r\n\r\nWith love."
112716,"Life and Death, a Constant Struggle",someone,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nSetting and background:\r\n\r\nI had done psilocybine mushshrooms before, roughly two years ago. I\x92d eaten 2.5 grams then. This experience was something like half of what I got this time, the amount was also half of what I ate this time.\r\n\r\nMy setting was just me in my room, with my headphones. I had contacted some friends but a little too late. I had some heroic ideas of going in completely alone. I hadn\x92t eaten anything, but the shrooms had been sitting in honey for a couple of weeks so there was some energy to get me through this.\r\n\r\nDuring my research, I had often come across that intention is important for a psychedelic trip. I suppose what this means is that you need to have set a search area in your mind, so that the relevant thoughts in your unconscious appear to you in your trip. My intention was not very clear to me, I had written some things down that vaguely tried to approach my intention, but if I am to warrant a guess with the prior and posterior information, I was trying to gain knowledge of myself, my fears. Particularly the fear of the unknown and ultimately death, which I think it contains. To create again and to beat death is a process that I am not familiar with so I am instead lost in a state of timid detachment.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I had done mushrooms before, and that was a \x93glowing\x94 experience. I felt connected with all beings around me and their struggle for survival. I remember being very fascinated with birds and how they navigated the landscape that we humans define, completely oblivious of our existence as anything more than a mysterious obstacle in their constant struggle to find food. The warmth of the earth, the sun and the grass was like a gentle reassurance that there is good in this world. I was with a friend and a friend of his. I am generally a very reserved person so awkwardness and hidden fears surfaced in me but only briefly and overall I would say this was a bonding experience with both of them, and after it I felt a certain sense of camaraderie having been through something like that with others. \r\n\r\nThis time\r\n\r\nI have been growing more and more detached from myself and others. Prior to this, I had spent a number of months of my life being constantly around other people during my mandatory military service. Prior to this, I had spent a number of months of my life being constantly around other people during my mandatory military service. This was a strange experience for many reasons. Being around others and not having a slight care filled me with a simple virility that I hadn\x92t been used to before. After it I came back into my old life, there was a gradual isolation and slipping into a detached state of being. I could hardly remember what being in awe felt like and started being afraid that those blissful images I had acquired in the past were beginning to fade away or that I had ever felt them to begin with. In the meantime I had been reading Jung and other Jungian inspired works (Although, reading Jung I realized that I had been already reading Jung through authors inspired by him already for a long time), and I decided explore the unconscious to try to understand what it is that is keeping me from finding something real to express.\r\n\r\n12:00 pm\r\nSo I took 5 grams of dried shrooms in front of me and stared at them for about half an hour. I was filled with fear, the fear of the unknown. I had notes on paper and on my computer screen reassuring my future self of the temporariness of my about to be state, notes that were simply funny to me later on and meaningless. If anything, these notes were an early surfacing of my fears, fears that one tries to face and navigate through when on the trip, so let\x92s say an early micrography of the trip itself.\r\n\r\n12:20 pm\r\nI mustered the courage and beat my rationality and quickly ate most of the mushrooms. There was a single big stalk that I left and stared at for a good few seconds. I remember thinking that this could be my way back, if I didn\x92t eat this, I would escape the threshold. But once again I acted the fool.\r\n\r\n12:35~ish\r\nSoon after that I started panicking once again, there was now no way back. I messaged a couple of friends and my brother. I found no response anywhere, so I accepted my \x93fate\x94. My hands started growing numb because of the panic and I wasn\x92t sure how to tackle the come up. I spent some time doing a last minute study into some texts, kinda like what one would do before an exam one has gone uprepared to.\r\n\r\n12:50\r\nThe effect started becoming noticeable, my head started \x93slowing\x94 down and feeling heavier. I knew that in the next 20 mins or so I would be \x93launched\x94 into the unknown. I was listening to some Vangelis music the past few days, so I hastily started a spotify playlist based on \x93Chariots of fire\x94, this all becomes very poetic if you choose to look at it that way. The chariots of fire is a concept linked with Apollo and the sun god Abraxas, so this is how the trip towards what I thought would be the sun began. I glanced through the tracks in the queue, I recognised some of them but not all.\r\n\r\n13:10 \r\nNow it had really began, I started feeling very cold so I went and covered myself with the duvet and sat in the bed. Eyes started popping out in my duvet cover and the power sockets. I started being detached from my body, my limbs felt as if I was touching someone else. I let my head fall into the duvet which was covering my knees, and the travel distance  from the duvet surface to my knees felt as if I was moving my head around in an huge soft space. I opened my eyes and looked at the power socket, it was glistening wildly and was like a sly eye peering at me. I cracked what seemed like a devilish smile in this moment and this caused me to be afraid, I immediately closed my eyes and covered my nose with \x93prayer hands\x94 so as to control my breathing and still my thoughts. This is the last time I had my eyes open for the next 2 hours roughly. I lied down in my bed and covered myself. My headphones still on, I delved deeper into nothingness. It felt as if I was completely inside my brain. Surfing on geometrical shapes of beauty and trying not to lose my balance and delve into terror. There were moments when terrors appeared to me but I managed to still the thoughts. I remember having my hand on my ribcage, it felt as foreign but the heart rate was an indication, as if I was commandeering a ship. The terrors looked like formless goo, they made underworldly sounds. Sometimes the music would terrorize me, but I thought that I would endure it and not look away.\r\n\r\n15:30 or so\r\nI am not sure how long the past paragraph took out of the roughly two hours I spent on the bed, it could all be an instant or eternity.  I cannot place the memories in a proper timeline. At some point at 15 30, I got up from the bed and dashed towards my computer. It was a synchronous event, as a friend had messaged me at that moment or slightly before. I emerged from this nothingness terrified at the absolute pain of loneliness and fluid inexistence. I had to establish a connection, words did not come easily and what I had to communicate was difficult to express, but at that moment I felt like I had succeeded and that the connection had been formed at that moment I felt like I had succeeded and that the connection had been formed. I was once again \x93alive\x94 and connected. I spend the next hour weeping on the floor and in between sending some messages to friends. I had felt this immense pain and was thankful to be once again under the light, I had feelings of equally immense gratitude. Coincidentally, the sounds playing in my headphones were in tune with the moment, and were songs inspiring unity.\r\n\r\n16:20~\r\nMy sense of self was starting to come back, there was a homunculus again in charge that tried to actively integrate and consolidate knowledge. My fear took the form of me losing my acquired bliss once again. I felt the desperation to put the experience in focus and analyze it, but my mind was very difficult to focus. Things appeared blurry as well. At this moment I was on an information plane of existence, where I was communicating and existing in metaphors At this moment I was on an information plane of existence, where I was communicating and existing in metaphors, metaphors that were created by me and a friend I was communicating with. It was as if this plane of metaphors was a collective unconscious transmitted through language. I took off my headphones because music was standing in the way of the \x93information processor\x94 that was trying to focus.\r\n\r\n17:00\r\nAround this time I was regaining clarity, but was still confused and hazy I felt like my feet were on the ground and a metaphor came to my mind of the pentagrams. The feet on the ground and the head towards the stars. I was thankful to have come  back into existence and I understood the opposite as death. The powers of death and life are constantly at work within us and in the world. It\x92s hard to say which of your actions are your own and come from love, and which stem from a force of fear of death. \r\n\r\n18:00 \r\nI was mostly back, weeping at pictures and songs describing destruction, pain and isolation. I had never felt isolation to that extent and those images still 1 day later evoke a very emotional response.\r\n\r\n17:00. \r\nI got up and encountered my kitchen in absolute disarray, once again I felt the powers of abandonment and isolation staring at me. I visualized people who haven\x92t give up and projected the forces of love on them. Images of my mother came to my mind and her unwavering drive of fighting entropy and death. I also remembered an image from a Jodorowsky film, where a carpenter who is making a lot of chairs for free responds to Jodorowsky\'s father that all paths lead to god, when the character portraying his father looks at him confused at this drive.\r\n\r\nI felt hungry and went to the super market, this time with no headphones on as I usually do to shut the world out.\r\n\r\nI think this experience was a glimpse of spiritual pain and nothingness. And one cannot really see pain and struggle until one has felt it, and just what it takes out of some people to power through it. \r\n\r\nI am writing this a day after, and the images are very vivid still in my mind. Part of me is afraid that I will once again timidly drift into isolation and nothingness, but that is I suppose what the \x93trip\x94 of life, which only appears to us exacerbated so that one cannot ignore it."
110209,Spiritual Awakening,Don Sombra,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nSpiritual Awakening Provoked by Ps. Mexicana\r\n\r\nA few days ago I had a very profound experience with Psilocybe Mexicana, which I will now relay to you. I managed to capture a lot of the key revelations in my notebook which I will share, but surely despite my efforts I will not be able to fully elaborate on the gravity of the experience. \r\n\r\nThe most astonishing part of this trip was that for the very first time, I encountered what was undeniably an intellect other than that which I call my own. I\'m familiar with Jung\'s concept of the \'Other\', a description aptly befitting of the presence I felt. Despite normally being very skeptical about the things I observe \'in there\', this time was very different from all of the rest, there is no way I can deny the presence of this \'something\' that came to me, or, perhaps more accurately, I became IT. It was a very big something, so big that there are no dimensions I could attribute to it that might effectively contain it. I\'ve had some pretty deep treks into subconscious realms, but so far the focus has been primarily on the content of my life; I have much enjoyed the gift of deep reflection on my thoughts, behaviors, and relationships within the context of casual evening dabbling in psychology (I have no formal education in psychology, only a keen interest). I was raised in the Protestant Christian tradition and have always had the concept of spirituality in my life, but until very recently I had never encountered any presence resembling God or the Other. As a child I prayed daily, but never felt that my prayers were being answered in any tangible way. \r\n\r\nI\'ve felt the vague sensation of a presence, or a force, or maybe even an imaginary friend, but my recent encounter surpassed all definition. I\'ve felt the vague sensation of a presence, or a force, or maybe even an imaginary friend, but my recent encounter surpassed all definition. It was THE thing, EVERY thing, it was IT! The only thing there is and perhaps ever will be. It drained my entire existence out of me. I was sucked through a churning vortex of memories, a multiplex of every experience I have ever had; all of the loves, friendships, embarrassments, joys, sufferings and everything mundane in between, all smashed together in a spiraling cascade of supreme beauty. At last I popped out the other side turned completely inside-out, a vacuum-tube of pure awareness. In this \'place\', there was nothing familiar. It was as though I was behind being. I could conceptualize existence, or \'being\', but only in the sense that \'being\' itself was an object I could hold in my hand and playfully toss about like a marble. This felt much more like birth than death.\r\n\r\nI had been feeling a stronger-than-usual urge to visit the mushroom in the week leading up to the foray. I think that it was trying to visit me in my dreams, because on three occasions I awoke in the whirlwind psilocybin state without having gone through the formality of inviting it in. As I would discover later, it was trying to get my attention. I was recovering from a minor illness, and therefor I opted to cut my usual dose in half. My usual dose of Ps. Cyanescens or Ps. Mexicana is 1g, but this time I consumed only 0.5g in a tea mixed with hibiscus flowers, ginger, lemon juice and honey. I also ate a large piece of quality chocolate, which has become an essential part of my ritual. I usually prepare myself by taking a short run or stroll around the neighborhood, sometimes stopping at a favorite bench to close my eyes and allow my anxieties and tensions to run their course. The only modification I made to my ritual this time was to light a beeswax candle before consuming the tea. I enjoyed the beautiful simplicity of this addition, and I know that I will continue to incorporate this into my practice in the future.\r\n\r\nIt began as it always does. First, blackness, hands on my chest heaving up, down, up, down, heart-rate exaggerated. A lump of fear begins to form inside of my throat, fear at the sudden recognition of the spell I have just willfully cast upon my future, something like a stick of dynamite waiting to wreak havoc at any moment. I am gripped by a desire to abandon the mission, to evacuate this \'chemical\' from my body, but it\'s too late. With steady breathing fear subsides and soon after come the first symptoms; minuscule splashes of brilliant pastel colors on the eyelids, coupled with the sensation of being subjected to an IV-drip of bee-venom. Then the vibrations begin, those fluttering pulsations like a large insect periodically beating its wings inside of my forehead. Soon the insects become audible too, they are busy at work building their nest deep inside of my body. Breathing is very important at this stage, as panic is often only a few thumping heartbeats away from me. From this point on, language can not suffice. I\'ll do my best, but you\'ll have to humor me.\r\n\r\nSome images that I have come to associate with the Mexicanas include ziggurat-like structures, pyramids, and fluorescent grid-like matrices resembling blueprints of futuristic cities with highly advanced infrastructure. The complexity is truly astonishing. My mouth remains agape for the majority of the experience, as I can only observe in awesome reverence; if it were not happening to me I would never believe it possible. Ornate stained glass and mosaic motifs are common themes. I am an artist, the medium I work with most often is ceramic tile mosaic, so I think that I have a natural propensity to generate puzzle-like images of fractured organization. This sort of imagery continued for some time, until life-like figures began to emerge, figures in the form of humanoids with pyramids for heads.\r\n\r\nIn the city I call home, there is a place called the Centennial Square in the heart of the downtown core. In the middle of the square is a very large fountain with three majestic totem-like monoliths with golden mosaics encrusted on their surfaces. The piece was created by an eccentric and mysterious artist called Jack W., about whom I can source very little information. Sadly he passed away only a few years ago. This fountain is by far my favorite piece of public art, perhaps my favorite piece of art period. Recently, due to years of grumbling from the small-minded public the city has discussed removing it in favor of a children\'s aquatic park, which would be rather bittersweet. I have spent many hours in solemn admiration of its beauty. The figures depicted in the panels are the very same as the figures that came to me via the Mexicanas. Based on my research, the images in the mosaics are inspired by Soren Kierkegaard\'s theory of the three stages of life. If this is true, it is a pretty stunning synchronicity that these figures were conjured during what may well have been my own personal metamorphosis. Further numinous synchronicity associated with this artwork will be touched upon later in this report.\r\n\r\nThe imagery of these small pyramid-headed figures continued for some time until the scene condensed into something very much more life-like. I had the feeling that I was poking my head out from a hole in the ground, and above me was a kind of open livestock shelter or a barn without walls. It was bustling with donkeys and people dressed in pure white cotton and woven ponchos. Everyone was speaking jovially in a language that sounded like Spanish, and at the time I felt that I could understand perfectly what they were saying, but I cannot for the life of me remember now. It was as if I had unwittingly stumbled upon a fragment of time and space, everyone was going about their business completely unaware of my presence. I felt like I had transported to a very real place in time. This continued for who knows how long, until the mood became very solemn, and I opened my eyes to return to my bedroom. This is the point where the encounter with the Other, or the \'It\' began, and I began to furiously dictate in my notebook. I will simply copy what \'I\' wrote, verbatim.\r\n\r\n\'Life as you know it is a kind of meeting of the spirits. There is no need to know why this is happening. Abandon the desire to know. If you can do this you will understand how to truly learn. In order for any idea to be \'languaged\' it must first be forced into existence. This is your task. You are charged with the task of bringing ideas into what you refer to as language. If you can watch for the signs of my presence and trust in me I will help you. I am \'It\'. There is no way for you in your current state of evolution to understand me in more finite terms. All that can be said is that \'I am It\'.\'\r\n\r\n \'This is how you are to acknowledge other people: \'I acknowledge that you, like me, are a singularity, the culmination of infinite energies gathered into a single point.\'\'\r\n\r\n\'Who are you? The only logical answer to this question is \'I don\'t know\', because you don\'t know anything. If you want to meet your destiny (you don\'t have a choice) you will look for the symbols of my presence. You have heard these referred to as \'archetypes\'. This is my language, or the way I make myself known. I can only teach you in such a way that you do not reveal my presence in disrespectful manner, or in a manner which may cause excessive alarm.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why do you think you want to know what you want to know? Do you understand what motivates your curiosity? It is Me. If you watch for me I will answer your questions to the best of your ability to comprehend. Continue to periodically eat mushrooms.\'\r\n\r\nFinally, the phrase \'Do not fear, your sanity has been vouchsafed\' was repeated several times \'Do not fear, your sanity has been vouchsafed\' was repeated several times and has become something of a mantra to me in the days following the experience.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, this was by far the most profound moment of my life. I feel very light, as though an incredible burden has been lifted from me. Everything I see in the world around me is imbued with meaning. Despite these sudden and profound changes, I feel calm, serene and gentle. I do not feel an outpouring of manic energy, or the desire to proclaim my discoveries from the rooftops. I feel blessed, purposeful and full of empathic energy. It is as though the course of my life has been determined, and all that is left to do is dutifully follow the beckoning call of this guiding voice.\r\n\r\nThe last thing that happened before I was \'released\' so to speak, is that I was given a short list of people to reach out to, a rather diverse bunch a might add. Since reaching out to each of these individuals, their role in my narrative crystallized almost immediately. One of the people I was instructed to reach out to is an old friend of mine who I had lost touch with in recent years. He used to regularly participate in traditional Peruvian ayahuasca ceremonies in various places around the world. He was very secretive about this activity until I contacted him and relayed my story about the Mexicana trip, and as a result he entrusted me with the whole story of his coming to be a part of that community. He was in a relationship an apprentice shaman for three years, and thus was invited to sit by her side at over 100 ceremonies. He also put me in touch with the organizer of that community, and now I\'ve been invited to attend an ayahuasca ceremony for the first time. The second astonishing connection I made through the same friend is so far beyond what I could have anticipated, even considering the bizarre trail that lead me there in the first place. I told him about my visions and the mosaic with the pyramid-people, and being pretty savvy about local art (and a skilled artist of some renown himself) he immediately chimed in that his next-door neighbor is none other than the widow of  the man who built the mosaic monoliths. He literally shares a wall with the widow of the man who inspired the entities I saw in my vision. I\'m going to try to arrange a meeting with her to see where this cryptic rabbit hole takes me next. \r\n\r\nIf this stuff wasn\'t happening to me I would never believe it. I am now convinced beyond a doubt that there is much more to life than I could have ever previously imagined, even with hundreds of psychedelic voyages under my belt (many of which were potentiated by much higher doses of other psilocybin mushroom species). There are no borders between what we call spirit and matter. Inside is outside, and nature is an organized entelechy that expresses itself in manifold and mysterious ways, perhaps most prominently in the words and deeds of all peoples of the earth. As I seek out the symbols of the presence of this Other that made itself known to me, I may periodically post updates about my quest in case anyone is interested. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I state that I have reason to believe that even at doses as low as 0.5g, the Psilocybe Mexicana mushroom can potentiate very profound spiritual experience in the consumer, and this belief is strongly reinforced by the traditional and ceremonial use of this particular species by the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, Mexico."
109094,High Dose From an IT Guy\'s Perspective,Andy Menzija,LSD & Mushrooms - P. mexicana (Truffle),"\nI am a 29-year-old university teaching assistant (IT) and have medium experience with magic mushrooms, salvia divinorum, spacecakes, smoking weed, and acid. I never did drugs before I started my PhD and gained access to scientific article databases with credible sources of information. I would describe myself as a calm/self-controlled person more introverted than extroverted and prefer taking drugs alone because social activities and norms become difficult for me when on them.\r\n\r\nJust for the measure, 1 drop of LSD I had was enough for a nice trip. I had taken 1, 3, and 5 drops from the same source prior to this experience. Several friends of mine were also satisfied with the 1-drop trip. I would never do a dose this high from a source of unknown potency.\r\n\r\nT: I took 7 drops LSD and 8 grams not really cracker dry truffles mexicana.\r\n\r\nT+30m: Letters on the computer screen started moving, surfaces started breathing, and my attention was for 5-10 minutes shifted to the shapes of the surface of my wooden desk that started morphing and bleeding in brown and black colors. I felt that the effects would still get stronger, but not unhandlable, and I felt the urge to go deeper down the rabbit hole, as if I was close to the source of the eternal wisdom or source of self and wanted to reach it. But this urge was more like a drunken feeling of \'let\'s do this\' without considering potential consequences of the act. I took another two drops, although I felt like I could suck up the whole bottle of acid I had. I returned to the room and started eating some snacks. The music was so intense it was designing the fabric my trip was made of. At some point I changed from Asian dub foundation to Sigur ros. The video of Sigur ros (user-made video) made me nervous as it was designed as a transparent collage of three images: sunset, seascape, and fireworks. It looked so tasteless I was convinced it was a trick of my mind, especially the fireworks part, but couldn\'t really check. The continent shapes on my scratch-off silver world map on my wall was melting and dancing every time I looked at it. The dark blue fantasy pyramid picture on my wall was changing colors in a beautiful way as well. Self-designed visual beauty. But nothing you can\'t do with digital technology anyway. White edges I would look at would soon start turning black as when the paper catches fire. I really enjoyed this. If I were an artist, I would probably do this more often for some inspiration.\r\n\r\nT+90m: The effects started getting stronger now. Very nice visuals wherever I would look: Shiva, Aztec motives, light colors splashing, spectral leaking, reflecting and mirroring everywhere. I was amazed by this beauty and playfulness of my mind. I would disappear into ~10min thinking sessions and then re-emerge to reality and make a few steps around the apartment. I would disappear into ~10min thinking sessions and then re-emerge to reality and make a few steps around the apartment. I was aware that I was not fully aware of my surroundings and that I would be safer with a sitter, especially if the dose was any higher. I could make sense of the reality, but my mind would wonder off and leave the body unattended to its autopilots and reflexes or just lying on the bed. I had my thoughts and fantasies take me away with motives including Brazil and Middle East, I would wander through thought recursions measurable in non-measurable concepts and non-concepts impossible to describe in words. At least on two occasions it seemed to me I had a parallel life right now somewhere in the Middle East, or a previous life there. \r\n\r\nIt was also now that I got lost in my thoughts and experienced an ego death of some kind. I wasn\'t aware of my body any more and somehow the whole of myself was reduced to an abstract concept and processes. As if I was a baby. All my brain drivers got turned off and I had no language to think in, no verbs, no actions, no mental processing capacity, just my consciousness as a blank method, a constructor to be written on the class of Me. If you are a programmer, you\'ll know what I mean. I soon got back from this thought and regained awareness of my body and started thinking about the experience. It seemed to me now that ego death, once it occurs, is not that bad at all, and that it was actually only a side process of lesser importance in that what I had experienced. \r\n\r\nI realized I had no idea of what I was getting into as I took acid and that what just happened in my mind was of great importance. But for whom? For my physical self? For my reduced self? For what was left after the ego death? Uncertain of what I was supposed to be, i.e. who should be learning from this experience, this question was bothering me for a while. Was this who I really was or was this my reduced self doing too much drugs? Was this a breakthrough from the real world to the imaginary world of drug-induced hallucinations or exactly the opposite? I laughed out loud more than several times realizing how strange it was that someone in the universe is going through this right now, or more precisely, that the universe itself was going through this right now. For a while I was thinking about my girlfriend, and our relationship. About the fact that I will die and how pointless the physical life is, when things that seem equally real can happen in a second in this drug-induced state. I felt as I had lived the entire life of another person from the Middle East (no idea why exactly there) in less than a second. What a terrible waste of time, matter and energy this life is. Why would this really be happening? Unless this \'real life\' is not really happening and it\'s all just a dream and a hallucination.\r\n\r\nT+180m: The effects were getting weaker now, and I was spending less and less time in thinking sessions. It wasn\'t over, however. I still experienced weird moments when I realized I don\'t have language and my mental processing was that of a child. I had my mind insert random forgotten memories and details forming them into thought recursions and distractors. Soon after that I had a feeling that I was just re-activating some mental processes I learned as a child: the process of processing reality. Of analyzing visual stimuli in time and responding with a reaction. I remembered not having words for these as a child, but that I was learning them and started using them. They didn\'t have names as I didn\'t know words at that time, but they were \'something\' and I understood that. If I were a computer, my experience was as if I had my hardware drivers for certain brain regions uninstalled, and then compiled from source and installed again after a while. In reality I guess this means my brain regions got desynchronized and stopped working together for a while causing this temporary loss of reality-processing abilities. This process wasn\'t unpleasant, it just was there. At the time I didn\'t really realize that this was probably my earliest memories as a baby, but in retrospective I believe that they were. If not memories, than the same things I experienced as a baby - not knowing how to process sensory input and not knowing how to PROCESS and that I SHOULD PROCESS reality. ANd then slowly learning how to do it.\r\n\r\nT+300m: I went to the balcony and changing my environment landed me back to the ground more or less. I enjoyed a glass of whiskey watching down on the street from the 3rd floor. The visual distortions were still present and remained all until I went to sleep after midnight, but didn\'t bother me too much any more.\r\n\r\nT+420m: Almost back to normal. Slower and clumsier than usually, but performing my daily chores and waiting for my girlfriend.\r\n\r\nWent to sleep after midnight. You might think that 6 hours is a short time for a trip on that much acid and shrooms, but I usually have effects wear off faster than online resources would claim. I usually have effects wear off faster than online resources would claim.\r\n\r\nNext day very tired (but also had to wake up relatively early). One day later still distracted and tired, and a bit depressed after I returned to the world not shining in bright changing colors and crazy creative thoughts all the time. No wonder I guess, my dopamine receptors were overloaded during the trip.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, a positive experience with positive insights, childhood memories revived, impossible abstract thoughts. But LSD remains what I already thought it is; a chemical agent to introduce me to unusual brain states by desyncing brain regions and firing neurons and memories that don\'t get fired in everyday brain usage."
110217,"Discovery, Healing, and Transformation",Elf,Mushrooms - P. cubensis & P. mexicana,"\nMy Shroomy Story\r\n\r\nI have conducted my own research with psilocybin now for the past 40 years. I have worked both individually, with family/friends (including my parents and children), and, for a year, intensively with a small group of fellow graduate students. <!--The Mazatecans have been doing this kind of work for at least hundreds of years, if not millennia. We already know a great deal about it\'s health benefits.-->\r\n\r\nI started working with the mushroom in the early 1970s, when I took a college level mycology course and discovered that active forms of Panaeolus subbalteatus grew locally. It wasn\'t until 1976 though, with the publication of the McKenna brothers\' little cultivation book that a steady supply of Psilocybe cubensis was available to us. At that time I was a lab tech, so aseptic/sterile technique was very familiar and growing was quite easy. I also bought a Samadhi isolation tank from John Lilly and was plying the depths of the psilocybin trance in a floatation tank long before the movie \'Altered States\' came out. \r\n\r\nOnce I started taking psilocybin, it began laying out a program for my development quite clearly and insistently. I was directed to read the entire collected works of C. G. Jung and slowly bought them through the Bollingen Foundation (then only $20 a volume for hardcover editions!). I was basically a back-to-nature 70s hippie freak when I started this process, growing an organic garden, canning tomatoes, and smoking about 1-2 oz. a week of top quality organically grown bud (grown outdoors; Colombian/Mexican sativa strains then). \r\n\r\nThe first thing the mushroom made clear was that for the deeper visions to be vouchsafed to me, I had to set aside the cannabis. The first thing the mushroom made clear was that for the deeper visions to be vouchsafed to me, I had to set aside the cannabis. I did so, and then perception of the soul dimension, the imaginative functions, awoke in earnest. At that point, it became clear to me that I had to return to college and pursue a degree in clinical psychology, which I dutifully undertook. I graduated from my undergrad program summa cum laude and went on to graduate school the next fall. All this, by the way, was fueled by the two strains of P. cubensis <!--then distributed by the McKenna brothers,--> \'Amazonian\' and \'Brillo Nuevo\'<!--available from Terence\'s and Kat\'s company, Lux Natura-->. Life continued to get more interesting, as my daughter was born just before I finished my undergraduate career and entered graduate school.\r\n\r\nOnce in graduate school, I began to work with a small group of fellow grad students who shared my interest. In the year 1985, I conducted 5g sessions every Friday night for 52 consecutive weeks. What unfolded during that year was astounding. At the end of the year, I took a course in clinical hypnosis with a professor I hadn\'t seen in a couple of years. He took one look at me and said, \'I don\'t know what it is you\'re doing, but, whatever it is, keep it up! My God! What a transformation!\' It was with his assistance that I obtained an APA approved internship at a high end urban Children\'s Hospital. My career has since consumed more of my time, and I have had less time for work with the mushroom, but even at the age of 60 years, I continue to occasionally consult with my spiritual teacher, \'Los Santos Ninos.\' They help me see more deeply into the state of my clients\' souls and, I have found, allow consciousness to access their inner worlds so as to better understand their suffering and facilitate their unique healing process.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, we have been putting our attention on the species with a history of traditional usage among the Mazatecan people, primarily Psilocybe mexicana. This species has a spectrum of effects far different from the cubensis. I find them more conducive to a calm serenity, which allows a much deeper exploration of the soul dimension of the mushroom. Deeper dimensions of awareness are opening that are far more subtle and profound than anything I had ever even considered as being possible. With the presence of the mushroom, I am finding an awareness emerging that is drawn into work with my clients at depths beyond egoic awareness, but which their souls respond to, and brings forth deep self-acceptance and healing. Perception expands to depths and heights of awareness that extend far beyond what one might even think of as possible. None of this is in any way ego-based, it is a level of action beyond the individual and better described as the activity of the soul. My clients know nothing of this, it is born of my work on myself, and the presence of the spirit of the mushroom simply does its natural work. \r\n\r\nThe mushroom continues to be a source of discovery, healing, and transformation, even more so, than when I first began working with it. Working consistently and persistently with the mushroom over the past 40 years, I have gone from beginner to intermediate to advanced levels, and am amazed that it continues to be a source of inexhaustible teachings. Such a gift to humanity. \r\n\r\n<!--All of this lies far beyond what the academic researchers are even aware of as a possibility. Working from the level of intellect alone, they remain stuck in the scientific medical model and think that this is something that they can \'prescribe\' and \'control.\' The mystery is far grander and far more powerful than they can even begin to imagine, and it is freely available to all of us! It is, in my humble opinion, our natural birth right. It is beyond what authoritarian governmental types can manage. They intuitively know this and they\'re afraid of it. They\'ve only dipped their little toe into the water. I think that they would be better served stopping their experimentation on \'patients\' and just eating it themselves. Tim Leary and Richard Alpert saw it all very clearly over 50 years ago, which is why they were persecuted. Things have really not changed a whole lot since...-->"
106262,A Stupor That I Was Desperate to Escape,Mortron,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nMagic Mushroom Overdose\r\n\r\nI have been taking magic mushrooms about 4 times a year for the past 4 years.  Always with a group of like-minded companions - usually in groups of three.  I consider myself experienced, fearless but also cautious.\r\n\r\nUp until this point my experiences had been exceptional - but I was convinced there were deeper experiences available which are harder to reach and behold in social environments, which tend to be too animated.\r\n\r\nI was on my own in my parents\' house, with a free house for the next 4 days.  I blended 40g of fresh psilocybe mexicana magic truffles with water into a smoothy, and I drank it at about 10pm on an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nAfter about half an hour I wasn\'t having any effects.  I sat outside and smoked a joint in the garden.  When I returned to the house my visuals had begun, and I sat up, closed my eyes and observed.  I was determined to let go of my body, completely submit to the magic mushrooms and let them act out their nature in my body and mind - without the distraction of music or friends.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was struggling to get comfortable, the visuals were extraordinary - the scale and complexity I was convinced I had never experienced before.  Organised networks of multi-coloured machine snakes, conveyor belts belching out animatronic forms - it was like a prolonged DMT trip.  I had found what I was looking for.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I surrendered completely - my body began behaving strangely.  I was swaying back and forth, hands and arms twitching - and I began yawning aggressively.  Each yawn was spewing out more intense visuals, and it seemed as though the mushrooms were animating my body to create different forms.  I assumed there was a symbiosis and I was becoming one with the mushrooms.  I was happy for them to lead.  I even had the sensation that they were touching my face - and using my body (especially my mouth) to exhibit various bizarre visual motifs.\r\n\r\nHowever I was now uncomfortable that my body was being possessed by an external agent, which seemed determined to shake my hands, and stretch my jaw open.  If anyone could see me in these moments it would be cause for serious alarm.\r\n\r\nI was curious to play the scenario out, but became afraid that this was a physiological reaction to a poison and I started to try and take control of myself. I walked outside into the garden to calm myself down - but each time I lost concentration, my mouth would start to yawn open, bearing teeth in a bizarre ritualistic fashion.  I was no longer willing to surrender - my priorities were to protect myself and avoid disaster.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t let the trip pass, because it took my full concentration to take my body under my control and keep still.  However, I now started losing my mind.  I was delirious, disorientated, and had no sense of self.   I was determined to stay alive - but knew I had about 3 hours of intense work ahead of me.  If I closed my eyes the visuals were still extraordinary, but I didn\'t have the calm or presence of mind to appreciate them.  They were merely there to remind me of what the night could have been.\r\n\r\nI had never understood the notion of a \'bad trip\' because I had always been in control over my experience and mood - but seeking deeper levels of experience had sent me into a stupor that I was desperate to escape. seeking deeper levels of experience had sent me into a stupor that I was desperate to escape.  My priorities remained to stay alive and safe and not drift into the trans-dimensional space which threatened to consume me.  \r\n\r\nI was willing myself to break free and save my evening, but I was helpless and had lost all sense of autonomy over my senses. I looked it the mirror and observed what happened to my features if I relaxed and this confirmed my fears that the agent animating my body was not of like mind and I must fight my way through this ordeal.\r\n\r\nHours passed, and as I realised I was retrieving some shreds of my personality back - I was immensely grateful that it was likely I would recover.\r\n\r\nWhat was meant to be a career-defining trip for me only served as a stark reminder of the limitations of our body and how little we understand of these substances in their extreme form. \r\n\r\nMy search for the perfect combination of depth of experience, presence of mind and calmness continues.  The dose required to induce intense visuals whilst maintaining the requisite attention is about 30g for me.\r\n\r\nThe spaces and forms encountered on mushrooms are not benevolent, serene or spiritual - they are complex and alien and must be approached with caution and not blind submission - but they\'re still completely enchanting."
70721,The Revelation,Oneiromancer,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI used 30 gram of the shrooms at 23:00, and another 30 gram about an hour later -- I used them alone. It took a long time before they worked, but when they did the experience was intense until about 6:00. No hallucinations, but an astonishing expansion of consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe first effect I noticed was a feeling of vagueness. I was distracted by everything, and couldn\'t concentrate well on the report I was trying to write in the beginning to record my experiences. After a while, I started to draw with color pencils, and soon became so fascinated by the colors that I couldn\'t take my eyes of them. I started to feel slight nausea from the shrooms, so I took some motilium. Later, the malaise turnt into a warm feeling in my stomach, which spread across my heart and belly and soon my entire body. I felt an overwhelming warmth inside me which was very comfortable. I came to feel happier then I ever had before, and I found I could amplify this feeling at will as I muttered \'thank you.\'\r\n\r\nMy body became extremely sensitive - it was as if I was experiencing the boundaries of my body for the first time. Aside from the incredibly warm feeling in my torso, my face and hands became particularly sensitive. Everything around me seemed far more defined visually, though this is an effect I can remember the least. I really enjoyed the astronomical pictures I had in my iPhoto library. The colors were wonderful, and I started to become aware of how the stars were moving slightly. I chatted with a friend who\'d used shrooms earlier for a while, and found I could tell him anything at all without feeling uncertain about how he\'d react, as if he already knew. I later spoke with my best friend, and just before she signed off I told her how much I held her dear. Music became an ecstasy. I played one song after the other, and each filled me with happiness. A peak experience was when I read an old e-mail of a good friend, in which she said she elaborately said how she happy she felt lately. (Yes, I could concentrate enough to read, but not very well.)\r\n\r\nI later went out, and had no problem to hide to the few passersby there were at that hour that I wasn\'t sober. I got nervous when I was passed by a police car a few times, but of course they couldn\'t see either. I was walking, or, at some point, running, at an amazing speed, however. Despite the time dilation, I found I got much farther than I\'d normally have in a very short time. (Later, in another trip, when I used them with others, I walked so fast they couldn\'t catch up.) I didn\'t feel even slightly uncomfortable in my body as I normally did when I was running - in fact, I felt as if I were floating. Everything seemed larger, and closer. At some point, when I was watching the stars, it felt almost as if they were christmas ornaments, and I could easily catch them if I flew high enough. Everything felt so close that it felt as if I were walking around in myself. Later, when I got back and looked in the mirror, the edges of my face seemed to be melting. That\'s as far as the hallucinations went.\r\n\r\nThe most amazing thing, however, is what happened to me afterwards. The next few weeks I still felt euphoric. I enjoyed everything in life as I would in my trip, basking in the aftereffects of the psilocybe."
90329,Determining Threshold Tolerance for Sclerotia,LadyLovelyLocks,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nSclerotia Experience Report \r\n\r\nPrevious experiences: MJ (daily), MDMA, LSD, cocaine, Salvia divinorum, hydrocodone, oxycodone, amphetamines, sedatives, benzodiazepines, sinicuichi, kanna, kratom, blue lotus, amanita muscaria, absinthe, alcohol, and others I\x92ve surely forgotten. I dabble frequently in the realm of ethnobotanicals, less often in the realm of synthetics only because they are more difficult for me to obtain (which is probably a good thing).\r\n\r\nPreface: This was an experiment to determine my tolerance levels to a threshold dose, as I had never tried these before and couldn\x92t find many reports on sclerotia on the interwebs. I tend to have a strong reaction to psilocybin/ psilocin and its cousins (a 10mg dose of 4-Aco-DMT literally knocked me on my ass \x96 I actually passed out for a moment when it kicked in - and a 3.5g dose of mushrooms of an unknown strain brought complete ego death and gnosis). So my goal was to play it safe and see what kind of experience 5g fresh sclerotia would bring. \r\n\r\nFrom my research, Sclerotia are roughly 70% water by weight while mushrooms are around 90% water. Dry sclerotia are 2/3 as potent as dry cubensis fruits, while fresh sclerotia are twice as potent as fresh cubensis. This is due to the fact that sclerotia contain 3 times more dry matter per quantity of fresh material.\r\nTherefore, 30g fresh cubensis equals 3g dried, which is almost an eighth. (So to get the equivalent of 3g dried experience with fresh mushies \x96 30g, one need eat only 15g fresh sclerotia as the fresh are twice as potent. To get the equivalent of 3g dried mush, 4g dried sclerotia would be needed, as dried sclerotia are 2/3 weaker than dried mush.) IF MY MATH IS CORRECT!  5g fresh sclerotia should = 1g dried cubensis. I am horrible at math, but even I had the patience to puzzle this one out (laugh as you like).\r\n\r\nDate & Time: 3/16/11 5pm\r\n\r\nSet: good mental state, been looking forward to this. Did my regular Wednesday routine, which consists of an hour and a half of yoga in the morning, some light chores throughout the day, and transporting my grandmother from daycare in the afternoon. Haven\x92t eaten since last night. Starved. Expectations not too high, just hoping to get some noticeable effects. \r\n\r\nSetting: home, alone (which is usual for me). I was in my dining room, wrapped in a comfy robe, happily plopped down in front of my computer. \r\n\r\nMaterial, dosage, & method of ingestion: 5g fresh psilocybe Mexicana sclerotia mixed with salad, sclerotia among first bites.\r\n\r\nT= 5pm\r\n\r\nWhat follows is my experience as it was happening (I only edited my abbreviations; I apologize for any TMI):\r\n\r\nThey taste like\x85 imagine this: mushrooms. Not quite as mushy. Consistency is denser. Earthy, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but not a disagreeable taste at all. Mixed in a salad, I can\x92t even tell they\x92re there. If my calculations are correct, this should be the equivalent of 1g dried shrooms. \r\n\r\nT+20m: belly rumbles : I\x92m digesting. Feel no alteration of consciousness yet. \r\n\r\nT+25: getting warning signs. Tryptamine chills. Music is starting to get interesting. Please gods don\x92t let it pull me so far inside that I can\x92t type. Lol.\r\n\r\nT+40: Stomach is starting to question what the hell I just put in it. No true visuals going on yet, but the computer screen seems to be waving a bit. Music sounds fantastic.\r\n\r\nT+50: Goom visualizer on VLC is REALLY cool. Starting to get body load aside from queasy stomach: tired, heavy feeling in body but light in head. Should go see what my pupils are doing but I don\x92t wanna get up. Lol. Need to pee anyway and considering making ginger pu-erh tea.\r\n\r\nT+58: peed. Checked pupils, not much different than normal. I can feel the poison in my veins, though \x96 and I really do think that\x92s how my body treats it \x96 as a poison. I get so fucking cold, yet sweaty at the same time. Starting to think that synthetics are the way to go for me \x96 much less nausea. Things outside look very pretty as they wave around.\r\n\r\nT+1h: this is definitely gentler than any other shrooms I\x92ve done thus far. Very controllable/ manageable. If I could only get my body to stop trying to go into shutdown/ preservation mode. The desire to sleep is almost overwhelming. I think doing this with a friend would be fantastic. And being outside would be even better. But the music would have to come with us.\r\n\r\nT+1h45: slowly returning to baseline. Not as cold, but the tea probably helped with that. Nausea passed. Music still sounds great, though. Still got one hell of a body high going on, but can only tell when I get up. Spent the last 45 minutes listening to music. Got some very subtle closed eye fractals. Definitely past the peak, though. I think I may actually like this.\r\n\r\nT+2h: visual effects pretty much gone, but music still sounds lovely and a nice headspace and body load remains.\r\n\r\nT+2h18m: This is now like the tail end of any mushroom trip. I can feel when it turns a corner in my gut and things get funny for a little while, then I fart. Woot. Feels very much like when my sister and I ate the chocolate shrooms once gifted to us, actually. Things are a little surreal, but I\x92m fully functional. Wonder if I\x92ll be able to sleep tonight. Hm.\r\n\r\nT+3h30m: ate. Nom. Basically back to baseline. But definitely a lovely afterglow. \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n\r\nPhysical effects: the body load was a bit heavy and I felt quite sleepy at times. Only slight nausea present, which was a pleasant surprise (I have a very sensitive stomach).\r\n\r\nMental effects: music was AMAZING! I was listening to one of my favorite trance albums (Super8 & Tab \x96 Empires) and the music was just pulsing thru me. It was so beautiful, but in no way overwhelming. There was a bit of time distortion \x96 10 minutes would feel like half an hour. No real euphoria to speak of and no real ego loss. As far as visuals go, my vision pulsed a bit and there were some suggestions of fractals when I closed my eyes; watching the visualizer on VLC was really interesting, but there was nothing there that didn\x92t belong. \r\n\r\nI was very pleased with my experience overall. I think they\x92re more palatable than regular mushrooms and this was a gentle experience which I quite enjoyed, though I will increase dosage next time. I can\x92t wait for it to get warmer so I can play outside with a friend after eating these.\r\nBe Safe; Be Smart\r\nNamaste"
48936,System Overload,Verivalta,Mushrooms - P. mexicana & Cannabis,"\nBackground: I\'ve done marihuana, hash, mdma, mda, speed, ether, morning glory seeds, painkillers and mushrooms before, so I guess you can say I\'m a little experienced.\r\n\r\nSet & Setting: I was gonna eat the truffles with my girlfriend(J) and it was gonna be her first time. She had Psilocybe cubensis cause they\'re a good laugh and not too strong for a first timer. The trip was gonna take place in my entertainment room, where I have a comfortable couch, blacklight, pc with lovely sound system, and a wall full of flyer that\'s quite a sight with the blacklight on. I cleaned up a bit, putting everything away that could disturb us, lit some candles and incense and dimmed the lights. Then I arranged the music on my pc so we would have some cool stuff to listen to, aphex twin and some hard DnB as J loves that stuff as well. My mindset was actually pretty good, although I have been depressed for about a month I was feeling excellent. Same goes for J as she told me she was quite excited and was really looking forward to it.\r\n\r\nExperience:\r\n7:00PM \r\nWe ate the shrooms, they didn\'t taste too bad for me but J didn\'t like em that much. They still went in without a problem. We then sat on the couch and watched a family guy episode (petarded) which was quite funny. When that was done I put on some music cause\r\nI was getting a bit lightheaded. J agreed and I put on an Aphex Twin live set which has been a longtime favourite so I felt it was an excellent choice to get in the groove.\r\n\r\n8:00PM\r\nOk, Definitely tripping now, the wall of flyers was starting to shift and some posters were dripping, J was also having visuals and we were both kinda staring into our own little world. The last time I had taken truffles it kinda stayed at this point for visuals but I got really joyful and couldn\'t stop giggling. This time it was different though. For the first hour of tripping the visuals kept getting stronger and stronger to the point where I thought I was sitting on a cloud (the couch) and we were headed for a tornado (the wall was spinning like a maniac). I noticed J was tripping hard too so I asked her what she was seeing and if liked it, she really did and started laughing at everything and just having fun with me, which was all really pleasant.\r\n\r\n9:00PM\r\nWe are both pretty much off the world now. I\'m lying down on the couch looking up and playing with an incense stick. J is standing in the middle of the room moving to the music and staring at the winamp visuals on the computer. We were in those positions for about half an hour just tripping like crazy. After that J came to sit with me on the couch and we started giving each other hand massages. The next day she said she thought I was made out of clay and she was trying to make a figurine. Also I must note that kissing is a really weird feeling like melting into each other.\r\nReally need to try that again cause it felt pretty awesome.\r\n\r\n11:00PM\r\nAt this time we were getting a bit fed up with being in the room all the time and I opened a window to catch some fresh air. When I looked outside, it was a full moon, REALLY cold, and there were like a zillion stars and the few clouds were looking A-MA-ZING. So we rushed outside and went for a walk. I live in a protected nature environment so it\'s really pretty. Normally I can\'t see shit when I\'m in the dark cause I\'m nightblind but now I had absolutely no problem seeing where I was walking. We went up a path for about half a mile stopping every 30 seconds or so to look up and gaze at the sky.\r\n\r\nFinally we made it to where I was planning to go. A giant pit in the ground, 30 metres deep, 150 metres diametre I think. We had a super fantastic view of the sky there and stood looking up for about an hour, holding each other and pointing out stuff and just in general being amazed about how fuckin\' beuatiful it was. After that we walked on and came to a slope where it was really dark. There the sky was even more amazing and at this moment I had a feeling of this intense connection to nature, I was so happy to be a tiny part of this spectacle and decided always to be nice to nature (I\'ve always been tho:)\r\n\r\n1:30AM\r\nWe got home, smoked a big joint (high quality hash and weed) and sat for about 15 minutes on the couch smoking it. This I believe was one of my errors of the evening. We should have just let the joint \'till the morning and talked for some more cos the weed & hash took away the feeling I had when we were outside. I just felt tired and I could feel my mind \'closing\'.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden I got a sense of panic and something inside me said \'oh-oh\'. I told J what I was feeling she said let\'s go to bed, some sleep will help (second error). I agreed and we went to my bedroom. At this time I could hardly walk and I knew something was up. I laid in bed, turned of the lights and BAM, I started thinking and thinking and thinking. The thoughts were coming a 100 times faster then when I\'m on speed and I could feel myself slipping away.\r\n\r\nThen I really started to get fucked up, I had made such an intense reasoning in my mind that I couldn\'t figure out what I was thinking or what the solution was. I WAS TRAPPED IN MY MIND!\r\n\r\nI tried to tell J my problem so maybe she could help me figure it out but all I could say was one or 2 incoherent words, think about them for 1 second and just completely forget whether I had said them or just thought them. This made me slip away in fear cause I was convinced I had made terrible error and now I was doomed to live like this forever, only being able to oppress the speeding thoughts for a few seconds to babble something impossible to understand and then just slipping into fear again.\r\n\r\nBeing so completely of the world I had forgotten that J was on her first trip and I didn\'t realise how much I was scaring her. At one point I tried to explain my \'headfuck\' problem to her and got stuck after 2 words. She whispered \'Please say it honey, just say it\' and I could hear the desperation in her voice. This kinda catapulted me back into myself and I was able to from a few sentences \'J, am I babbling fucked up shit?\'. She hesitated and I said \'Please be honest this is an emergence, J tell me!\' She said I was and said she was very worried.\r\n\r\nI told her I had a problem in my head that I was unable to get out of and that I needed her to try to talk me out. She tried as good as she could but having no experience with tripping people she was unable too (I wish I made her read a guide on psychedelics [error3]). At this point my heart was pounding like crazy and my there was pounding in my head at like 300 bpm. I started shaking real bad and then J took my hand and curled up against me. I realised I was not alone, she was here for me and I was tripping! Relief went through me for a moment. But oh shit, there come the speeding thoughts about the problem again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I told J I was getting up to listen to some music. I went into my other room and tried to focus on the music and lyrics. At first I couldn\'t even remember the lyrics of my fav song and that made me freak out once again. But after about 15 minutes I was able to slowly sing along and I felt my hearbeat slow down, the shaking also went away a little bit I was able to focus on something like reading.\r\n\r\nI was so happy about it that I sat in my chair listening to some music and sorta getting myself back together before I went back to bed. I came into the bedroom, J looked up to me and I said \'Hey hun, it\'s me again. I\'m okay now\'. Then I just crashed and slept for a few hours. In the morning I had a TERRIBLE headache that felt as if I had a terrible overload on my brain and there was a short circuit. I could barely walk and lost some speaking ability. Other than that I was feeling okay.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nThis was a really weird trip for me. I saw the most beautiful things when we were outside (WOW!) and then I got locked inside my own mind (VERY intense feeling of total terror). I kinda believe that the bad trip came from not being able to comprehend the beauty of what I saw and I just went into some kind of overload. The first part of the trip was too good to be true, a real life changer, and the aftermath was HELL. Guess thats the price to pay, I\'m just glad I got out of it and I\'m feeling normal again."
35447,Throwing the Stone,Roobs,"Mushrooms - P. mexicana, MDMA (ecstasy), Cannabis & Passion Flower","\nI\'m a healthy 22 year old male with a fairly broad experience and deep respect for all things mycological (I just plain love shrooms!) I\'ve tried three varieties of australian psylocibic mushrooms and also amanitas, and thought that I had seen all that the area had to offer in terms of fungal entheogens.  Not so.  My friends came to me one day, with the healthy glow that is apparent after any shrooming, and told me of a strange creature called a philosopher\'s stone, a truffle if you would. \r\n\r\nCuriosity prompted me to hit the net and do a little research.  Growing mushrooms is apparently common place in the rest of the world, but in australia cow paddocks are so plentiful and the weather quite favourable for cubensis developement for often as long as four/five months of the year, and amanitas are available in autumn and the onset of winter.  There\'s just no need to grow them.  A Philosopher\'s stone is apparently a dormant form of psylocibe mexicana and the truffle, which is scientifically called a scleriole, is more potent than a fruiting body.  I was intrigued and quickly aqquired some of this precious fruit, about 7-10g sold in a small container.\r\n\r\nI\'m a fairly experienced tripper so I thought that I\'d fast for a few hours before my trip.  This turned out later to not have been long enough, or my digestion was impaired.  I prepared a weak tea of passionflower, maybe 5g.  I don\'t think this would have contributed much to the trip intensity but don\'t mind the taste and a v.weak maoi couldn\'t hurt.  I also had a small toke of cannabis to get me feeling a little mellow, something that I find always helps at the start of a trip.  Cannabis has excellent synergy with most tryptamines and it\'s helpful for those who hate the taste of mushroom as it takes away most of the nausea.  I prepared the fruity smelling powder (I assume it had been ground) in a chai tea, and began to drink the vile brew.  It\'s not as bad as a lot of things I\'ve drunk but still gag-able.  \r\n\r\nI was suprised to hear a knock at the door.  My buddy G and his mates had rocked up looking to swap some grass for an e, and to see if I wanted to go out that night.  I explained to them what I had just taken and they were all a little apprehsive about shrooms themselves but seemed intrigued and began to put the pressure on me to go out clubbing.  I was a bit intrepid, having a respect for all things hallucinogenic, especially untried ones, but as I began to feel that nervous excitement that is common in the onset of most drugs, I found myself getting dressed, rolling a joint and hitting the town.\r\n\r\nAs I started to come on I began to remember why I liked mushrooms so much.  Though I was headed out into a public place I wasn\'t nervous, there was no danger of me getting into any trouble while I was with so many of my friends who at that stage I was beggining to bond with strongly.  They all appeared beautifically serene, though I later was told they were all totally drunk, rowdy and possibly on any other assortment of chems.\r\n\r\nTracers had begun at that point and the ride into town was like a kaleidascope of colour, movement and sound, bouncing along to a primal beat that only intensified as we entered the night club.  At this stage the intensity of the shrooms went through the roof and I was dancing and flying round the room on the backs of the lasers shooting out of the ceiling.  There was an excellent dj playing tripped-out dance and house and almost everyone was there on the dance floor.  At the risk of being labelled excessive I thought that now was the perfect time to take X.  I had candy flipped before but only ever with lsd, never mushrooms, which I infinitely prefer.  \r\n\r\nThat may have been a slight mistake.  I got a little nautious but that quickly passed after one of the hugest and most amazing spews I have ever had, quite disproportionate to the amount of food I had eaten.  Not essentially painful but intensly visual.  If I tried to close my eyes as I was throwing up I would immediately be transported somewhere else, a room in my head of psychadelics.\r\n\r\nThe bass of the club was like a living thing and as the x came on the walls of the toilet shimmered and turned to obsidian.  Phantasmal medicine women came leaning out of the walls and stroked my hair and told me that I would be alright and not to be upset.  A dog made of black glass popped out of the floor and wagged its tail.  Its lolling tongue made me realise I was no longer feeling sick to my stomach.\r\n\r\nThe toilet bowl was a distant memory as I floated to the washbasins and cleaned my mouth out.  My reflection appraised me in a manner most unhumanlike.  It seemed fairly satisfied with my appearance and let me leave the bathroom into the throbbing womb of the nightclub dance floor.  I began to let the music take me and lost time and space in the throb of the kick drum.  Life was good.  Complex themes slipped into the primordial and all those around me were dancing and spinning in the swirling vortex of life.  Appreciation of others was profound, much greater than simple X empathy, rather a greater understanding of that person on a spiritual level.  I\'ve had a similar sort of experience with 2c-b and x.  \r\n\r\nI\'ll leave it there and say that it was one of the best mushroom trips I\'ve ever had.  My minor freakout was quickly dealt with and I\'m sort of proud to have been tripping that hard in a public area with minimal paranoia.  The hallucinations that I had from the philosopher\'s stone were great though not as strong as some of the cubensis trips I\'ve had.  However in comparison with the fungal material I ate and the physical sensation one sometimes gets with fresh mushroom, like getting poisoned, occasionally, was completely absent.  I\'m pretty sure the spew was MDMA related.  My poor stomach was no doubt shrunk to the size of a peanut.  \r\n\r\nThe whole experienced lasted with me dosing at around 22:00 and reaching a tentative baseline, which I knocked on the head with a joint and a valium, at around 06:00 the next day. This will go down as one of my best drug experiences to date.  I make no pretence of looking for spirituality on this occasion.  It was pure fun."
58438,Absolute Helplessness and Despair,druglord,Huasca Combo (Syrian Rue & M. tenuiflora) & Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI just had possibly the most frightening experience of my life where I reached a state of total confusion and disorganization for a period of about 4 hours.  I prepared an ayahuasca brew and drank it in about 5 minutes.  It was very bitter and acidic, a truly bad taste.  Then about an hour later, I wasn\'t feeling anything too powerful, so I decided to take a few long drags of mj off my vaporizer and swallow a capsule of p. mexicana.  I have lots of experience with mj and different fungi (in addition to a few other things), but had never experienced DMT.  This was the first time.\r\n\r\nRight after that, I started descending very rapidly into a state of total helplessness, and I very much regretted taking the p. mexicana capsule, knowing that when it kicked in in about an hour and a half, I\'d be feeling even more insane.  I felt as though I had hit rock bottom, that this is what death must feel like, being torn away forcefully from everything comfortable and familiar.  I don\'t know if the sudden descent into madness had to do with the mj as a booster or if the ayahuasca had at that moment (coincidentally) intensified.  Either way, I wanted desperately to purge and rid myself of this poisoning agent.  I must have dry heaved 10 or 20 times, but I could not get anything out.  I believe this was the reason, my trip was so bad: the ayahuasca was inside my body the whole time.  It\'s one thing to be insane, but it\'s another to be sick and insane at the same time.  That is the combination that ayahuasca provided, at least until there was a physical purge.\r\n\r\nThe purge is as much figurative as it is literal.  It is the point of absolute helplessness and dispair--the point at which things can get no worse.  I was so thoroughly humbled by this experience that I now have a profound appreciation for love and acceptance.  Unconditional love is truly a beautiful thing.  I was scrambling desperately to find some amidst the terror, snot, sweat, and blood that I was stuck in.  I was not only scared by this experience, but I was wired, running from one room to the next, looking for a way to escape the suffering, hurting myself in the process.  I have several bruises and scrapes on my body, including on my right hand and wrist.  I know that was from pounding my fist in frustration on the toilet seat after so many failed attempts to purge.  I spent about half an hour cleaning blood from the carpet and walls afterwards.  I would not recommend trying ayahuasca (or anything equally intense) for the first time without an experienced sitter.  I learned a very hard lesson.  It\'s going to be hard for me, after this, to ever underestimate the amount of pain that we are capable of feeling."
22625,"Splashing Water is Heaven, but There Is Hell",Hix,Mushrooms - P. mexicana & Cannabis,"\nI noticed that there are very few trip reports for Philosopher\x92s stones, which are fresh psilocybe mexicana truffles (apparently they are not-yet-fruited mushrooms). Very similar to magic mushrooms, the main psychoactive compounds are psilocin and psilocybin, although there are thought to be other alkaloids present which are thought to influence a trip, as with other magic mushrooms. The big advantage of the \x91stones is that they are legal in the UK (I don\x92t know where else), and unlike magic mushrooms the truffles resemble a nutty tasting breakfast cereal.\r\n\r\nI bought the \x91stones from a UK website, and incredibly due to some heaven sent cock-up received 50 grams instead of 15! They arrived the morning after a sleep over at my house with three great friends, where we smoked lots of marijuana. We planned to trip that day, with three of us taking the \x91stones and one not. Although it was slightly spur of the moment, we had planned to take \x91shrooms for some time, had been seeking them for over a month, and had read-up on them. It was everyone\x92s first trip, but we were all experienced daily cannabis smokers (bud not resin!) and regular drinkers at Uni. It is worth mentioning that the previous night Homer, Bonham and I had all got breakthrough \x91trips\x92 with some Salvia x5 extract, and anyone who has read about Salvia breakthrough trips knows that this is quite a big experience. \r\n\r\nThe three of us each stewed approximately 5 grams of \x91stones in a cup of tea for 15 minutes, then drank the tea and ate the soggy truffles at the bottom of our cups. We had all eaten a light breakfast a few hours before, and everyone except me was scoffing popcorn around this time. After about 20 minutes Bonham and I agreed that we could feel a slight change in our general perception, and I definitely felt quite a strong anxiety-like apprehension, despite being quite happy and excited at the prospect of the experiences to come. It is quite hard to gauge time passage, but the trip got steadily stronger over the following hour, reaching a plateau after about one and a half hours. \r\n\r\nAs the trip grew in strength my perceptions became more and more altered. When looking around and moving early on it felt slightly like being drunk, because my coordination was piss poor and there was a slight moving of my field of vision. I also went and looked at my pupils, which were massive.  \r\n\r\nVisually the trip became really good after about 45 minutes. I agree with many people that the term \x91hallucination\x92 is often not an accurate description of the visuals, at least at lower trip levels. Visually I never saw any object that wasn\x92t there, but my visual perception was greatly altered when compared to sober vision, which is after all just another subjective state of perception. \r\n\r\nPatterns, especially bright and colourful ones, were brilliant to look at. The more complex and varied the better. My sleeping bag had a bright, colourful and contrasting varied-shape pattern, and when looked at the colours seemed brighter, almost shiny, and definitely more beautiful. The colours also seemed to subtly yet rapidly change hue. When looked at with the periphery of my vision, even just outside my central vision, the pattern flowed and pulsed. This occurred with most objects and surfaces, even if the pattern was relatively dull or non-existent. Visually contrasts, patterns, bright colours, lines and shapes all became \x91alive\x92 when I looked at them with my periphery vision. They seemed to move about, and I could often seemingly see faces, objects and 2d patterns in them, just like the periphery visualisations I experience when really high. Things also looked generally more beautiful, more alive and \x91better\x92 than in every day vision. Aldous Huxley was definitely correct in saying that \x91this is how one ought to see\x92, even though he was tripping on mescaline at the time. \r\n\r\nAs the trip came on stronger, probably after an hour or so, I could see extremely bright, electric looking lines move about in patterns and surfaces in the periphery of my vision. It often looked like lightening except more colourful, often shimmering between different colours. Looking around, or looking at moving objects was also greatly altered. Bonham and I agreed that a good analogy is that everything looks like a film that has a low frame rate. This is because everything moving in our vision proceeds in jerks, although smoothly and often seemingly slower than with sober visual perception. The brain seems to miss \x91frames\x92 and it almost looks like slow motion, although we can still strangely tell that everything is moving at normal speed. Bizarre but really interesting and calming. \r\n\r\nI find it hard to describe what I felt physically, but I realised quite soon that I had underestimated the physical effects, and they were always strongly apparent throughout the trip, and lasted the longest out of any of the effects. There is an increased awareness of the physical body, and this often makes relaxing harder, things can often feel somehow \x91nicer\x92 to the touch. \r\n\r\nEmotionally I was feeling quite happy, but mentally I was often overwhelmed by the state I was in, due to the incredible sensory flow of information from the outside world. However a lot of the anxiety faded as the trip became stronger, and as the intensity of it increased I often felt too overwhelmed to do anything except lie back and try to relax, and let my mind go wherever it wanted. However, all through the trip I found relaxation very hard, and I was extremely restless. \r\n\r\nMy mind became awash with random thoughts and observations that flashed in and out of my consciousness, and it was often so intense and rapid that it was annoying. It was very hard to participate in consciously directed trains of thought, my mind would flicker between thoughts however hard I tried to direct it. I remember watching a Smiths music video and loving the wonderful colourful pictures, but being unable to concentrate on and appreciate the music. I think it is much better to let go, and to experience oneself and the world while tripping without trying to control it, I certainly learned this.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so Homer wasn\x92t tripping very hard and so decided to roll a fat one with some lovely buds fresh from the \x91Dam. The weed definitely intensified the experience, especially visually, and Homer said that it worked wonders for his trip, making it much stronger. Next time I probably won\x92t smoke though, because it altered the trip to a more \x91knocked-out\x92 state of mind.\r\n\r\nIt is very true that the coming up period on \x91shrooms is experientially long. Because of my muddled mind that was racing at full throttle, and my lack of accurate time perception, I find it hard to recall the intense part of the trip accurately. Looking back it seems like a dream, where I can only recall faded fragments and images of the events. The trip was going really well, and we were all really enjoying it, despite all agreeing that we had a little nausea. Unfortunately it all turned bad when I went to the toilet, more than an hour after kick-off. \r\n\r\nStumbling around and becoming ecstatic at the beauty of the splashing water in the sink (it was the best thing I looked at while tripping, and the most beautiful thing I have EVER seen) I became aware of my friends voices in the next room, and I thought I heard words like \x91sick\x92 and a general commotion. I told myself I was imagining it and came back in, only to be passed by Grace carrying a bowl of sick to the toilet. \r\n\r\nI entered the room and one of my beds had a big pool of sick on it, and poor Bonham was lying on my other bed (I have 3), head near a bowl, rings as black as death around his eyes, and skin as white as chalk. Only one minute ago he had been fine, this was the biggest shock I have ever experienced. I soon realised what a bad trip was all about, and how easy it is to set one off even with a seemingly innocuous situation. I rapidly became conscious that my natural neurotic anxiety had shot off the scale. Thoughts spun round and round my head, on and on, and I couldn\x92t stop trying to plan through what I should do. My mind became a mass of revolving thoughts and plans, whilst I tried to calm myself down and think through rationally what to do. I realise now, as I did at times then, that from here onwards it was just a big fucking battle: me against my trip. This is the worst thing I could do, you can\x92t beat a trip into submission, you just get unbelievably anxious, worried and fearful, both emotionally, and physically. You also get really critical of yourself and angry at what you\x92ve done, and you feel such strong regret and pity, but the trip doesn\x92t get less intense. It was one of the most emotionally intense periods of existence I\x92ve been through, I felt a cascade of dark emotions, deep depression combined with regret, fear, anxiety, and often panic. At times I even feared I would break down.\r\n\r\nLooking back now it seems silly, because what had happened wasn\x92t remotely bad. It was not the end of the world, there was just a bit of a mess to clean up. Bonham was feeling better almost straight away, and the first thing he said when I came into the room was how much he was enjoying the trip again. My biggest fear at first was that he was ill, had overdosed, or whatever. If any of my friends came to any harm I wouldn\x92t even be able to deal with it when sober, but luckily this wasn\x92t even an issue. \r\n\r\nThe only real problem was that I had to decide whether to tell my mum, and get the sick cleaned up properly, or to deal with it as best we all could so as to keep her in the dark over our tripping in my room. I was really scared about her finding out, although this was really out of character for me. My mum knows we smoke weed in my room, and accepts it, but I would rather she didn\x92t know that I use other drugs; but I also know that she would have helped us and probably not even questioned our drug use. \r\n\r\nInstead, from the sick episode onwards it was a manic stumble around as I hopeless tried to clean two days of slobbing combined with a sick soaked bed, along with lots of help from all my lovely friends, who were also having bad trips thanks to the events and general environment. When a situation gets anywhere near uncomfortable when tripping it can soon escalate into the worst period of existence in one\x92s life. I know that\x92s exactly what it felt like to me. I was fighting everything, except my friends, who I knew were always there for me, and each other. \r\n\r\nIt was one of the most difficult times of my life, and the most intense experience I\x92ve ever had. If you can avoid it do. There is SO much I would be willing to do to have not had the trip turn bad.\r\n\r\nLuckily as time passed we all calmed down a bit, and we planned to get out the house and into the peace and seclusion of the country. We also found soft music helps calm a bad trip. However, after some manic cleaning I suddenly got the bizarre urge to talk to my mum. I never planned to tell her we were tripping, although the thought did seem comforting to me because I know she would have helped. Amazingly I had a really long, important and quite deep conversation with her. This really grounded me and helped me chill out, even though I had to watch myself to stay looking sober. It is a really strange experience having a deep conversation with your mum whilst tripping out and trying not to get sucked in to all the beautiful patterns flowing everywhere, I wouldn\x92t advise it for everyone. From here on the intense negative emotional states ended, and all that was left was anxiety until we got outside.\r\n\r\nWe drove to a really beautiful place on the hills above the town I live in that overlooks the whole valley. We chilled out, ate food, walked around, and admired the views for a while. It was about four hours into the trip, and I was definitely coming down at this point, but I still got brilliant visuals, with the grass and foliage making beautiful patterns to look at. I only saw a few flowers but they were also incredible to look at. It\x92s definitely much, much better to trip outside if you are sure to be safe, because it\x92s much more calming and interesting, and much more beautiful. \r\n\r\nOne of the most striking things was looking across the valley and into the valley at the town. The houses, hills and objects seemed so much closer it was unreal. Especially when concentrating on an object in the valley, it would seem so close and immediate that it was incredible. After some rock throwing we all went for a short drive before coming home to watch the Simpsons. \r\n\r\nAlthough more than 5 hours since eating the \x91stones I was still quite far off baseline, and could quite easily go in and out of trippy states, like in a deep stoned state, bringing some life to patterns, shapes and colour contrasts in my immediate and less immediate periphery vision. The physical feelings of intoxication with \x91shrooms were more apparent than the visuals, and I was really surprised to still be feeling subtle intoxication about 10 hours after eating them. \r\n\r\nAfter the Simpsons everyone left. I spent the evening relaxing, and thinking a little about my experiences, although I did get quite depressed for no apparent reason. I also found that getting to sleep was quite hard, although I often find sleep a problem anyway, and I was not totally sober until the next morning. \r\n\r\nTripping definitely works with my personality and can really accentuate my traits. If you are naturally prone to problems like depression and anxiety then be careful, they certainly got worse for me, as did my manic desire to constantly do \x91things\x92. However the parts of me that I hate only became accentuated when the trip got bad. During the good part of the trip I felt really happy when the anxiety went. I think the main thing for people worried about emotional states is to plan well, if the trip had gone well all day I\x92m sure I wouldn\x92t have had any problems being happy. \r\n\r\nI\x92m still really glad for the whole experience, even the bad part, because I learned a lot about myself and gained such an unusual experience compared to everyday life that I think it can only broaden and expand my mind. Looking back the most striking thing is that the cause of the bad part of the trip, and it really was hell for a few hours, was so innocuous that it\x92s just laughable now. All my friends agreed that despite the problems they also felt that it was a really worthwhile experience. We are already agreed that we will trip again, although this time with more respect for drugs, and a lot more planning.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that the night after the trip I got quite stoned, and began tripping quite strongly. I got quite a few of the effects I got from the \x91stones, but I found it hard to sleep for a few hours and it was not especially pleasant. Luckily this hasn\x92t happened again since, so don\x92t panic too soon if you get anything odd happen after a trip.\r\n\r\nSorry for the length for you lazy readers. I hope this report can help people planning to trip for their first time.\r\n\r\nBe kind; be happy."
34514,I See More Beauty Now,mGoLos,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nGood Times! \r\n\r\nMy best friend and myself decided to get together on a sunny saturday. Unknown to him I had recently purchased 30g of fresh Psilocybe Mexicana. After a few beers I told him the happy news. We were a bit nervous, I only have limited experience with *real* hallucinogens and only bad trips. That was about to change.\r\n\r\nWe started by drinking 15ml of liquid C as an energi-booster for the upcoming ride which we expected to be a long one. We also had around 5 beers each. We had eaten a healthy meal 30 minutes prior to dosing. I had dried the shrooms and put them in gel-caps, 9 caps each, down the hatch.\r\n\r\nAfter about 30 minutes the first little effects were felt, mostly mental ones, we both had a strong feeling that *something* was a about to happen. 30 minutes later the first body-effects were felt, tingles, overall euforia, giddiness and basically having a great time laughing, talking shit, listening to music and chain-smoking. Damn we had fun.\r\n\r\nAt the two hour mark we were sweating heavily, pupils were wildly dilated and it was hard to sit still, breathing felt good, smoking felt goood, stretching was awesome and we both felt very light, walking was more like floating. We decided to go downtown. \r\n\r\nWe walked into a park that overlooked the harbour and the ocean front. The scenery was amazing, the clouds looked like normal clouds, but I saw them with new eyes, I saw a majestic beauty of white rolling cotton and foam. The ocean however, did NOT look normal, the waves suddenly multiplied by 10 and some of them rolled backwards, others just appeared and dissapeared immidiately. It scared me a little because there was no way to tell that it wasn\'t real. This was a not a visual disturbance, this was a real hallucination.\r\n\r\nMy friend had trouble keeping up with me, everything he saw had to be studied up close. Just as I he saw only beauty and was completely at ease. The moment he saw that ocean front something strange happened. He took off his shirt and threw it away saying that it reminded him of bad times. We walked further into the trees, visual disturbances were constant and quite clear, I hardly noticed them until I turned around and looked up into the treetops, the tops were intertwined and looked like a camouflage net and for about a second I saw and heard a helicopter coming up behind it. It was so vivid, so incredibly real. \r\n\r\nWe decided to go home since I was beginning to freak out a little. We got back and enjoyed smoking, talking and grinning for about two more hours before coming down. My friend then borrowed my scooter and drove back for his shirt. We smoked a little hashish and went to bed. Sleeping was a bit difficult due to \'weak\' CEV\'s and auditory hallucinations...I kept hearing my friend yelling my name and stuff like that. The following morning I ordered 100g of the same mushrooms. Its going to be interesting summer :)\r\n\r\n<!-- Trip safely guys, don\'t do shrooms more then once a month. -->At times the trip felt a little dangerous and more then once I was not completely in control of myself. This is a powerful drug and by far the best and safest/healthiest trip I\'ve ever been on. I have done E more then once, but that stuff is really dangerous<!--  and before you know it you\'ll be popping pills every weekend, I\'ve seen it happen, after 6 months its no longer a pretty sight and they take more then two rolls a night-->. That None of us can get pure MDMA, its always strangely coloured pills with wierd markings, who know what the hell is in them. No drug compares to the intensity of rolling, not even shrooms<!--  and if you have an addictive personality, like me, then don\'t try it-->. The desire to do more is not worth the trip.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a fantastic night and I\'ll never be able to look at clouds or the oceans the same way again. Something has changed for the better inside me, I see more beauty now."
107456,Mystical Inner Vision,EnergyDragon,Psilocybe mexicana (sclerotia),"\nWe traveled to Amsterdam with one of my friends, and bought the mushrooms [psilocybin Hydra sclerotia truffles] there in a smartshop (it is legal / decriminalized there). We had some free days, and had a few trips; this current report is about the second and strongest trip.\r\n\r\nWe had a nice, calm apartment that we rented, and I slept a lot (8+ hours) before the trip; these are quite important for the big mushroom doses, if I want to enjoy it. I tried mushrooms before (but smaller doses), so I had some idea what it will be like, but this was the BEST and the DEEPEST, MOST UNIVERSAL trip of my life: I just loved it!!!  :-)\r\n\r\nI ate the mushrooms slowly, I chewed it thoroughly. I could feel its effect in about 25-30 minutes. At the beginning it just felt like some stimulant, like drinking several coffees. Then I could see some sort of \'spider web\' pattern on the walls and on everything around me. It was not scary at all, rather interesting and funny; it looked like everything was made of LEGO cubes. Slowly everything started to change colors, everything started to change like some rainbow: red-yellow-green-blue-purple... It is just totally beautiful, like becoming part of some Disney movie, or some Pink Floyd or Beatles music video. I felt funny, I was laughing a lot.\r\n\r\nThen everything started to flow slowly, the parts of the web started to become \'alive\': they flew together with the music, with my movement, with my thoughts... We played a lot of different kind of music (from our laptops) during the whole trip: classic trance, psytrance, goa, alternative, Japanese music, German songs, Indian songs, happy hardcore, meditative music, relaxation music...\r\n\r\nAfter a while I saw patterns on the white walls, and on everything. Eyes, mouths, small creatures. Like some kind of \'mini-evolution\', as they kept changing constantly. Everything was friendly, happy, funny... I loved it, although I was a little bit afraid, I did not want to lose control totally, I did not want to vomit or anything like this (this was the biggest dose of psilocybin in my life), but luckily everything went very well. Things started to look multi-dimensional: not just 3D, but 4D, 5D, 6D... As they started to move around, change, become fractal like, endless... I was beautiful and totally interesting, thought provoking... I just wanted to check out everything, play with everything and as I moved, the things moved together with me and with the sounds. The items in the room started to look like faces, animals, flowers, little complex buildings, strange supercomplex geometrical forms...\r\n\r\nThen later I lied on the bed and even with CLOSED eyes I started to see BEAUTIFUL patterns: endless fractals, small planets, galaxies, eyes, buildings, stars, bright lights... But not just randomly: I CONTROLLED EVERYTHING!!! With my hands, with my thoughts, and together with the music... I felt like I was GOD. I truly was! In my own little Universe - which was basically everything, and it was above this Universe; or rather my Universe included the whole physical reality... And it was really perfect! I was omnipotent and omniscient. I think afterlife must be something like this, if your soul is on a high enough level. When I opened my eyes I still controlled everything: i felt like I was a Bodhisattva, who just chose to come back to Earth. It was fantastic... Total, 100% freedom and happiness. I walked around a bit, spoke to my friend about a lot of funny and interesting stuff, about afterlife, we checked out some songs and funny videos, then I closed my eyes again on the bad. Then I closed my eyes again, and this time it was even DEEPER... I was not only a God, I was ONE WITH THE WHOLE FRACTAL UNIVERSE. Total EGO DEATH... Peace, love, and total annihilation. And still it was alive: the colorful fractal ocean kept waving in front of my closed eyes, and it felt like I have been tripping for an endless time... It could have been millions of years... I just felt like it was timeless, and perfect. Like Nirvana.\r\n\r\nLater slowly the effects began to decrease: I came back to my body, everything was still colorful, and happy. I felt sometime like an old dying man, sometime like a small newborn child lying in the crib. Sometime when I looked in the mirror I looked like some jolly alien, sometime like some kind of space wizard. I slowly came down from the trip. It was fantastic and awesome. I got back my life, my body, but I experienced ETERNITY. At the end of the trip I played with my laptop: I choose my favorite songs, wrote down some of my thoughts, the thins that I want to try in my life... I got new ideas, new inspirations, and my emotions became totally recharged. It felt like rebirthing, and I still feel like I got a New Life. It was funny, motivational, mystical and deeply spiritual.\r\n\r\n<!-- I can only recommend this kind of experience. -->As I mentioned, I think afterlife must be something like this; our current life is important too, but this was just deep and mystical. I could control everything: my body, the Galaxy, Atoms, Space, Time... I will definitely do a trip like this again in the future, maybe in 1-2 years. In the Netherlands this is legal (decriminalized?); so basically in any good smartshop one can buy this substance... :-)\r\n\r\n<!-- If you want to try something like this, my main recommendations are: do -->I would NOT do big doses in a party! <!-- With small doses a Psytrance / Goa party must be fun, but if you take 10 grams like I did, you will need to lie down. -->So a nice, calm flat with a bed is quite important. A lot of different music genres are good for this trip, but I should be able to choose, and change it according to my mood. If I were inexperienced, then I would start only with a small dose, like 1-3 grams maximum<!-- ; so the next time you can try more-->. My friend was also very helpful: we tripped together many times so far, so it is quite useful to have people around who also tried the same drug (so they can understand what do I experience during the trip). \r\n\r\nI think that is it. We all experience this current life only temporarily, we have to enjoy it. I think psychedelic trips together with meditation, self-analysis, and sharing the experiences with friends are pretty important way to understand our own Life and the whole Universe in a deeper way. Just be careful, and find happiness in every little thing, both in the \'normal life\' and during psychedelic trips too. \'DO NOT WORRY, BE HAPPY!\' :-)"
103724,Where Divine Joy Makes Worlds Collide,Straycat,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (sclerotia),"\nFirst off: I already have some experience with several substances (for example: MDMA & BK-MDMA, 2CB & BK-2CB, MXP, MXE, Diphinedine, 4FA) and have also consumed mushrooms before. The trip I am writing about was my fourth with shrooms in general, the second with magic truffles and the most intense and amazing drug-experience for me so far<!-- , and therefore I feel like I should share it with you-->.\r\n\r\nSet: having some personal issues going on, a lot of questions about my rather uncertain future nagging me, also some trouble with a good friend, among older and deeper issues with myself, which I have been trying to figure out for a long, long time. But overall, I am feeling quite cheerful and good this evening, having a prolonged weekend full of party and socialising with new people only halfway behind me, and looking forward to some nice tripping with my two closest friends.\r\n\r\nSetting: we are at my place, where I feel secure and comfortable. I\x92ve purchased a lot of snacks and drinks the three of us like to consume while tripping, we have enough cigarettes and my three super-affectionate cats around.\r\n\r\nt+0 (10 p.m.)\r\nSeeing as the truffles I had brought from my last visit to Amsterdam were close to nearing the end of their shelf life and us being in the mood for tripping, I chopped up 5g of the truffles for each of us and mixed them into some yoghurt, since the awful taste becomes more bearable that way. The truffles were the sort \x93Galindoii\x94, which I was told was the strongest available, so I advised my friends to go easy on them, and wait for at least one hour before redosing. \r\n\r\nAbout 30 minutes after ingesting, I started to notice the first signs of the onset: slightly blurred vision, giving a soft violet shimmer to everything. My mood is rising, my body feels lighter. I decide to go sit in my living room and surf the net a bit, looking at random pictures and listening to some music.\r\n\r\nt+1 - t+3 (11 p.m. - 1 a.m)\r\nOne of my friends and I decide to redose, while my other friend declines due to having to go home soon. I measure out 6g of the truffles for the two of us and mix mine into joghurt, while my friend decides she will eat hers pure. I go back to the living room and chill out in front of my PC, whereas my friends remain in the kitchen to chat. While I am sitting here, my headspaces increases more and more, making me feel lighter and lighter. I see colourful tracers when I look at moving objects, surface appear to be breathing slowly, and everything looks and feels more beautiful. I put my ear on one of my cats fur, and it feels amazing, the sound of his purring is just beautiful, peaceful and soothing. I have a feeling of unity, like becoming one with my environment, the music, the cats, the room I am in - everything fits together perfectly, and I am part of it. I am feeling very happy and deeply relaxed, at peace with me and my surroundings, while at the same time tripping hard\x85 and I feel that I can handle even more, so I decide to redose once more, at 1 a.m., 3h into the trip. I have none of the \x93Galindoii\x94-truffles left, so I go for \x93Dragonslayer\x94,  the second strongest sort I purchased. This time, my friends decline both: one needs to go home now, and the other one is to occupied by her thoughts and not feeling much of the shrooms she already consumed.\r\n\r\nI have no yoghurt left, so I chop up 6g truffles as small as possible and mix it into some cocoa, which I slowly drink - it tastes amazing, and it masks the truffle-taste perfectly. I smoke a cigarette (which also tastes amazing) and go back to the living room. I constantly write updates on twitter about what is going on, and I enjoy talking about it, philosophing about how reality was just an illusion and how each and everything that lived made their own reality.\r\n\r\nI start to feel as though my body is becoming light, warm and numb at the same time, as though my skin is dissolving into something warm and fuzzy. From time to time, I experience the feelings of heat and cold on various body parts, but it doesn\x92t feel like those feelings happen inside of my skin, but on it, like cold or warm metal is lightly brushing over it. My open-eye-visuals are getting more intense now, I can see wild, moving kaleidoscope patterns, every surface looks as tough it is alive and gently breathing, or as if something is moving around below them, also I see colourful tracers of everything when I move my eyes. At the edge of my visual field everything morphs into twirls and tendrils and appear to be pulsing with light and shadow. Also, little objects that are brighter than their surroundings look to me as tough they are painted with neon colors and illuminated by black light. My closed-eye-visuals consist of the same kaleidoscope patterns, but way more colourful and vivid, there are floral patterns, crystal shapes, spirals, hieroglyphs, all morphing into each other to the sound of music.\r\n\r\nt+4 (2 a.m.)\r\nThis is the time I realised that this experience was going to be something special. My friend had gone to bed, so I was left alone in the living room, and I decided to just let things happen from now on, to see where it would take me. I was starting to feel this wonderful unity with everything again. I was in perfect harmony, deeply relaxed, enjoying the music, the visuals, and then I suddenly realised that there was something else, that I was not alone. It was as if in my head some kind of friendly spirit, a guide, a reliable friend hat manifested. I intuitively sensed that I could trust that spirit, that it was well-meaning - I was feeling safe and cozy, as if a loving, caring mother had taken my hand to show me the wonders of the universe - because this is where it wanted to take me. I gave in. I relaxed. I knew that no harm could happen to me\x85 that I could trust my mushroom-spirit-guide.\r\nIt took me deeper and deeper into space, where at first chaos, movement, excitement, emotions ruled\x85 but the deeper it took me, the quieter it got. And while I was going there, I felt how layer after layer of me vanished. The closer I got to the center of the Universe, that one point where there is nothing anymore, no chaos, no movement, no excitement, no emotions, except perfect balance, the more I was reducted, layer after layer, and with every layer that went away, the peace in my mind grew deeper and deeper. And then - the balance was perfect. I had reached Nirvana - I had acquired total, cosmic peace. Total, perfect equilibrium. \r\n\r\nAs I was floating in this perfect state\x85 an amazing, fantastic, bright shooting star shot across my inner night sky, and made me erupt in total euphoria. What did cause this shooting star, you may ask? Well, you see: another friend of mine, who was miles away and tripping on LSD with her boyfriend had send me a picture of her eye in this exact second. In her eye, I could see that same light, that sparkle, that I could feel in my own eyes, and I was completely overwhelmed with joy. This moment, I can not describe other than as an encounter. There were billions and billions of lose ends trailing through this gigantic, wonderful universe, and against all odds, it were our lose ends that met and connected - for a moment, we were sharing the same world. I told her about what I had just experienced, and she confirmed that she had experienced the same. And I filled up with joy, absolutely pure, untarnished, divine joy that had made our worlds collide and briefly forged them into one\x85 and then that joy changed and became love. Pure, divine, untarnished love, that moved me to the core and made me cry out of sheer emotion.\r\nDuring the course of the night, there were several similar encounters with this woman, and every time it happened and our worlds merged into one for a moment, this overwhelming feeling of joy and love returned.\r\n\r\nt+5 (3 a.m.) \r\nThis outburst of euphoria left me warmer and cozier than ever. I put on my favourite hoodie and it felt as if the whole world was snuggled up with me within it. Still, I was flooded with love, love for everything, and the friendly spirit that was guiding me was close by all the time.\r\n\r\nI had a bit of appetite and ate some pineapple, which just tasted incredibly good, although I usually can\x92t stand pineapple, and cried again because of the love that still filled me and everything around me. Everything was so peaceful and comfy, warm and safe - it was like floating in some warm liquid\x85 Everything was so peaceful and comfy, warm and safe - it was like floating in some warm liquid\x85 a feeling of being back in the womb.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I wanted to smoke a cigarette, so I got up and went to the kitchen. Upon walking, I realised that I still had visuals, but they had become secondary and I was not super interested in them, even though they were pleasant and not at all disturbing. As I arrived in the kitchen and sat down at the table to smoke, I suddenly realised how different it felt, compared to the living room - somehow much colder, exclusive and kind of depressing. Thoughtful, I finished my cigarette and went back to my computer to tweet about this strange occurance. After a while, it dawned on me: whenever I\'ve had a fight with someone, whenever something had made me cry, it had happened at the kitchen table, but never in the living room. \r\n\r\nAt this point, I talked to my LSD-tripping friend again, and immediately the euphoria was back, and so was this intense, pure love, and again it made me cry with sheer happiness - never had I thought that one could feel like this, never had I thought that I was capable of such a powerful, wonderful emotion.\r\n\r\nt+6 (4 a.m.)\r\nStill moved, crying and yet full of joy and euphoria, I went back to the kitchen for another cigarette. As I set down and the feeling of rejecting and depression started to creep over me again, suddenly the friendly spirit that had guided me through the universe and beyond, that had watched over me all night and had reassured me that everything was safe, that spirit that I could not quite identify but nevertheless trusted, gently nudged me and took my hand. It led me away from the mouth of this dark path; it had something more important to show me.\r\n\r\nI was gently led down another path. Like at t+2, I could feel that I was, once more, becoming one with everything around me, but this time my friendly guide did not take me to the endless, wonderful dimensions of the Universe, but down into my very soul. I was not afraid; I knew I did not have to be. I was being led through a labyrinth, around obstacles, and I somehow realised that they depicted my fears, my pain, and that they resembled what I always had believed was ME but now turned out to not really belong to me: the feeling of not being loved, of not being good enough, of being a failure and worthless - those things had not been put there by me, but all those countless people that talked me into believing this about myself\x85 So long that they, in a way, had become part of me. But now I realised that there was a way to avoid those obstacles. Deeper and deeper the spirit took me into the rabbit hole, and the deeper I got, the more that absolute peace and tranquility I had felt before spread throughout me again. And just as I had reached the Nirvana once more, just as piece and equilibrium were perfect, another singularity like that shooting star two hours prior happened. Again, I had an encounter - but this time, it was ME.\r\n\r\nt+7 (5 a.m.)\r\nDeep down in the rabbit hole, where I encountered myself, I had an epiphany, and I was told so many things and learned deep, fundamental truth\x85 I was just so overwhelmed and humbled that my plain human senses could hardly compute what I was being told at first. One of my cats was lying on the sofa next to me (how did I get back from the kitchen to the living room? I must have sleep walked), slumbering peacefully, and I petted his soft coat and was filled with a rush of pride and love towards him - pure, absolute and unconditional love. And then I realised what I had been told: The love I was feeling was genuine, and it was there if high or not. This pure and unconditional love was my very core, the fundament of my soul, the fundament of ME. \r\nI was told that THIS was the love I deserved to give to myself, too! \r\n\r\nOver the years, my love towards myself had more and more reflected what I had become to believe was the love I deserved, the same \x93love\x94 given to me by abusers: never a reward, but only punishment and countless conditions, and being shamed and punished even more if I didn\x92t fulfill those conditions. I had learned that I deserved no better for being what I am, and that I should be glad to be bothered with at all. And that is exactly how I treated myself all the time: punishing myself, being ashamed of myself, believing that I was a horrible person\x85 and now, in this mind-blowing encounter with myself, I learned that this was not true.\r\n\r\nI learned that I deserved to love myself as unconditionally as a mother loved her children; the same way that I love my cats. \r\nI learned that I am allowed to make mistakes, and to forgive me like a mother forgives her child if it acts cheeky. \r\nI learned that it was GOOD to be me, that I had done nothing wrong to deserve what had happened to me, and that I was not guilty.\r\nI learned that gradually destroying myself, silencing, shaming and hurting myself was NOT the answer.\r\n\r\nDown in the rabbit hole, I finally learned that I did not strive for death, but to LIVE. For years and years, almost as long as I remember, I had thought that I wanted to die, but now I knew the truth. I had been enlightened - and now, I was feeling so relieved. I was crying again, uncontrollably, but they were good tears\x85 they were the tears of a child which had been stuck inside for over twenty years, and letting them go felt so good, all the while being cradled and held by that friendly guiding spirit, and I just cried, cried, cried until I ran out of tears. My eyes were puffy, tears, mascara and snot were smeared across my face, and I had to laugh at the thought of how I must be looking right now.\r\n\r\nt+8 (6 a.m.)\r\nI calm down and feel very peaceful again, sometimes disrupted by bursting out in laughter. I am so, so relieved. I brew myself some coffee and cherish the wonderful taste. I repeat to myself what I have just learned, and cry again, then I see something funny and laugh again. I am laughing and crying and giggly and philosophical at the same time, feeling completely insane and yet incredibly sharp. It is wonderful to be alive.\r\n\r\nt+9 - t+12 (7 a.m - 1 p.m.)\r\nI remain in a warm, still slight afterglow. I surf the web again, chat with friends and, bursting to tell someone about the amazing things I experienced that night, speak on the phone with my best friend. He is happy for me, and I am happy that he is happy, and I end up crying again, feeling more alive than ever. I feel like I was being born again, this time not with the blank mind of a child, but enlightened, wiser. I know that the love and joy I feel are genuine, that they are inside of me and that I can reach out and find them whenever I am in need.\r\n\r\nAt 1 p.m. - 12 hours after the last dose - I suddenly get incredibly tired. I go to the bedroom and snuggle up with one of my cats, and I fall asleep only a few minutes later, to colourful, cheerful dreams.\r\n\r\nThis trip was absolutely mind blowing. From tell-tale I knew that mushrooms have a lot of potential, but I would never have guessed that they can take me so far. I am so glad I just let this trip happen, to just let it take me to where it wanted me to be.\r\n\r\nTo all of you readers, and to all of you fellow psychonauts:\r\n\r\nI send you peace and love! <3"
106650,Scary but Interesting,meow,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI tried truffles for the first time in Amsterdam, in a smartshop with a tripping area in the back. I took one dose (10 g) of fresh truffles of what the shop attendant told me was the weakest kind they had, called Mexicana. He said I would likely just feel a bit giggly. I had not done psychedelic drugs before. \r\n\r\nSetting: The area was facing the windows with a beautiful view, some people beside me were tripping as well, and the DJ was playing nice music. \r\n\r\nI ate a small breakfast earlier in the day, but then nothing the hours before the trip. During it I had little pieces of nut bars that was being sold in the shop. \r\n\r\nI ingested the mushrooms around 16.00. The effect started after about 30 minutes, but subtly at first. Listening to music was enhanced, and I felt a bit weird but cheerful. It peaked between 17-18, and that\'s when it became quite uncomfortable. Not really hallucinations, but things flickered and vibrated as I looked at patterns. I also got dizzy and a bit nauseous from it. What I hadn\'t expected was that my social anxiety (that is normally under control) was worsened by the mushrooms. Even though I was in a safe place where the shop attendants were friendly and the other clients were tripping, I felt extremely self conscious and stressed. I wanted to close my eyes to escape the chaos, but was afraid I\'d fall asleep. I felt relatively clear headed in a way, but also detached from reality. A friend had offered me previously in the day to come and sit with me, but since I expected the trip to be mild I had declined. I tried to text him during this time and ask him to come over, but the letters on the screen moved too much and the task just felt too hard to go through with. I managed to calm myself down by looking at the watch and reminding myself that the peak was going to pass. Time passes very slowly in that emotional state though. \r\n\r\nAt 18.30-19 the trip started to feel a bit easier to handle. I sat in a more comfortable position, felt less tense, and was able to listen to and enjoy the music again. I thought a lot about myself, the people around me and things that had happened to me. Emotions I hadn\'t realised I had suddenly came to surface. Emotions I hadn\'t realised I had suddenly came to surface. Not in a bad way, I felt touched by it. I wanted to submit to the feeling and have a good cry, but I stopped myself since I was around people. But it felt like it had a healing impact on me nevertheless. \r\n\r\nThe effect from the mushrooms gradually went away and I felt steady enough to walk around a bit in the store at 20. When I left the smartshop at 21 I still felt high though, but sober enough to seem normal and function. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion: Lasted from 16-22, peaked after 1-2 hours. I will definitely try this again in the future, but not a full dose. Maybe a third or half of what I took. And while I think this kind of setting can be good for a lot of people, I will do it either alone or with people I know well. I would also eat more earlier in the day the next time, as I think it would have made me less dizzy. It was scary in the middle, but overall a beautiful and interesting experience."
43304,Mixed Feelings,Mosh,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (fresh),"\nThis is the report of the first time I ever used Mushrooms, or even any sort of psychoactive drug. I am 20 years old and an experienced smoker of marihuana (which is THANK GOD still real easy to get in Holland). I had a couple of intense experiences with eating hash (in an omelet and cake) which made me quite paranoid, and I tripped all the way home on my music, while the music was forming visual patterns. So, I thought that, since Paddo\'s are legal here in Holland, it couldn\'t be much more intense than the huge dose of hash I ate (about 3 grams). But I was wrong.\r\n\r\nWe started off with 5 friends, in the living room of one of them. K. Was the sitter so he just rolled a joint. It was about 4 a\'clock when we consumed the shrooms, the taste was not real nice, but okay.\r\n\r\nRight after that we decided to head to the nearby river. We didn\'t feel anything actually, just a bit giggly (hey, my first time, I didn\'t know that was part of the trip ;)). Only one of the dudes was totally freaking out on the clouds and such. So, we just sat there by the river, checking out some rocks, laughing about everything. And slowly it kicked in, and it was a heavenly feeling. Watching all the trees waving at me, the river greeting me, and I could see lines of energy flowing through the skies. I just felt perfect, and I thought this would be about it, since I didn\'t really take a large dose, and I didn\'t suspect anything much heavier than an intense hash-trip-thingy. I didn\'t really take a large dose, and I didn\'t suspect anything much heavier than an intense hash-trip-thingy.\r\n\r\nI think we sat there for about 2 hours (not bored for one second) and then we slowly walked home, enjoying the world we we\'re blessed to live in. We arrived back home, and a small detail is that the living room was decorated \'gothic-style\'. So lot\'s of dark, purple and skeletons and stuff. Normally I find it pretty stylish but now I found it a bit eerie.\r\n\r\nThen the trip really kicked in, with ashtrays growing and shrinking, music going right through me (I could physically feel the music on my eardrums). It might not seem very spectacular to you guys, but it was more intense then I ever imagined.\r\n\r\nBut then, the scary stuff started. To illustrate I have to tell that I have had several nosebleed after drinking a lot (like, REALLY REALLY a lot) or smoking lots of weed. I got nosebleeds during the night then. It kinda scared me a bit, but I didn\'t really pay attention to it. So, back to my trip. During my experience I couldn\'t feel what I physically felt. I couldn\'t check if I was hungry, and I kept wiping my nose because I just couldn\'t feel if there was actually snot dripping out of it, or if I was just imagining. Then I went to the bathroom, to finally deal with this annoying snot that was teasing me all the time. I blew my nose in some toiletpaper, but then the fear completely hit me. \r\n\r\nI looked in the toiletpaper and saw that my nose was bleeding, and it still was. And before that point in my trip I forgot about my nosebleeds in the past. But now it all came back to me.  I totally freaked out and stumbled into the living room and begged: \'please come outside with me, I\'m freaking out\'.\r\n\r\nSo then my vision started to fade out, it turned into a million gray dots, but through the dots I could kinda see the surroundings, but it was vibrating heavily. And I couldn\'t really here anything because all I heard was this extremely loud PEEP in my ears, but I could still hear voices, but they we\'re so far away. I really felt like I was passing out, and I try to fight it as hard as possible. I stood in the hallway trying to find the door to the outside, and I just stood there looking at my feet saying: \'yep, I\'m totally out of it\'... Repeating it several times. But trying to stay cool to my friends, my brain was screaming: \'Yes, you are now going to die, you did it to yourself.\' I was terrified.\r\n \r\nWhen I finally came outside my vision began to return and the colour-changing I experienced the whole day were going on overdrive! But it was beautiful, I was so relieved I didn\'t pass out or die. I just felt completely happy. But I had the greatest fear to go back inside we\'re the smoke is. I felt something like:  \'yes, this is good. This is we\'re I\'m supposed to be, outside with you lovely trees and blossom. I don\'t need to go inside where that devil-smoke is that pushes on your chest and wants to kill you\'.\r\n\r\nSo I just sat there on my own, on the street, watching the beautiful nature. At that point I was perfectly sure that, if I was suppose to die from mushrooms, during this trip, someone would make that clear to me. So I wasn\'t really worried.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to go back inside, I immediately turned really scared and I felt the dark room and the smoke pressing heavily on my chest. So I went outside again, but now my nosebleed-paranoia returned and I think I checked my nose about a 100 times.\r\n\r\nThe effect was beginning to wear of, and I could have normal conversations with my friends again. Still wouldn\'t dare to go inside though. So I just sat there.\r\n\r\nI think we went to the lunchroom at 8 o\'clock or so, and my fries were AWFUL. I had a coke with them, so I took a sip, and the rest of my fries just tasted like cola.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over I still felt happy in a way, but also a bit dissapointed in life. We just sat there in the bar, but I just didn\'t want to smoke, and why would I drink beer? It\'s so useless. I think I felt like that for about a week why would I drink beer? It\'s so useless. I think I felt like that for about a week.\r\n\r\nSo, my experience was in a way a perfect experience which made me come closer to nature, and respect the world around me, but was also terrifying, when I thought I would really die now.\r\n\r\nThe long term effects are minimal, but I do notice that I think about life a lot more, I\'m a lot more paranoid about nosebleeds, and check it a lot, and I stare at the clouds a lot, because I just KNOW it\'s there. The vibration and the energy in the skies.\r\n\r\nSo, it might not seem as much of a trip, but for me it was quite something ;). But I must stress, that it was absolutely neccesary that I be in complete harmony with myself and that I be not scared of something that might happen. <!--If you have a tiny fear about something in the back of your head it WILL be horrible during the trip, because you can\'t push it away anymore.--> Also being in the vicinity of sober friends, because IF something serious happened, I wouldn\'t want to be alone.\r\n\r\nI\'d really like to know what might have caused a nosebleed during a trip (with shrooms, or anything else)."
110215,The Wind Horse That Arises,Elf,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nSome Observations of Psilocybe Mexicana\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a free associative flow of imagery that was occasioned by our most recent experiment with our favoured teacher, the Psilocybe mexicana mushroom. As is often the case with these things, the expression is imperfect, but may serve as something of a \x93pointer\' toward what is unfolding for us now.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the original two participants committed to ingestion of another 13 pair - 1 gram - of the P. mexicana carpophores, \x93pajaritos,\x94 this time sans cocoa, while a third individual chose to take a half gram. The experience was quite familiar to me as I have undertaken this type of vigil many times over the past 40 years I have undertaken this type of vigil many times over the past 40 years. Without the cocoa, the onset of the experience was also fairly rapid. \r\n\r\nWithin approximately 20 minutes of chewing the mushrooms the first alert was felt and it rapidly deepened. Contrasted with the effects of combining cocoa with these mushrooms, the non-cocoa experience resulted in a much lower intensity of the closed-eye visuals, allowing for awareness to turn inward toward the deeper aspects of the psyche. \r\n\r\nWhat emerges for me at this point in my work with the spirit of the mushroom is awareness of a wind which moves through the inner body. The only literature that I have encountered that touches upon this phenomenon is the Dzogchen teachings on the \x93windhorse,\' or \x93lungta\x94 - which is described as a subtle energy that moves through the central channel of the inner body. For me, this wind manifests as an opening of awareness into infinite space, a spaciousness which moves through the body as a wind and which is actually experienced as awareness itself; not the individual awareness of the experiencer, but the awareness that is a unified field which pervades the entire cosmos. The individual awareness merges into this greater awareness and flows, free of all objects, in and through all forms. When the mind is concentrated upon the flow of this wind, awareness is free of all objects. There is no longer a \'me\' nor a \x91we,\' but a unified consciousness that is beyond the world of forms; in fact, it is from this spacious awareness itself that the realm of forms arises. When this awareness arises there is a passing of awareness beyond the realms of forms and formlessness. At this point, language fails - \x91presence\' is probably as good a word to speak about this as anything else. Here we move beyond signification to that certain \x93something\' itself. Nirvana actually translates directly as \x93blown out,\x94 the extinguishing of the flame of individual awareness. \x93The answer is blowing in the wind.\'\r\n\r\n<!--If we follow Peter Kingsley\x92s discussion of all this, in his book, \'A Story Waiting to Pierce You\' in the ancient Greek tradition surrounding Abaris, who arrived in Greece from Hyperborea (Mongolia) riding the \x93wind\' upon the Golden Arrow, which he presented to Pythagorus, who had a Golden Thigh, there is a convergence of imagery, drawn from that influx of awakened awareness that sowed the seeds of Western civilization over 2600 years ago. The psyche speaks in images and this set of images is at the heart of who we really are. -->It is the wind horse that arises for me during the psilocybin trance; concentrating upon the breath as the anchor for awareness has the potential to open the central channel to the flow of the \'wind horse,\x94 something available to us all, for it is our essential nature, and which has returned just in the nick of time to assist our awakening to the possibility of creating a new civilization, with a central focus placed upon stewardship of the fragile life of our sacred angel, the Earth. Or so this awareness asserts in my heart by its presence.\r\n\r\nMy fellow voyager from our P. mexicana - cocoa experiment tells that he was presented with a bringing into awareness of past traumatic material, a confluence of which is currently unfolding in a business relationship that he ventured into with a less than fully developed partner, who was not in compliance with the original agreement that had been established between them and was skirting the issue by casting blame upon my friend. This has been occupying his mind over the past several weeks, and he reached an inner resolution on a course of legal action that he had undertaken to manage the situation. He also noted that there was a lot of work being completed at a deep inner level that was both beyond and beginning to become emergent into his awareness. The opening proceeds in each of us at its own pace and at levels that the ordinary mind can begin to intuit, but cannot fully grasp. He commented some time after the experience. that \x91presence\' was active at a deep level and apparent in the responsiveness of those he is currently working intensely with.\r\n\r\nThe third individual in the small group has been studying to apply for entrance into a nursing program. When asked what she was experiencing, she noted that she asked \x93them\x94 to show her DNA, and was taken down into the double-helix to directly perceive the amino acid structures and the links between them. She asked to see metabolic processes occurring in the organ systems and was taken into the individual cell structure to apprehend it with direct awareness. The mushroom indicated to her that it would assist her in achieving her goals and open doors for her. As she explained these experiences to me, I recalled my own awakening, facilitated by serious work with the mushroom, begun over 40 years ago, to discovering my own destiny, and the promise and encouragement of the spirit in the mushroom to assist me in reaching what, at the time, appeared to be very lofty goals; all of which have been fulfilled beyond my wildest imagining. \x93On an everyday level, the windhorse is also very much linked to what is commonly known as \x91good luck.\x92\'\r\n\r\nFor all of us who have embarked on this new series of vigils with the mushroom, synchronicity again manifests at a palpable level. \r\n\r\nMy young friend was told by her academic advisor<!--, whose husband is the president of the college she is attending,--> that her admittance to the nursing program was assured in the fall. She also commented, following this last experience, \x93There\x92s something different about you. I don\x92t know what it is, but definitely something different. Very mysterious.\x94"
110213,In Combination With Cocoa Aztec Style,Elf,Mushrooms - P. mexicana & Cacao,"\nOver the past several years, we have been closely working with the Psilocybe mexicana mushrooms grown from spores collected by a longtime friend near the slopes of El Cerro de Adoracion in Huatla de Jimenez (otherwise known as the \'Chicon Nindo\' strain of this mushroom). My friend and I have become quite familiar with the range of effects this species can elicit. We have found that about 10 pair generally weigh 1 gram (dried), which is a solid dose for this petite species. To test the effects of cocoa on the experience, I obtained some brewing cocoa from Chocolate Alchemy and brewed it in the Brazen Brewer Plus (highly recommended).\r\n\r\nJust prior to eating the mushrooms, we each took about 11 pairs, we began sipping this exquisite cocoa, sweetened with a little raw cane sugar and cream, while we quietly chewed the little things. As the effects came on, there was a noticeable difference. I am not prone to intense visual hallucinations. I typically experience the P. mexicana trance as merging into a deep silent stillness and the mind opening to awareness of the inner planes with great clarity. On this occasion, the cocoa synergized intense, surging visual imagery, flowing and pulling awareness deeply into it, with an occasional 3 dimensional perspective shift and deep interstellar space opening up with scintillae of starlight shining through. It was the most spectacular visual experience that I have ever experienced with this strain of mushrooms. It left both of us in no doubt that cocoa has a synergistic effect when combined with psilocybin. It is interesting to note that it was very common for the Aztecs to consume their mushrooms (and likely this particular species) in combination with cocoa.\r\n\r\nWe plan on conducting a series of trials in which we alternate cocoa with no cocoa to confirm our observations. We are very interested if anyone else has made this experiment and have made similar observations."
22737,Feeling the Love of Nature,Doz,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI tried the philosophers stone truffles with a few friends last friday. The method for taking them suggested on the internet was in tea, so we prepared 10g each using a garlic crusher and added that to a cup of tea. We didn\'t have any other drugs that afternoon other than the truffles.\r\n\r\nThe weather was really nice and sunny so we decided to sit outside. The tea tasted fine, quite mushroomy obviously and it only started getting nasty when the tea was stone cold :). Anyway, for the first hour there were virtually no effects - maybe some mild perceptual changes, no noticeable nausea. \r\n\r\nAfter about an hour the effects started to become much stronger. Overall was an extremely euphoric feeling, everything was very funny. Combined with this was a lack of coordination and sense of \'losing your mind\'. This wasn\'t worrying though, but seemed really entertaining.\r\n\r\nEventually, about 2 hours after ingestion i guess, the transition from a normal state to the \'mushroom state\' was complete and the \'losing your mind\' sensation had vanished. For the next 2 hours, maybe longer, we had great feelings of empathy with nature. I felt that I could talk to the grass and the trees, who were all very friendly. We walked in to a wooded section of the garden and were a bit concerned to see that some of the plants were \'ill\'. They had holes and suchlike in their leaves, but we were happy to hug and comfort them anyway. I hugged a large tree and felt a huge mutual love between us.\r\n\r\nThese effects lasted for a significant amount of time, it\'s hard to say exactly because time seemed to be going very slowly. The high was followed by a very steady and easy \'come down\'. Everyone was incredibly relaxed and able to talk very easily and openly to one another. \r\n\r\nAfter sitting outside for a while longer we decided to go inside since it was getting dark. Being inside a house was quite daunting at first, although more in a strange than scary way. Sitting inside, I could see trees outside the window and it was these that grabbed my attention for a long time. Gradually the effects of the truffles wore off and there was a slow, comfortable slide back to soberness.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was very pleased with these truffles, the high was very happy and peaceful, a sense of \'oneness\' with nature. These are by far the most mellow and pleasing drugs I\'ve taken. The whole experience was very uplifting and didn\'t leave me tired like many other drugs would have."
12480,Dream Psilocybian (poem),Trippin Tom,Mushrooms - P. mexicana & Panaeolus cyanescens,"\nThe following is a poem about mushrooms written by me while coming down from an intense trip. \r\n\r\n\r\nDream Psilocybian \r\n===================\r\n\r\nWhat man can fathom the dreamy angles psilocybian \r\nThat arise from the earth in sickly-sweet parade\r\nTo make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded? \r\n\r\nElectric is the parade of cascading absurdity \r\nThat claws at the soul with talons of flame\r\nAnd turns things once cherished and familiar \r\nInto gargantuan monoliths of alienation and paranoia \r\nFor beyond the wall of dreams lie dismal fields eternal, and a sun that never rises\r\n\r\nThrough the silent desperation of twilight skies \r\nFrost bitten by undying winds and darkness eternal\r\nAnd shrouded with the depraved laughter of a million madmen\r\nLurks the dream psilocybian\r\nTo make insanity out of reason, and open eyes so long blinded"
4005,Set & Setting Makes the Difference,RaveNation,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\n10:00 PM\r\nI ingested exactly 2 grams of P. Mexicana, which is a fairly potent shroom. After about 20 minutes, I started noticing effects. The initial signs were waves of energy flowing trough my legs gently, as if something telling me that it\x92s gonna be a pretty intense trip. I also noticed some surface breathing and moving. There was also a slight bodily discomfort, especially in my stomach, although far from nausea. I also began feeling a bit nervous, since I\x92d never tried 2 grams before, and I have always had good trips on 1 gram so I didn\x92t exactly know what to expect, only that I was sure I could take it.\r\n\r\n10:30 PM\r\nI now started noticing some visuals, heavy breathing on surfaces, colors got a lot brighter etc. If I closed my eyes at this point, nothing special happened.\r\n\r\n10:40 PM\r\nBy now, I felt a distinct stoning effect, and the bodily discomfort got a bit worse, although it was not that bad. The visuals also began to get a bit trippy.\r\nI was now getting more and more nervous since my last experience with LSD was the first time I experienced loss of reality, and when it happened I got into a panic state and thought I have got a psychosis or something. Really terrible. Anyway, I subconsciously thought that this would happen again, but now on shrooms instead. This only got me more nervous. Really nervous.\r\n\r\n11:00 PM\r\nBy now, the visuals became hallucinations. They also became more intense. I was tripping with two friends who I liked pretty much at the time so they were OK trip partners. Anyway, they had ingested 1.5 grams each, so they didn\x92t have so intense hallucinations as I had, but they were fairly \x93shroomed\x94 too. During this time, we listened to Bob Marley.\r\n\r\n11:15 PM\r\nAs we sat there listening to music, feeling uncomfortable, we decided to go outside for some fresh air. Since there\x92s a park just outside my friend\x92s place, we decided to go there. It was about 17 deg C outside, quite comfortable, although a bit nippy. The shrooms really kicked in when we got to the park. It was now I started loosing reality. It was like; as soon as I started thinking, I experienced reality loss. It was kinda scary because it reminded me of my last LSD trip. As soon as I began talking to my friends, I kind of knew where I was, but when I started thinking to myself, reality disappeared. Spooky.\r\n\r\nSince this happened on and off, I was totally confused, and I didn\x92t enjoy it at all. Anyway, we decided to go inside again, since the coming-up period didn\x92t feel comfortable for any of us.\r\n\r\nWhen we went inside, totally disoriented, Bob Marley was still on, since we hadn\x92t turned off the stereo. As we sat down in the couch, I heard him singing \x93Everything\x92s gonna be allright\x85\x94 and it sounded like he was lying to me, and really meant that I was gonna die or something. As he sang this for awhile, I got really mad at him for singing this bullshit, so I stumbled to the stereo to change the music. I have always hated Bob Marley since then. Anyway, I found a GOA CD somewhere and put in on. As soon as the music started, all nervousness and all bodily discomfort went away like touched from above or something. It felt truly extraordinary. From a state of nervousness and discomfort, to instant bliss. I just said WOW! to my self, thinking: \x93Now I know how set & setting can affect you!!\x94 and stumbled back to the couch, but this time with a big smile on my face. I noticed that my friends also started to enjoy the mushrooms. By now, I knew that it had been at least one hour or so, even longer, but when I looked at my watch it was only 11:35! My perception of time was totally fucked up.\r\n\r\nI now had entered level 4, but in a totally euphoric state. Also, at this point the hallucinations were so intense that I saw the same fucked up twirls and shit everywhere I looked. If my eyes were closed or open at this point didn\x92t make much of a difference. (Dark room.)\r\n\r\nWe talked for awhile but the words seem to dance and echo around in the room before I could hear or see them. At one point, I didn\x92t know if I saw the words or heard them! That has also never happened to me before. Sometimes I couldn\x92t hear at all. I also remember that the music seemed to be coming from somewhere VERY far away. I sat next to the speakers but the sound didn\x92t come from them, I was sure.\r\n\r\n12:00\r\nI now had left the uncomfortable coming-up and entered the peak. Now the intense hallucinations had eased a bit, and I felt that I was one with the hallucinations instead. I had entered the \x91trip\x92. By that I mean that everything I looked at seem so new and beautiful. Everything seemed alien but yet very familiar. Now we decided to go outside again, with intention of going downtown to experience the city in this altered state of mind. At this point, I didn\x92t experience reality loss anymore, because I was so busy looking at the wonderful things I saw. The carpet on the floor, the trees outside etc.\r\nAnyways, we started our walk downtown. Wow, what an amazing walk! We had to stop everywhere, just to smell a flower, lay in the grass, talk to dogs that were out with their masters and much more. Everything was so fun and beautiful! It was truly bliss. As we walked for hours, we finally returned home. When we got to the park near my friend\x92s home, we realized that we were coming down and the peak was gone. We didn\x92t feel bad over this, we just enjoyed everything. We all guessed what the time was, and we guessed that it would be about 4 am, since we had done lots of stuff. We looked at the watch, only 1:45 am! We were amazed.\r\n\r\nWe got inside, sat down and listened to some music, feeling very good about our selves. I felt like I had done a good deed to someone, and that someone was me. I felt so good about my self and thanked god that he had place the mushrooms on this earth for us. I am not a religious person at all, but still, I felt this way.\r\n\r\nI decided to go get something to eat and the others stayed at my friend\x92s house. I returned after about 20 minutes or so, ate my food, talked to my friends, and then we all went to sleep. I fell asleep after only 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nAll I can say about this is: set & setting makes the difference! If I hadn\'t put on that GOA CD, maybe I\'d had a terrible experience!"
132,Webs of Light,Nick,Mushrooms - P. mexicana & MDMA (ecstasy),"\nI\'ve never been one to take things lightly, especially drugs. 1999 was a year of excess. 2000 will be a year to control my consumption. When I wrote to you before, I was only just getting into psychedelics properly. Now I\'ve done my research, done as many entheogens as I thought was safe, know the facts and know what I like. I like P. mexicana. My two favourite types of mushrooms are P. mexicana and P. semilanceata. Why? In my experience they are both more visual than other species I have tried (Thai were good, but not as great as these). My first Mexicana trip blew my head off (almost literally). Now, whenever they are available, I\'ll travel miles to get my hands on them.\r\n\r\nIt was the last weekend before I had to go back to studying. The \'99 - 2000 holidays had been good for me, really good. I hadn\'t gone over the top on the drugs, but I had seen enough and felt enough weird stuff to feel I had come out of the few months I had off having learnt something. If you\'re not familiar with the English schooling system, I am in the Sixth Form, and the most important exams of my school career (A levels) are coming up. They will decide whether or not I get into a good university, so the winter holidays were the last ones I could really let my hair down in before I left school. I woke up quite late on Friday morning deliberately. I had anticipated that my last crazy weekend would be pretty damn crazy, but I decided to make it even crazier. \r\n\r\nI didn\'t eat breakfast or lunch, and after a shower and a cup of tea, got the bag of dried P. mexicana I had bought a couple of days before out of my secret drawer (the one that keeps my mum away from my stashes). It was about 1 PM. Eagerly, I tipped the \'shrooms out onto some newspaper and started examining them. I was very pleased. There were plenty of enormous heads, almost outnumbering the stalks, which for me is very unusual. I estimated I had about 3 grams, since I had bought 5 and given what I thought was 2 to a friend. After deciding that this was a trip to be had on my own (I usually learn more from solo trips), and munched down the dried \'shrooms with a cup of peppermint tea (peppermint tea when you\'re tripping is great, I promise you). The effects came on in about twenty minutes after smoking a pretty pathetic joint I had rolled with some getting-old African Bush Weed bought the week before. However, it did catapult me into the shroom trip. It started with white mists swirling around my body. If I closed my eyes a little, leaving space so that I could still see, the mists got clearer and thicker. They had the consistency and smooth patterns of movement of tobacco smoke, just a lot more elegant. This lasted for about an hour, and I walked around my house watching the weird mists move across my body, occasionally touching me, occasionally going off somewhere else to swirl round something else before returning to me. It was one of the most pleasant feelings I have had on \'shrooms. Unfortunately, apart from the occasional changing wall pattern, or 3D geometric images, that was all the trip really was, and it didn\'t last all that long. I think the fact I had tripped in daylight contributed to the lack of intense visuals, since I had been warned by many a friend that it was not half as good as tripping at night. I was really disappointed. The last two Mexicana trips I had had been really freaky, the last being the weirdest trip I have had so far (Crazy paranoia that everything I touched or ate was spiked with LSD, really intense facial warping on other people, especially friends who were tripping as hard as I was, powerful psychedelic colour visions, feelings of floating across the floor, being totally sure I hadn\'t moved to have got into a completely different room. etc, but that\'s another trip). It was about 5 PM when the \'shrooms stopped completely, and I went downstairs to have a bite to eat. Three hours later, I was off on my way.\r\n             \r\nMyself and four friends had decided to go clubbing that Friday night. I was certainly up for it after the disappointment with the mushrooms, but did feel a little tired. Before I left the house, I made a little tea with some herbal ecstasy I had bought from a mail order company in Amsterdam. It\'s pretty good stuff, but a little too like speed (but with no come-down). Feeling ready to go, and went to meet my friends at an Underground (Subway) station in North London, England, near where I live. We went to a nice dope house-party with some really nice people until around 10 PM, and then went back to the underground station to catch a train down to South London which was were the club we were aiming to go to was situated. First, let me explain what clubbing is for me. It is not about going to a cheesy club, buying cocktails and dancing to hip hop or house. London has an insane underground drug scene, and most of that is made up by crazy heavy shamanic/tribal trance clubs (It is my music, and at the moment I rarely listen to anything else). Behind the false drug security at the doors of these clubs, you can buy anything under the sun, and I really mean that. But, the best thing about this scene is the vibe. It is brilliant. Because there are far more drugs being taken by the shamanic trance crowd than by any other dance culture crowd, every one is so happy and so spaced-out that there are never any problems (and the police don\'t seem to bother, or don\'t notice). Every time you go to one of these clubs you will have made new connections, both with decent dealers who actually do the drugs with you and tell you about what\'s in what they give you, and with like-minded heads like yourself. However, that particular night my friend X****** had organized to pick up what he claimed were going to be particularly good pills. He has pretty good connections, so I believed him, and we went with him to pick up the goods. I bought two, he bought many more, but intended only to take 2 and a half, and the others paid him for one or two depending on how he felt. They were Ferraris, and had the Ferrari symbol clumsily printed on their fronts. In England, the most common pills at the moment are probably Mitsubishis, which have always been good from my experience, but Ferraris are supposed to be much more rushy and much more powerful. I was really looking forward to dropping them. Then, with pills in pockets, and with the herbal ecstasy I had taken completely out of my system, we headed off to Brixton, one of the main points in South London, to find our club.\r\n\r\n There were a number of clubs doing trance, hard acid-house nights, and after queuing up for one that seemed a little too commercial, we headed for one less obvious, but apparently a lot more trippy and more my sort of thing. When we got there, it was pretty much empty, but it was only 11 PM, so we went up to the chill out rooms to relax and drop our first pills. On both the dance floor, bar and chill-out room walls really trippy pictures had been painted with furious psychedelic or fluorescent colours. The lighting set up everywhere, which made heavy use of ultra-violet and other bizarre types of lamp that really made me trip out later on, really made the paintings glow. I knew instantly this place was a bit of an acid den, but I like acid dens, so I decided to relax. My theories were proven correct when I started to talk to the people in the chill-out room. Many of them had come early so that they could take their trips and not be tripping when day broke. The other people sitting around us were either pilling, or doing DMT and other tryptamines. We dropped our Ferraris, bought vast quantities of cigarettes (I know they\'re bad, but they taste so good when you on E!) and water and waited to come up.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, up we came, and boy did we fly. From the first instant we started to feel the Ferraris working, the rushes came hard, fast and intense. The club filled out to almost packed, and we met more and more pilled up or tripped-out people, all of whom were great fun and not at all freak-outs (sometimes you get really f\'d up people who can really mess up your time and freak you out). We danced and chilled continuously until 3 AM, and then, having congregated with ourselves and some new acquaintances in a corner of the chill-out room, we dropped the rest of our Ferraris. I was still rushing hard off my first pill, but thinking ahead, I decided it was a good idea to drop my last pill and smoke a joint before going back to the dance floor. When I came up on my second pill, I was back in the chill out room, and things started to go really weird. I had had visuals on pills before (also after taking \'shrooms), but not to this extent. It had to be the psilocybin in my body. I didn\'t freak out because I knew it was a combination of the lights and my mind that were creating what I saw, but originally it was pretty scary. All the faces of those people around me who were on acid, and only the faces of acid trippers started to grow large, move out and away from their original position. Noses were huge and ugly, skin was flabby and folded and the skin was tinged a horrible green, the colour you would expect in a monster movie. Occasionally I caught a glimpse of what they really looked like, but it took so much concentration and effort to do so that I eventually gave up. Turning away from the warping faces, I noticed other visuals, but these were ones that I had seen before, also on pills, and they are the softest most beautiful visions I have experienced. It is hard to explain, but basically they are webs of green, red and purples that come out from foreheads, walls, basically anything blank and vaguely flat. The best thing about them is the fact that I can catch them with one finger and spin them round it until the web begins to break up and sends tiny different coloured particles of light away into the air until there is nothing left. The bigger they are the better they are, and occasionally and can grab hold of one and actually walk around a room with it. Other familiar things appeared to me, like rows of moving letters, some of which I could identify and others which looked like ancient runes written in mediaeval style. With the addition of the constant rushing that I was getting, increased by any furious dancing I did, this was a perfect trip: not too powerful, very ecstasy orientated and generally really beautiful. I left the club at 6 AM still with some visuals remaining, but I was really tired, really happy, and really glad that my holiday had ended on such a great note.\r\n\r\nlove and respect to the whole worldwide community."
107968,I\'m a Mind Not a Person,Shrek333,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (sclerotia),"\nI had been interested in trying a psychedlic drug for many years, and although I had access to LSD on a few occasions, I decided to wait until I had access to mushrooms. One of my friends, D, was going to buy some off a friend of his, until we relised that they wouldn\'t be ready by the day we had planned to trip. Therefore, we ordered some Sclerotia (truffles) online, as they often get through customs unnoticed. We were going to trip with one other person, J. \r\n\r\nBefore this trip, I had tried alcohol, nitrous oxide and smoked cannabis about once a week. I was very open to the idea of tripping so I felt I could handle a decent sized dose, although I didn\'t want to overdo it. I read a lot of reports for mushrooms, but finding information on Sclerotia, particularly dosage, was difficult. We decided that J and I would take 7g each, and D would take 9, as he took SSRIs for depression, which supposedly decrease the effects of psilocybin. To prepare for the trip, I abstained from all drugs for a week, ate very healthily, meditated, and did not enjoy any sexual pleasure for two days before the trip. There was some anxiety during the week, as the truffles were ordered only the week before the day we planned to take them, so it was unknown if they would arrive on time. Thankfully, they arrived the morning of the trip.\r\n\r\nWe met at 12.00 on the day of trip. It was a Saturday, the first weekend of a week school holiday. We walked to a near park and munched on the truffles at 12.30, holding them in our mouths for a few minutes with orange juice. We were all very excited and in a good mindset. \r\n\r\nWe then walked to a woods, about a 15 minute walk from the park. About halfway there, we all said we felt something, almost the same as having a puff on a joint, or a beer. By the time we got to the woods, we all felt slightly drunken, and my body was getting quite heavy which made it difficult to walk. \r\n\r\nWe planned to set up a base at a particular place in the woods, a 20 minute walk from the entrance. Walking started to become extremely laborious; it felt as if someone had literally tied weights to my body, although mentally, I had lots of energy. We all began laughing and smiling contently for no reason. We stopped at some places, noticing that colours had become brighter, and everything in nature looked exceptionally beautiful. I started having a conversation with D about plants while J stared at ripples in a pond and took some pictures. Looking down at the ground, I noticed it looked odd. I took a closer look, and it started subtly moving, warping. This was something I could achieve while sober, but never this quickly. D and J could both see it too. This made us very excited.\r\n\r\nWe walked further and the colours of the forest became intensely saturated, far more so than on cannabis. Purples and greens especially stood out. The journey seemed like a manifestation of the trip, and that when we reached our destination, we would be at our peaks. J said that when looking at the ground, everything almost seemed to trail backwards, as if smudged by a paintbrush. \r\n\r\nWe finally reached our destination at 2.00. I was very relieved at this point. Having time to appreciate the trip, we stared at various things for a few minutes, watching them twist and warp and change size, and explaining to each other what we saw and felt. Over the next few hours, we just talked. About nature, society and how people think. We all shared a similar mindset: a detachment from modern society and the unnatural, injust and immoral things in life. We all commented that our sense of identity as people was greatly diminished, which led to the phrase; \'I\'m a mind, not a person\'. We recorded these \'quotes\' in a diary I brought with me. We all felt a great sense of contentment and fulfillment, as well as apathy towards anything unimportant. I also had a slightly uneasy stomach and no appetite, but it didn\'t bother me. I ate something just to experience the taste, and it felt great in my mouth, but it felt odd that I was ingesting food, almost as if my own body wasn\'t a part of me.\r\n\r\nJ and I then ate about 0.5 grams extra which we brought just in case, as we thought we could easily handle it.\r\n\r\nI decided I wanted to make use of the headphones I brought with me, and proceeded to listen to a piece of music I had written. I shut my eyes and buried my head in my lap. I saw various faint shapes, including impossibly tessalated triangles, as well as symbolic looking eyes which were all moving and warping. Although I considered some of the images scary, I found them very interesting and there was never a moment of real fear. After opening my eyes, my vision was flashing like a strobe light. This persisted for a few seconds. \r\n\r\nD came over with tears streaming down his face. I asked if he was ok. He replied, he felt so content with life, that he was crying tears of joy. I felt very happy for him. Both D and J used my headphones and experienced their own CEVs. \r\n\r\nIt started to rain around 4.00 so we packed up and walked to J\'s house, while listening to music. We were still tripping, and my grey coat looked like it was blue. I was aware I was cold, but it was just a sensation, not unpleasant at all. \r\n\r\nAfter arriving at J\'s, D decided to go home, because he was sober. J and I were not, and the walls were still moving when I looked at them. J and I then played xbox until about 8.00. I was tired, but sober by this point. \r\n\r\nAll in all, it was great experience. We all noticed instances where a bad trip could ensue, but no negative feelings were ever felt. We all felt we could handle a stronger trip, but that this was a great introduction to the psychedelic world."
44894,Two Personalities,the only girl,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nFirst of all... Sorry my english!\r\n\r\nYesterday (22 july) me and two friends of mine ate mexican shrooms. I started with 2,5g since it was my first time, and the other started with 5 gram. It didnt take many minutes until I started to feel a little weird. I smiled alot, and laughed a little.\r\n\r\nI waited 85 minutes, then ate 2 grams more. And then things started to get really weird! And I noticed all the feelings in my body. And in the same way I didnt feel that I even had a body. I started to dance, and laughed. Then suddenly I lay down, and felt I went on a journey. I just listened to the music and travelled far away while I was looking at a pretty weird ceiling. Screaming faces, waves, It all started to get... \'wow this is too much\' So I thought maybe it would help if I stand up. But then I noticed that it wasnt only the ceiling that was weird, everything was weird! My hands were longer and thinner, and I couldnt understand which angle the room was in. I couldnt understand where I was. Kinda scary, but I liked it. And the faces on my friends were getting bigger. Sometimes I even felt like I had two personalities. Like the good Gollum and the Bad Gollum in The Lord of the rings.\r\n \r\nAfter a while I could \'handle\' it. It wasnt that scary anymore and then I was just sitting and holding hands with one of my friends. I felt I could feel what he felt. Skin and veins was so fascinating. Everything was beautiful! Then suddenly my other friend started to have a bad trip. So then I got serious, and all I could think about was to get my friend up from hell and try to make him happy again. But I couldnt do it. I felt what he felt...and it was too much for me, I started almost on a bad trip myself so I just had to get away and relax. So my other friend could \'fix\' this. \r\n\r\nOne more thing I remember is that since I was the only girl there, I felt very housewife/mother-ish. I felt like I had to take care of these boys...My friends. Like they were my kids.\r\nWhen I think back I think I had a great time..\r\nIt was extreme! But I will definitely try it again.."
11435,Hello...I Like to Party...,egodeath,Mushrooms & Cannabis,"\n(sorry for my bad english)\r\n\r\nMy day was just fine, I got alot of work done in the office. Good overall feeling, the sun was shining though it was really cold (21st December), Christmas just a few days ahead. Going to a friend, cause we planned to trip on shrooms some time ago.\n\r\nSo lets get it as short as possible...-->\r\n\r\nThe setting couldnt be better - we listen to goa with another guy and a girl. Almost constantly smoking joints. The room isnt too big, very comfortable. Colorful lights around the turntables - Christmas tree wire. I\'ll call the main dj Shiva, the girl Kali and the other friend Raiden (cause he looked like this god later). Experienced shroomers, except me.\r\n\r\nI came up with the idea to make shroom-tea, 2 grams for everyone. So thats 8-9 grams dried shrooms in a little bowl. We cut the shrooms into small pieces and cooked it for 15 minutes, then mixing it with herbal tea. We didnt cook separately... Tasted nice. Goes down like a fine tea. Shiva and Kali enjoyed it with honey. The bottom of my cup was tasting really shroomy.\r\n\r\nAbout 20 minutes later everything seemed fine. It was just the next minute that came at a pulsing shocking speed. I tripped about 8 times before but this time it was COMPLETELY different. I tripped about 8 times before but this time it was COMPLETELY different. My body felt good but my brain was glowing with a fluorescing light. I closed my eyes - nothing special. I opened them again - my friends were not sitting in the order they sat before. Ok...\r\n\r\nI realized that the room was VERY small right now. Everything was in the wrong place. It morphed and shifted into a big room, a long room and a deep room. Looking at my friends. Oh my God! Whats going on? Shiva had 6 eyes, sometimes a completely deformed head small and big. Insectoid spidery body. It looked scary. Raiden was different, he looked like an old god with long white hair and a long slightly bigger face. Kali was alright - she looked naturally and good. There was nothing morphed or deformed. So every person looked different.\r\n\r\nI couldnt believe it, I was dreaming, it felt like a dream and it was impossible real. Too much distortion. I got angry cause my friends were not tripping THAT hard. They were still talking and doing things on the computer. It was clear - THIS was a real trip, I did shrooms before, but not really. Thats what everyone was talking about when going on shrooms. But how did my friends manage to do things relaxed? I will never do shrooms again, thats too hard. My trips before were a joke. THIS was the real thing.\r\n\r\nMy time for fleeing - I wasnt prepared for that. I tryed to get away. NOW or never I said to myself. Every second was counting. I told my friends that I planned to leave. I wanted to lay down on my bed alone in darkness. Pretending I have to work tomorrow and wanting to go sleep. So everyone got really angry on me. I couldnt help myself. I didnt want or better wasnt able to describe what I saw. So scary. The room rotated and morphed along. I wasnt able to find the exit. So my friends didnt know exactly whats going on with me. Raiden asked me if I was able to surf it. No way....no control. I layed down. I knew it would change my life. Everyone was angry, me too. They will go tell everyone. Ruin my life totally. So I lost my 3 friends. And my life. Irrepairable. I resisted. They insisted.\r\n\r\nWhile lying down I had NO closed eye visuals - for a long time. My brain turned liquid in a matter of seconds. The juice was pumped down into my veins. No brain in my head. Only blood. My head was full of thick dark red blood. I didnt have any energy rushes or electricity. But it was really painful...believe me.\r\n\r\nLost perception of time. Was it a minute or an hour? I couldnt tell. Time stretched enormous. A minute REALLY took an hour. Unbelievable. Opening my eyes was scary, the room wasnt a room anymore. The was no space. No air. The walls and just everything was right in front of my eyes. Nothing in between. Pulsing warping. Beyond plastic. Everything flat before is warping into a full body, textures went 3d-fractal.\r\n\r\nStrong Synesthesia - Feeling impossible words, seeing my feelings and thoughts, touching my vision and feelings.\r\n\r\nBreathing was very hard. I catched a cold little more than one week before and still had slight problems. Shiva and Raiden gave me instructions cause I forgot to breathe at all some times. I concentrated on 3 things: breathing, checking pulse, staying awake. I concentrated on 3 things: breathing, checking pulse, staying awake.\r\n\r\nMy mind rotated into a spiral like tunnel. Enjoyed that. Insanity - I was flopping between worlds and different mindstates never felt before. Totally freaking out. There was no going back - ever. I was sure I would have countless disabilities after this trip. I may never get back to reality. Stuck in an ever changing deforming body with complete insanity. No more control. Connected to all worlds and dimensions of all time with one fucked up body. I wouldnt cry, never. I was prepared for death. Maybe living in a nerve clinic.\r\n\r\nLife was just a space trap. We have to move on to the next consciousness. Life has lasted only 1 second before, I am right now warping into the next dimension. Looking quickly, opening my eyes. Hyperspace jumping. Very interesting feeling.\r\n\r\nThere was no body any longer and no world surrounding me. My thoughts were a huge crystal - it shattered. I was a infinite wave of small crystals. No feelings or thoughts.\r\n\r\nMy heart beats slowly. Seeing one frame per heartbeat. Reading my life in a book carefully. Fluck-----fluck-----fluck-----fluck...endless.\r\n\r\nShiva said...I am poisoned really strong. Indicating they would let me die. I am not going to tell them I was dying. Unsure of anything. They shut off the music. Opened the window. Looked at me. It was cold. White. Like in the morning, I didnt know the time. I think I was looking really weird. Ashamed. Shiva gave me a glass of water. Nice. They wouldnt let me die.\r\n\r\nI layed down again. Powerful energy rushing through my body. After 30 minutes (2 hours under my perception) a sudden hit. Back to reality. Feeling enourmosly good, after this disastrous ride! Man...I was SO happy. Unbelievable. My own thoughts again. I was living. Everything before was an illusion. Smiling endlessly. Still unable to talk. I was able to deform everything with my thoughts. The room was full with colorful stripes, still not much space.\r\n\r\nWhats next? Whats next? Whats Next!? Whats next? Whats next? Ok I am going to...Whats next? SO happy...whats next? What should I do next? I am reborn...so what should I do now? Whats next? I am reborn...so what should I do now? Whats next? It looped for about 30 minutes. What if...\r\n\r\nSeemed really long. Raiden left. I was almost unable to talk to him or say goodbye.\r\n\r\nShiva referred to a buddha state. Kali, Shiva and me sat there listening to music and smoking a joint. Very cool. I was relaxed and feeling immortal strength.\r\n\r\nI remembered Kali saying in the past: When u accept the permanent state of something bad and it turns out to get even better than before, its overwhelming. True.\r\n\r\nI didnt stay much longer. Driving home in a taxi. Clear thoughts. Wise and powerful. Able to change my surrounding world in a blink.\r\n\r\nBack at home. 5:15 in the morning! Thought it was 11 or 12. Time for music and a joint. I was dancing like 2 hours! Celebrating EVERYTHING. Life looked and felt shiny. Though some alien thoughts were still there...\r\n\r\nBathing was almost too relaxing. So I went to sleep soon.\r\n\r\nJust a memory next day. I\'ve survived. Lucky me.\r\n\r\nIt sounded scary but I enjoyed about 65 percent of this trip. I like my horror thoughts. I know how it feels now, no one can - who wasnt there. I saw alot. Touched everything. <!-- I guess u dont want to know what I heard............-->"
99225,Stoned Longer Than Wanted,st51,"Mushrooms - P. mexicana, Cannabis, Venlafaxine & Mirtazapine","\nDecided to try psilocybin for the first time and got 10 g of p. mexicana spores. The trip was very mellow, pleasurable, and intensified the positive effects of cannabis. The negative surprise was that cognitive aftereffects persisted for up to to T+10 (!) days cognitive aftereffects persisted for up to to T+10 (!) days. Probably both the mild trip and the long aftereffects were due to interactions with SSRI/SNRI medications. Possibly some kind of neurotransmitter response to the psilocybin?\r\n\r\nSet and setting: alone, in calm hotel room with 48 hours to spare, prepared peaceful environment with meditation and music. (and pen and paper for notes)\r\n\r\nDay 1\r\n\r\nT: ate 5 g of p. mexicana spores\r\nT+ 15 mins: slight dizziness\r\nT+ 20 mins: mind drifting, free association changed.\r\nT+ 45 mins: daydreaming, music background sounds wider\r\nT + 50 mins: ate remaining 5 g of mushrooms\r\nT + 1h40: short-term memory lapses\r\nT + 1h55: watching comedy shows--they seem much more fun than usual\r\nT + 3h: significantly milder effects than I expected.

Smoke strong joint. This sends me into a very spiritual mode. Deep derealization. Thinking that all of the life on the surface of this ball of rock is just bubbling mud reaching out for sunlight. \r\n Feel like I see and feel mu (a zen koan thing) in 3D. Thinking: this is it. There\'s mu. This is enlightenment. None of this matters, and it\'s all quite funny really: We live on a ball suspended in emptiness.\r\n\r\nCouple of hours after that: less clear, more foggy mind. Afternoon is pleasurable but hazy. Music, food, humor, sex seem much intensified. Smoke joint in the evening.\r\n\r\nDay 3\r\n\r\nLast strong joint at around noon (it\'s Sunday). More body high, less philosophical than day before. Very relaxed.\r\n\r\nDay 4\r\n\r\nMonday morning. Negative surprise: I still feel quite stoned. This has never happened on cannabis only. Memory lapses, extreme difficulty concentrating. Certainly cannot drive or operate machinery. Feeling very weird and anxious at work. Feel it must be obvious that I am in an altered state. Yet none of the people I interact with, who know me very well, seem to notice anything. Ego boundaries very weak: anything people say affects me much to an almost unbearable extent.\r\n\r\nDays 5-7\r\n\r\nQuite similar to day 4. Almost no change. Clearly altered state to me, nobody else seems to notice anything, concentration very poor, senses heightened. Not a displeasurable state at all. Very mellow and relaxed, medium stoned. If could just relax and be by myself no problem at all. But work and other responsibilities causing anxiety. Also, occasionally worried is this permanent? Researching serotonin receptors and wondering if long-term effect is due to SSRI/SNRI medication. The psilocybin and THC must be long clear of my system, so probably must be an endogenous neurotransmitter response to the psilocybin shock. Wondering how long this is going to last. On day 6, halve the mirtazapine to 15 mg just in case this is excess serotonin.\r\n\r\nDay 8\r\n\r\nIn the evening, finally starting to feel normal! Relieved--it\'s not permanent. In the evening, finally starting to feel normal! Relieved--it\'s not permanent. Then remember that normal is not that pleasant, anxious and depressed. The long altered state was good by itself, just anxiety-provoking in combination with day-to-day responsibilities.\r\n\r\nDays 9-10\r\n\r\nFeeling almost normal. Still slight loss of concentration and heightened senses.\r\n\r\nOverall:\r\n\r\nPsilocybin with SSRIs/SNRIs caused a relatively mild altered state with no hallucinations. Cannabis effects were clearly intensified, with strong spiritual states that persist in normal modes of consciousness. Experienced significant anxiety when stoned sensation continued for almost a week. Will not try psilocybin again at least while on antidepressants due to unpredictable long-term response. For me, just cannabis seems to have a more predictable and time-contained effect."
110216,Realized I Had a Predilection for Amazonian Strains,Azure,"Mushrooms - P. cubensis, P. mexicana & P. zapotecorum","\nExperiential Notes on Psilocybe Species\r\n\r\nAs pertains to the qualitative differences between Psilocybe cubensis and the more traditional species of Psilocybe \r\n\r\n[In] Huautla de Jimenez, Mexico <!--P. cubensis is the only mushroom referred to exclusively by its Spanish--versus Mazatec, name \'San Isidro\'; P. cubensis came with the Spanish and their cattle, and is widely considered the least desirable of the species. The patron saint of labor, farming and livestock, San Isidro is emblematic of the invaders and livestock-culture. Contrary to Wasson\'s suggestion that the term \'derrumbe\' is exclusive to P. caerulescens, -->I heard the term derrumbe applied to both P. caerulescens and P. zapotecorum. From what I gathered, the \'derrumbe\' mushrooms were largely considered the most coveted and desirable, owing to their fuerza/force. P. zapotecorum seemed generally to be the most coveted species; they are very strong, quite vivid in the visions, my initial impression was that of friendliness, but they are very serious and powerful. The clearest vision that stands out from my initial experience with the P. zapotecorum was of seeing highly detailed psychocosmic roses pouring off the altar; it was quite striking, vivid and beautiful. It\'s a mexican and indigenous mushroom through and through. I think some of the difference is apparent in the respective terminologies for los derrumbes and los pajaritos; the P. mexicana has more of an ethereal character that seems to evoke interstellar and deep-space vistas. My first time eating the \'Chicon Nindo\' variety of P. mexicana--which I brought back from Mexico with me, when I closed my eyes I saw the outline of a cosmic horizon cast in subtle blues. It appeared to be some manner of astral star-city with a new Jerusalem theme, the streets were quiet and there was an aura of deep calm about the scenario. The P. zapotecorum--by contrast, was more chthonic and perhaps iconically \'shamanic.\'\r\n\r\nThere are reasonably solid and good strains of P. cubensis<!--, people seem to develop a preference for this or that strain grown in this or that way-->. I spontaneously and unwittingly became partial to strains of P. cubensis that were mostly sourced from the Amazon; after sourcing my preferred P. cubensis genetics, I realized I had a predilection for Amazonian strains. I suppose on a certain level P. cubensis is a \'universal\' mushroom, and convenient. Once basic adjustments are made to technique, P. mexicana is just about as easy to grow though it can take a bit more in the way of patience. They require more air-flow while maintaining high humidity, and seem to benefit greatly from supplemental blue LED light in the ~452nm wavelength range. The blue-LED light has been observed to stabilize and normalize their development and morphology in the fruiting-phase. The onset and quality of the experience with P. mexicana is somehow more \'classical\' to what I consider to be the psilocybin-state. One of the major differences is in onset, where P. cubensis can elicit an uncomfortable rush of patterned and somewhat forceful-viral-alienesque visions, P. mexicana elicits more of a spacious, calm and welcoming openness. I have uniformly experienced P. mexicana to be calm, spacious, open, relaxed and deep where P. cubensis can become unusually dark or forceful. I have uniformly experienced P. mexicana to be calm, spacious, open, relaxed and deep where P. cubensis can become unusually dark or forceful. Between the two, I\'m definitely settled on P. mexicana in so far as providing a positive and beneficial experience. \r\n\r\nI have a lot of the younger generation asking questions about the optimal approach to psilocybin mushrooms. In terms of providing guidance and direction to others, I have what I feel is an ethical responsibility to guide people towards P. mexicana, which I have consistently found does in fact provide a more beneficient, calm and peaceful experience more conducive to the sorts of mystical experience observed in the Johns Hopkins Griffiths study."
82956,No Real Trip Happening at All,steelcogito,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nWell this was my first experience with these particular mushrooms and using the Sclerotia portion of the mushroom. I was very excited as it had been a while and finding and opportunity to get back in touch with part of my consciousness I had been neglecting as my life passes by. So needless to say I had great anticipation for a needed trip and based on my fond memories of others I could not wait to get back. \r\n\r\nDetails: About two hours after breakfast I took ten grams and ran them through a garlic press as recommended and mixed them with a cup of Yerba Mate tea, drank and ate the pieces at the bottom and waited, and waited, and waited. After an hour with little or no effects I became a bit disappointed. After about another 40 minutes I did another ten grams in the same manner and waited, and waited and waited again nothing really some very mild feelings with no real trip happening at all.\r\n\r\nConclusion: very disappointed with these and still in need of my visit, if 20 grams could not do  it then I am very curious as to how much I would need to eat of these to bring the desired result. As Terence said the danger was not taking too much but taking too little, in this case not sure how much is right."
110219,Dressed as an Aztec Priest,Seor,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nUnusual Psilocybe Mexicana Experience\r\n\r\nI obtained 5 dried grams of mushrooms from a guy I\'d got some off previously. I decided to ingest 5 grams on this occasion because I did 3 grams last time, I had a very good experience, but thought it would be interesting to increase the dose and push the boat out a little. When I acquired the shrooms, I didn\'t ask what kind of they were, I assumed they were the same as the ones I got before (Psilocybe cubensis).\r\n\r\nAfter ingesting the mushrooms, as the intensity of experience slowly increased, I noticed something strange and distinct compared to my previous mushroom journeys...patterns, geometrical shapes of a kind I had never seen before. I recognized them as being Aztec-like. I saw Aztec gods, giving me knowledge, telling me secrets, leading me through some kind of ancient places, they told me how this life is a test, which we must pass. I saw their buildings, it was very realistic, everything. I saw one temple, and on the top of it, there was some bright golden light with was radiating the most beautiful light ever, radiating light and love. I encountered some kind of jaguar people, which were very friendly and loving. I relived the experiences and memories of Aztec people. On one occasion, when my sitter asked me if I was alright, I looked at him, and clearly saw him dressed as an Aztec priest. Interestingly, afterwards I read an account of the late, great Dr Albert Hofmann who ingested 3.2g of dried lab grown P. mexicana mushrooms to bioassay them for psychoactivity, and he reported exactly the same thing! \'When the doctor supervising the experiment bent over to check my blood pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest, and I would not have been astonished had he drawn an obsidian knife.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the experience ended, I was in complete awe and disbelief. Shortly after I almost completely came down, I phoned that guy to ask him what kind of shrooms these were, because I had never had an experience like that. When he told me those were Psilocybe mexicana, I just hang up, without saying a word. I was in greatest shock and amazement since my very birth.\r\n\r\nI broke down in tears afterwards due to the power and profundity of what I had experienced; words can\'t even touch what I experienced."
31535,Make Sure You Feel Safe,kitkat,Mushrooms - P. mexicana (truffles),"\nThis was the third time I\'ve done psychedelics but I only ever take very low doses.  I was with friends and we had a great time at first, laughing loads.  Then we went to a club and I found that the environment was really affecting me - if the music was something I liked, I felt great, but if it was unfamiliar, I felt very confused and disjointed.  Likewise, seeing people who seemed different from me (dressed different, significantly older or younger etc) made me feel confused and like I didn\'t understand what was going on.  On my way home with my boyfriend, a car that had stopped for us at a pedestrian crossing suddenly revved and accelerated towards us for a \'joke\', to scare us - this freaked me out big time and I was suddenly intensely scared.  My boyfriend kept asking what I was scared of, but it was nothing, or rather everything: just a sense of fear and vulnerability.  I desperately needed to feel safe, be in a familiar place with people I trusted, so I would recommend to anyone doing drugs like this that you do so.  Anything negative or threatening seems to be perceived more strongly, as if the normal defences that you have in your everyday life are stripped away."

5606,It Felt Like a Dream,D. Nelson,Mushrooms - P. mexicana,"\nI recently went to Amsterdam with the sole intention of getting mashed. On the first day, me and my five friends went to a smartshop and brought a bag each of mexican cubensis mushrooms. We all decided because we were all tired from having no sleep in 48 hours,that we would do them another day. \r\n\r\nHowever after I had been smoking weed from ten in the morning, I was very stoned and we were in are room, and most people had fallen asleep. The only people still awake was me and my friend Pete. I had never taken mushrooms before, so I opened the  packet to have look at them. As soon as I looked at them I put the two mushrooms in my mouth and chewed them and swallowed them.\r\n\r\nIt was about 40 minutes later and I started to make a spliff, as I was crumbling the weed into the papers, I noticed that I had started feeling really strange. It seemed like it took ages to roll the spliff, and once it was rolled, everything felt weird. I was trying to explain to Pete what was going on in my head, but I was making no sense. I began smoking the spliff I rolled, it had about five different weeds in and no tobbaco. Every time I had a toke and blew the smoke out. An amazing feeling swept across my brain, it felt like pure holiness sweeping across my brain.\r\n\r\nAfter smoking half the spiff I had completely come up. The curtains covering the wall were moving like the sea, i was staring at them for ages, and stared thinking about the buzz. I kept thinking that the mushrooms were controlling me, because all I was, was an animal, and that they thought I was no better or worse than any other creature on the planet. Every muscle in my body felt completely relaxed, I could feel the buzz in my head flowing around my body. I looked behind and I was shocked to see all my friends in bed, because it felt like everything I was seeing was the whole universe. As I forgot that they even existed. \r\n\r\nAfter about 3 hours tripping I went to bed, but I could not sleep it felt like my brain was too powerful. I was laying down with my eyes closed, and pete was doing bongs, the souud of the water bubbling, sounded almost painfully loud, and every noise pete was making also sounded amplified. I stated shouting to myself with every noise pete made until i opened my eyes.\r\n\r\nIt felt like a dream, I was feeling the things around me, but I could not actually feel them, it felt like they were not there. I was very disorientated at this point. So tried getting back to sleep. I was lying down and I had loads of energy, so much that until I fell asleep, I was constantly twitching all over my body.\r\n\r\nThat night felt like the best of my life and I can not wait to do them again."
