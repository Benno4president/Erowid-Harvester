111315,A Trip Spent Walking and Police Escorting,seebueb,Mushrooms - P cubensis,"\nA Trip Spent Walking and Police Escorting.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to share this experience that was quite different from the previous ones. I am usually very reluctant interacting with sober people when I\x92m tripping and like to stay in close proximity to a safe spot. This time however, I walked far away from my tripping base and did that on a busy hiking trail full of sober hikers. Strangely, these hikers helped me to have one of the most insightful, philosophical trips I ever had.\r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\nI am a male in my mid-forties, not married, no kids, am living in Europe and am somewhat, but not overly, experienced with psychedelics (mushrooms, salvia, LSD, 2C-somethings, MDMA, BZP - approx. 50 trips within the last 20 years & smoke weed on a daily basis). Mushrooms have always been my favorite substance. I tripped on very high doses in the past, experienced pure bliss and had to weather-out demanding, believe-shattering journeys. Three years ago, I quit my quite demanding job as an aeronautics engineer in order to study full time at the philosophical faculty. \r\n\r\nSet: First week of semester after an exhaustive term break where I worked long hours for two months. A little bit insecure, but relaxed.\r\nSetting: Beautiful little cottage very close to a lake, surrounded by marshland. Mid-September.\r\nDosage: 3.5 g psilocybe cubensis, mixed strains (McKenna; Mazatapec; PES Hawaii) \r\n\r\nPreface\r\nMy ex-girlfriend and me rented the cottage some months ago. It is almost always booked so we rented it, regardless that the lectures started in this very week. Unfortunately, we split a month or so before the rental, so I ended up being there on my own. It is a rather small and simple bungalow, beautifully located directly at the border of a lake, surrounded by marshland,  heated by a wood stove, and the next public transportation is approximately 3 km (2 miles) away. Not having a car, this was somewhat inconvenient for getting there and from university, but great for privacy, especially during the night (for there\x92s a popular hiking trail right behind the bungalow, only shielded-off by a hedge). There is another cottage of a similar type close by, approximately 70 meters away, both patios are in sight of each other.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday I moved in and enjoyed the solitude very much as a contrast to the never ending noise and hustle of the city center where I live. I planned to trip on shrooms during my stay already at the time of renting the cottage, and cherished the freedom of just having time to decide when. Some three years ago, I had started cultivating mushrooms and developed my own variation of straw-coffee ground-technique Some three years ago, I had started cultivating mushrooms and developed my own variation of straw-coffee ground-technique that is simple and works surprisingly well. It turned into a nice hobby but eventually, I had to stop because there were simply way too much shrooms to be consumed (without fearing to lose one\x92s marbles) and I did not want to sell it. I thought that I may give it a shot right on arrival but then the people in the neighboring house were having some kind of family gathering, there were people coming and going and greeting each other enthusiastically, which bothered me slightly, so I thought I may wait for after the weekend for tripping. \r\n\r\nThe Day\r\nSo I waited till Thursday. The night before, I had a friend over. We had a great night with deep talks, laughter and reflection. She had to go to work early and drove me to the next gas station where I got some orange juice and sweets, just in case I wanted some treats during my journey. After a walking back to the cottage, I smoked a joint and slept for another five hours or so. It was a gorgeous day, end of September, two full days without any commitments - it felt right to trip. \r\n\r\n+ 0:00 (12:20) / + 3.5g psilocybe cubensis; + 1 Joint\r\nI weighed out 3.5 g of psilocybe cubensis. I formulated three issues I wanted to explore during the trip (1. decision-making in general; 2. how to deal with my ex-girlfriend; how to deal with the huge expected work-load at university). I chewed the shrooms, washed them down with orange juice and smoked another joint to ease the come-up. I considered it to be a rather low dose since they just laid around for more than two years, one year of it exposed to light. It turned out, the weakened potency was no issue at all. \r\n\r\n+ 0:30 (12:50) \x96 First Signs\r\nAfter some thirty minutes, I felt the first, steadily increasing effects. One of the harshest come-ups in my tripping career so far. I couldn\x92t get comfortable regardless what I tried, was freezing and sweating at the same time but surprisingly, there was almost no anxiety. At least for this first phase. I laid in my bed and masturbated twice (sorry for being so explicit) and with each orgasm, the beginning trip changed its \x93shade\x94, making me believe that the very uncomfortable come-up phase was finally over. \r\n\r\n+ 1:00 (13:20) \x96 A Rough Come-Up\r\nBut the uneasiness kept increasing up to a point where I had to get out of bed. I just felt down, it felt like there was neither a place nor a destiny for me in this world. I started pacing back and forth through the three rooms of cabin (a good procedure for difficult times on psychedelics) and without realizing it for some time, I got into a strange thought loop. The thing with this though loop was that not only the same sequence of thoughts repeated (well, its a loop) with every pacing-through-the-cabin round, but the emotions increased with every cycle too. They were not necessarily bad, but heavy, serious and a little dark. I eventually called it \x93panic loop\x94, not because it was a loop of panic, but I believed that this was the mechanism to how people get anxiety or panic attacks. Having the same emotionally-loaded thoughts over and over again and each cycle starts from a higher level of emotions because the previous one added some. Not the best thought when tripping. However, this pattern kept coming and going during the whole trip. I longed to go outside and sit by the lake, for the weather was great but my neighbors were sitting outside with some friends. I had no wish that they see me in this state, being sweaty, agitated and clearly not in a mentally healthy state. So I kept wandering around inside the cabin until I realized that I needed to leave the house to get out of the loop and decided to walk on the busy trail \x96 if only for a few minutes. It took me another fifteen minutes to get my trousers on because ironically, the plan to escape the loop had become a part of the \x93panic loop\x94 itself. I kept forgetting that I needed my pants in the middle room and remembered it again every time I reached the adjacent room where my trousers were. This entire pacing phase lasted for about an hour.\r\n\r\n+ 2:00 (14:20) \x96 Crossroad to the Psychedelic World\r\nI finally managed to concentrate long enough to grab my pants and get them on. As I sat down to put the shoes on, out of nothing, the walls bulged immensely and got a strange translucent green-red visual echo like having a bad reception on an old color tv. Now I was anxious! I just couldn\x92t believe how strong the mushroom was coming on and feared that I may be in for a very intensive, maybe too intensive trip with no place to feel comfortable. I pushed that thought away, with it (surprisingly) went the visuals and I stumbled out on the trail. From now on, I may not get the sequence of the events in the exact order, but in general it fits.\r\n\r\nWhile I was walking, the anxiety vanished almost immediately. But it was replaced by self-accusations. I thought how stupid I am to still be doing mushrooms. I asked myself what I want from the mushroom what he has not shown me already and it is on me to act accordingly instead of being lazy and keeping asking him again. I remembered somebody quoting Alan Watts that one shall hang up when having received the call from psychedelics. I thought that I am having a weak psyche and I need my mental strength to keep my things together (strangely, I was thinking this in English) when I\x92m sober, so using psychedelics is just dumb. Not that I was scared to loose or damage my mind, I just felt way too exhausted for a heavy trip full of wonder and confusion. \r\n\r\nJust as I was crossing a small bridge, a colorful completely psychedelic world unfolded in front of my inner eye, ready to take me over. I didn\x92t hallucinate. It was like a dream-picture was superimposed on (the left side of) my regular \x93view\x94 or the image that is processed in the brain. It was a Kokopelli-like figure, playing silently some kind of flute while dancing in a bouncing, off-beat psytrance style in a world of dark green and dark red pattern that reminded me remotely of scallop shells (one side a smooth round contour, the other jagged). It felt like a yielding path, to be travelled on one\x92s own discretion. I honestly and boldly refused the idea to go to the psychedelic world and dissolve and I was very relieved, almost excited that I was offered the chance to decide.\r\n\r\n+ 2:10 (14:30) \x96 The Philosophical Walk\r\nAnd I was right, the psychedelic world retreated and within the next hour or so, I slowly came to terms with my trip. This was the trip to end all trips, at least for me. The last trip and I should humbly experience it and reflect about it while doing so, like somebody who had just had his last day at work before retirement and closes-off the door for good. Thoughts raced through my mind, each one formed new, unexpected connections with another one and with itself. It was not a thinking process, they connected by themselves at an incredible speed. And it seemed each thought was accompanied, yet somehow merged with an adequate emotion. I believed/knew it was my duty to go through all emotions and to bring the thoughts into the world of human knowledge. To formulate, to apply concepts on the connections and dependencies that unfolded themselves. For the sake of just having them thought, for entering them in a morphic field. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the trail had become quite busy, there was a group of people, let\x92s say, every 5 minutes. Mostly retired couples or young mothers with their kids, all friendly, caring for each other and in good spirits. Usually, I try to avoid other people as much as I can while tripping. But this time, all the friendly faces and loving vibes and the fact that I had to greet them somehow kept me on the right track, literally. Time stretched unbelievably. I know this trail very well and couldn\x92t believe that I only covered a bend of maybe 10 m (30 feet) while I went through what felt like a dozen thoughts and mood swings. The trip was still gaining momentum and for a brief moment, I feared that I may be overwhelmed, not be able to move and make a fool of myself. But somehow, I knew that everything was going to be o.k. when I just kept walking and fulfilling my duty. I was still walking on that sunny, busy trail. From time to time I was sucked into the \x93panic loops\x94. But I was able to draw myself out of it, thanks to the friendly hikers (thank you!). One of the \x93panic loops\x94 was actually very inspiring and gave the trip a new turn.\r\n\r\nThe thought loop revolved around second thoughts about walking away so far away from my safe spot and a slight fear of sliding into a bad trip, asking myself what a bad trip is and what it is caused by. I concluded that it could only be one\x92s mind or one\x92s self that makes a trip bad and I was scared to spend the next few hours under the regime of my own self, realizing that this is pretty fucked-up, yet dangerous fear, for we can never escape ourselves (nor should we!). I then asked myself whether it was a good idea to walk so far... and the loop started again, but with more intensity and speed. As soon as I realized that I\x92m in a loop again, I left it with ease. But the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me \x93me\x94 stuck and became the main theme of the trip. the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me \x93me\x94 stuck and became the main theme of the trip.\r\n\r\nI came to the realization that the very core of consciousness is the ability to name things, it is the unit of thoughts (like: \x93oh there\x92s a flower!\x94). And to do that, one needs to do two things: to differentiate and to generalize. To differentiate to set them apart (let\x92s say: a flower from a stone). To generalize to make assumptions, predictions and statements (\x93The flowers won\x92t be there in winter.\x94). Differentiations can only be done by assigning properties to them (\x93The flowers are colorful, temperature-sensitive organic beings. Stones are grey, mineral things.\x94). Generalization is then done along the properties (\x93Flowers are all things that are colorful, organic beings.\x94) Assuming, that there\x92s no natural order or set of properties made for mankind by nature, we also had to define the properties (\x93Color is if it looks like when you look at a forest in autumn compared to when it\x92s fog.\x94). I was puzzled because to define properties, one needs already a concept of things (or how would you know what a forest or fog is). I really thought that\x92s the big mystery and the godly nature of mankind that we make the decision to structure. To say: this is this color and that is not. And that it is amazing that we all come to pretty much the same set of reality. I remember that a friend of mine told me about the concept of constructivism and I think it merged with the first few pages of Terrence McKenna\x92s \x93Foods of the Gods\x94 which I read recently and the classes in political economy that I\x92m taking. But how all the inputs synthesized almost by themselves and in such a high rate was truly amazing.\r\n\r\n+ 3:00 (15:20) \x96 Escorted by Police\r\nDuring all this time, I was walking on the trail that was getting busier and busier. There was a constant, intense stream of thoughts like the one about constructivism that required all my mental power. I wonder if I looked strange or \x93tweaking\x94 during this phase. The people I kept greeting (a habit in the rural parts of the country where I live) did not seem to be bothered. I even was joking with a young mother with her one year old and I remember her laughing with me. However, after approximately one hour, I had to go past the water club I\x92m member of since I\x92m a child. Up to three months before, I had a leading position in the club, so I knew I had to greet everybody I would see \x96 something I did not exactly feel fit for. There was an event going on, there were people all over the place, all dressed-up in the same sports gear and setting a dragon boat up. I hesitated but decided to walk past quick and planned to pretend to hurry on to a train (the station was now not far away). Strangely, I recognized nobody, so I kept on walking towards the station, bought some water (realizing how hard I\x92m tripping while trying to make sense of my purse and coins) and walked a few minutes to sit at the border of the lake. \r\n\r\nAfter a while, I desperately needed to pee and headed back to the boat house. It seemed to be empty, none of the guys from before were there and it seemed safe to have a leak. There I met F., a girl that is competing for the Olympics and I chit-chatted a little bit about training sessions and how she manages to train three times a day and work at the same time. It was surprisingly easy to talk even though, I was still tripping pretty hard. It seemed that whenever my brain was not in overdrive pondering existential ontological questions, the visuals took over. There was this red-green echo-shadow superimposed on her but my talk seemed to be pretty coherent (I even told her a week later about my state then and ask, if I acted strangely. She said, I was perfectly normal.). Then another guy I knew, who rents out the dragon boats, arrived and told me that the guys I saw earlier were the police corps of the town where I\x92m now living (that is some 40 km / 25 miles away). I joked, that they don\x92t have to pursue me across county borders for my occasional weed consumption, and I\x92d better leave. But just as I went upstairs the door burst open and I found myself in front of twenty police guys, all having this distinct super healthy, short-hair, eager-alert look. \r\n\r\nI thought it would be a good idea to go to the bathroom in order to prevent unnecessary contact but they were all heading to the toilet as well. I found this hilarious standing beside these swat-team-like guys while the toilet bowl morphed, changing color from red to green constantly. I finished, rushed out, shook my head in disbelieve and decided to made my way back home. I knew it will take me an solid hour to walk and I started to feel that I was coming down, anticipating the great afterglow that always comes with shrooms.\r\n\r\n+ 4:30 (16:50) \x96 The Way Back\r\nI felt a little bit exhausted, sweaty and pale, there were still thoughts, ideas and questions running through my brain, but at a slower rate and less intensity. I pondered on the way people make decisions and how that is an almost godly act. And that one should decide with joy and a positive curiosity. And that to not decide is a cowardly act. The sun was getting lower and set the surrounding marshland and board of the lake in a soft, autumn light. I felt at one with the world, clear but still under the influence of the mushroom. Some half kilometer ( a third of a mile) short of the cottage I climbed a look-out, smoked a cigarette. The marsh and the lake looked just beautiful in the autumn light, and so was life.\r\n\r\n+ 5:30 (17:50) \x96 Coming Home\r\nAfter having arrived home, I smoked another joint, that brought the mushroomy feeling a little bit back. But an hour later, I felt back to baseline. My ex-girlfriend had texted while I was on my walk, asking if she can come to visit me. I was happy to hear that, picked her up some hours later and we did not talk much about our relationship and just enjoyed the calm setting. I worried a little bit that all the revelations during that trip might be lost, for around midnight it felt somewhat like I had not tripped.\r\n\r\nThe weeks after\r\nThis was actually a baseless fear. For the next few weeks, I was having small d\xe9j\xe0-vues on strings of thoughts or ideas that I had during the walk, and then followed these strings again or tried to reconstruct them. I enjoy walking way more now and opt to walk instead of taking public transportation more frequently. For me, it was one of the most philosophical and inspiring trips and I think I got an answer to the main question - the one on decisions. The effect felt was almost double of what I expected considering the dose and age of the mushrooms, but it was just perfect.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, the mushroom has indeed an magical component. It gives one what one needs and has a strong and determined way to do that. \r\nTake care!"
61263,Piecing Together the Shattered Parts of My Ego,Hypersphere,"Huasca Brew (Syrian Rue & M. tenuiflora), & B. caapi & Mushrooms - P. cubensis","\nBear with me, as I piece together the shattered parts of my ego and write this report.\r\n\r\nT+0:00: Mimosa hostilis 13 grams + Syrian rue 3 grams\r\n\r\nT+16:00 Yellow Banisteriopsis caapi 15 grams + Psilocybe cubensis 1.5 grams\r\n\r\nAge/Sex: 22, male\r\nWeight: 120 pounds\r\nYear of experience: 2007\r\n\r\nPrevious experience:\r\nI am very experienced with a variety of psychedelic drugs, having used a variety of tryptamines and phenethylamines. Mushrooms are the ally I am most comfortable with and I had combined 1 to 3 grams of mushrooms with 1 to 3 grams of syrian rue with positive results several times in the past. I had one prior experience mixing mushrooms and caapi (Erowid experience ID = 57698). I had attempted the Mimosa/Rue mix once before using 2 grams of rue and 5 grams of Mimosa bark but this had proved very weak and left little impression on me.\r\n\r\nNo medications or other plants/herbs had been used in the previous week except for Cannabis and yerba mate which are an all-day-every-day thing for me usually. As a precaution only MAOI compatible food was eaten for two days prior and one day after the combined experiences. Consumption of yerba mate was limited to two cups daily during this period as I didn\x92t want to risk developing a headache as some people have described.\r\n\r\nThe experience (written in the lingering aftermath): \r\nYesterday already seems like a world away so I\x92d better write it down now before it fades. I had worked up the courage and felt psychologically ready to enter the world of Ayahuasca analogue brews. Under the advise of another member I was going to use the combination of syrian rue seeds and mimosa hostilis root bark.\r\n\r\nA friend had recommended the combination of syrian rue seeds and Mimosa hostilis root bark. He told me \'20 grams of mimosa, cooked three times, and possibly up to 10 grams of rue \'tea\' boiled down to one shot. Very intense, and I think a good starting dose.\' At this point I should mention that this is FAR ABOVE what anyone who is not very extremely experienced with psychedelics should contemplate taking. He was recommending this dosage to me as the full, immersive, mind-shattering kind of \'introduction\'.\r\n\r\nAfter reading some freaky reports of people apparently tripping balls on as little as eight grams, I decided to scale down the dosages somewhat. This might have been a mistake, as during the experience I felt no fear and could gave gone deeper. There was this little voice in the back of my head that said \'Okay, that looks like a lot of mimosa bark in the pot, that should be enough\'? Ignore that voice. As Terence McKenna says, when in doubt, double the dosage.\r\n\r\nI ended up making a brew of 13 grams of shredded Mimosa hostilis with 3 grams of syrian rue seeds lovingly sprinkled into the boiling concoction. I boiled the plant materials twice, adding some peppermint and stevia the second time to help with the taste (haha, nothing\x92s gonna cover the taste of this stuff!). I combined the two extracts and boiled it down to around 2/3 of a cup of the most vile tasting purple alien blood ever. Tongue shudderingly bitter. Every sip screamed \'POISON\'. I combined the two extracts and boiled it down to around 2/3 of a cup of the most vile tasting purple alien blood ever. Tongue shudderingly bitter. Every sip screamed \'POISON\'. Drinking the brew took an amount of determination and around half an hour. Although there was definate stomach tightness from drinking the brew, it never evolved into an actual nauseated feeling, and I didn\x92t purge thoughout the experience.\r\n\r\nIt was around the ten minute mark, when I was only about half way through the cup of tea, that I began to feel the effects come on. From there it was all steeply uphill to la-la land. After 20 minutes my sense of time stopped working, and around thirty minutes I laid down in my bed because I was totally fucked. There was an intense dissociation, I could feel my physical body being dissolved and digested by the drug, like I was blowing away in the wind particle by particle. Pure energy poured through me, and I found I could control literally every thought, every emotion, every slight muscle response in my body.\r\n\r\nThe rush was so intense I would keep involuntarily clenching up my muscles as if to resist the push of the drug. Then I would notice my clenched muscles and consciously relax them all, reaching very deep states of content. My thoughts flashed through my mind in waves, and I\x92d see each thought as a fleeting, moving flash of colour in my mind. Open eye visuals consisted of a crawling motion and tracers when I waved my hands. The OEVs I found very much like mushrooms but the feeling of this drug was quite unlike mushrooms. The DMT gave a very high frequency buzzing feeling that I found more reminiscent of the cosmic LSD than the earthy mushrooms.\r\n\r\nI began to come down somewhat from the peak of the high. It took me about fifteen minutes just to figure out the time. First step was remembering the current time.\r\n\'It\x92s 9:00 now\' I would repeat to myself.\r\n\r\nSo I thought about this for a long time, and in the mean time went to the washroom and came back to my room. I had now progressed to knowing that I had ingested the brew at 7:30. Not only that, I stil remembered that it was 9:00 now. Quite an accomplishment, remembering two numbers at once! After a further several minutes of thought I came to the brilliant conclusion that an hour and a half had passed.\r\n\r\nBut wait? All that in only an hour and a half? It didn\x92t seem possible. The time distortion had been so severe, I couldn\x92t accept at first that so little time had passed. I\x92d set aside several hours to be high and now less than two hours had passed and I\x92d already been blasted into space and come back to earth. It was perplexing. On mushrooms I\x92d just be peaking, and here I was coming into a very pleasant plateau instead.\r\n\r\nThere was an almost ridiculously heady euphoria at this stage. Like a good dose of MDMA, except of course for the visuals. I was feeling very very empathetic and at this stage concluded \'This drug is nothing but love.\'\r\n\r\nFor another couple hours the experience tailed off, and it was clear to me that the DMT peak was long gone, and it was only really the rue I was feeling now. Rue\x92s a very interesting drug, it seems very strongly antidepressant. All the fear and anxiety circuits in my brain were just switched off.\r\n\r\nI came to thinking about the differences between rue and caapi. One of the things this Mimosahuasca brew impressed on me is that both the Mimosa and the Rue are male entities. They aren\x92t particularly comforting, or nurturing. It may be a rough ride. But there\x92s this sense of total power, in a testosterone/adrenaline kind of way. Total exhileration, inflation, power trip. These plants are not here to cuddle with me, but if I can flow with them its an incredible rush. The Mimosahuasca brew struck me as a very powerful drug \x96 a drug with healing properties, yes, but still a drug.\r\n\r\nTo me caapi seems a much more medicinal plant. Caapi is going to heal me, and she is a motherly, caring, nurturing plant (although like any good mother she\x92s not going to hold me back when the stream of life gets too intense). Rue doesn\x92t mind if I\x92m just looking to get high. Caapi is more demanding of respect than the rue. On the comedown of this trip I smoked a lot of potent ganja and some hash as well, and this really brought out the euphoric side of the brew.\r\n\r\nI had a rather bad sleep that night, I don\x92t know if I was ever really asleep or just spent the whole night tossing and turning in a kind of waking dream state. \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, though I felt reasonably rested and in a good mood in the morning. The afterglow from rue brews usually lasts a day or two for me. I went to a rather exhausting lab session, and when I came home decided more exploration was in order. The Mimosahuasca had raised my confidence (and arrogance?) levels regarding MAOI bearing plants.  I was going to take caapi today, and I thought I could handle it. I thought I was stronger than this drug, and that the previous night had demonstrated that. I WAS WRONG. I was going to take caapi today, and I thought I could handle it. I thought I was stronger than this drug, and that the previous night had demonstrated that. I WAS WRONG.\r\n\r\nI boiled up 15 grams of yellow caapi with 1.5 grams of Psilocybe cubensis stems. The plant materials were boiled twice with peppermint and stevia added to the second boiling just as I had done with the Mimosahuasca. The Psilohuasca brew came out a funny creamy-yellow colour. The taste was definitely better than the Mimosahuasca. The caapi has a somewhat unsettling alkaloidal aftertaste but it much more tolerable than the Mimosa. It just tastes like really terrible tea. I was really quite curious as to how the brew would compare to the Mimosahuasca, and also hoping that the MAOIs would take care of any tolerance issues dosing two days in a row (in retrospect \x96 no concerns on this point).\r\n\r\nAgain I drank the brew in about half an hour but this time it look longer to come on. My sense of time remained intact for a good 45 minutes after starting to drink the tea. This was around 12:30 and I knew I had to go back to the university around 3:30 to mark some final lab data (we were running TLC plates and my group was relying on me to come in that afternoon when they had finished running and mark the positions on the TLC paper before the signals faded). Somehow I thought I had enough time to trip balls and still come down and go do this lab stuff*\r\n* Doing too many psychedelics can mess up your sense of time\r\n\r\nMaybe it was because I had tripped and come back in two hours the day before, but somehow I was expecting to be relatively back to reality within three hours. Silly rabbit! Around 1:30 I looked at the clock and thought \'Okay, I\x92m totally tripping right now but that\x92s okay, it\x92s still two hours before I have to go.\' But instead of slacking off, this trip kept getting deeper and deeper. I was getting into some really deep trains of thought, rather depressing ones actually. CEVs of plane dogfights from WWII and elite SS soldiers marching in lines. I felt all my social obligations and expectations to be shackles on me, and wondered why I forced myself to be miserable so much of the time just to please other people. Suddenly it\x92s 3:30 and I\x92m tripping harder than ever, what am I going to do?\r\n\r\nThe caapi vine was making it very clear to me that THE HEALING ISN\x92T OVER YET. All I wanted to do is lay there and try to keep sane as I watched the ceiling writhe and twist. But no, I had to start screwing myself up to going out into the world and dealing with shit. I began to get quite anxious. After a while I noticed a thick foamy spittle in my mouth, which about three seconds later became an intense need to vomit. Not that there was really anything in my stomach, but I did manage to throw up/spit up/blow out my nose vast amounts of foamy mucous (yes isn\x92t that pleasant). Alright, fine, so I\x92m getting rid of all the accumulated poisons in my body. Well and good. But I\x92m supposed to be finishing my lab right now! Panic.\r\n\r\nA second wave of purging comes over me. After it passes I see this little dead ladybug that\x92s been on my bathroom floor for a couple days. But wait! It\x92s moving, wriggling it\x92s legs around! I\x92m so messed up that for a while I actually entertain the notion that I somehow brought this ladybug back to life. So I\x92m thinking about this ladybug, helpless on it\x92s back, should I flip it over? Should I give it another chance at life? I look closer. It\x92s not alive at all. Rather there\x92s another bug chewing it\x92s heart out. The wriggling legs I saw were the legs of a different bug entirely. This freaked me out and disgusted me a lot, but was a very good metaphor for how I was feeling at that exact moment in time. Like the world was a filthy insect chewing away at my vital organs.\r\n\r\nSo I finally get myself together and leave the house, another 45 minutes have passed what with the puking my guts out and all. Before leaving I look in the mirror and see my massive pupils and flesh white and pasty, drained of blood. Great. Everything should go smoothly, as long as no one looks as my saucer-sized pupils. I still can\x92t believe I\x92m about to go into university while +++ tripping and just having purged on Psilohuasca. I must be crazy.\r\n\r\nOn the walk over I\x92m still screwing myself up to what I have to do, it becomes a game almost. There was an undeniable thrill at the thought of trying to navigate a normal every-day learning situation whilst having one of the most intense trips I\x92d had in a long time. I mean, I\x92ve done lots of things whilst high on psychedelics. Just never biochemistry lab stuff. There\x92s no reason I shouldn\x92t be able to do it. I just can\x92t fuck up. It\x92ll be really bad if I fuck up. I imagined suddenly puking a bunch of Psilohuasca all over my TLC plate. Yes, that would be hard to explain to my lab partners, wouldn\x92t it?\r\n\r\nI have to cross this overpass with a train station just before I get to the University, and I\x92m surpised to see one of my lab partners walking across the overpass at exactly the same time as me, but in the opposite direction.\r\nShe waves me over and says \'You aren\x92t going to check the lab data now, are you?\'\r\nAlright, just play it cool, I say to myself. No one else knows what\x92s going on inside you\x92re head.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I\x92m going there now\' I reply to her.\r\nShe explains that she had just gone and checked the data, so that I don\x92t need to go now.\r\n\r\nWhat? I don\x92t have to go? Hallelujah! My prayers have been answered!\r\n\r\nNow I know how hard it is not to tell this cute girl you\x92re tripping balls on Psilohuasca, but just keep your mouth shut. She doesn\x92t need to know. I\x92d be a lot of hassle to explain. It\x92s too difficult to explain the concept of psilohuasca even when straight. Plus then she might think you\x92re some kind of freak. Who does a bunch of psychedelics and then goes to lab still tripping anyways? What\x92s wrong with me? Does she know I\x92m on drugs? I think she knows. Well maybe not. I say goodbye to her and head off before making a fool out of myself.\r\n\r\nSo now I\x92m walking home, feeling very relieved, and kind of thinking that the caapi just \'arranged\' things so that I wouldn\x92t have to go into the university. I mean, what are the chances that my lab partner would spontaneously decide to check the data that I was supposed to be gathering, and not only that but I would run into her just after she checked the data, thus saving my poor schizophrenic mind from having to deal with it? Synchronicity at its finest.\r\n\r\nI end up going for a walk in a park near my house because I\x92m still tripping very hard and walking is calming me down a little bit. There was this puddle of murky milky brown water flowing out of a parking lot and into the road. I spent a while standing and watching the beautiful swirling patterns made by the flow of the silty water. Hopefully no one was watching me as I probably looked pretty stupid completely dazzled and enthralled by a scummy puddle of water. \r\n\r\nI\x92m walking past this elementary school and these five kids start giggling. You know, the \'lets try really hard not to laugh at this person as they go by\' kind of giggling. Maybe I looked funny. I think I gave them the biggest contact high of their lives, because the closer I got the more and more hysterical their laughter became. Five kids killing themselves laughing at me whilst I\x92m tripping my ass off was a bit much to handle. What should I do? Well, I could just ignore them, pretend I can\x92t here. That\x92s what an adult should do, right? Instead I decided to throw a snowball at them. This only resulted in another wave of hysterical giggling and a couple snow balls half-heartedly thrown back at me.\r\n\r\n\'You suck! You call that a throw!\' I yell back at them\r\n\r\nThen I feel really weird. I\x92m insulting children and having a snowball fight whilst tripping. Is this what normal people do? Definitely not.\r\n\r\nI continue walking and there\x92s this feeling that I\x92ve regressed to infancy. I was nothing but a big baby. To further this notion, I hear a baby screaming. This fat lady is walking down the block pushing her kid in a stroller, and the kid is bawling and bawling without end. I mean literally for five minutes I watched this lady plodding along, her infant screaming, clearly audible an entire field away. It was surreal. Don\x92t you want to try and comfort your child? Are you hoping that by letting him cry now, his batteries will wind down?\r\n\r\nI was feeling so many intense emotions at once I didn\x92t know what to do with myself. I half wanted to die, because there was so much destruction all around me that was caused by humans. Senseless destruction. Like this area of trees I enjoy going to, but a lot of stupid stoners hang out there. They come and they break big branches and limbs off the trees for no real reason, just for some stupid entertainment because they are drunk and stoned. So the trees are scarred, and bleeding and wounded, and some even have spray paint graffiti on them. It\x92s no longer the comforting clean natural place it once was, where I could smoke a bowl under a spruce tree standing up, with the branches coming down to ground level all around me. Now all the lower branches are snapped off.\r\n\r\nThe other half of me felt more intensely alive than ever. Life, squared, cubed, to the ninth degree. Being so intensely alive that every breath hurts to take. The late afternoon sun was warm and comforting. I thought about the sun, and whether it could be considered to be God. Is the sun powerful enough to be God, I asked. To which the response was \'No, he\x92s gone behind a cloud.\'\r\n\r\nSeeing as the sun was behind a cloud I began to get rather chilly and headed home. It was now around 4 and a half hours since beginning to drink the tea. I was still +++ tripping, but definitely beginning to repair. I didn\x92t trust myself with any food yet, but after coming home I warmed up and began to slowly drink a cup of yerba mate. I passed on an offer of dinner with the excuse I was feeling kind of sick, which I suppose was true in a way.\r\n\r\nIt is now seven hours after ingestion and I\x92m mostly back to normal again. I feel very weak and shaky though, probably partly from the lack of food. But the caapi + mushrooms was not a recreational experience, I\x92m shaking now because it took me so far out. I feel I\x92ve subjected myself to rather severe stress today. \r\n\r\nWas it a good idea taking the Psilohuasca today? No. Am I glad I took it? Yes.\r\nDid I have a sufficiently deep experience this time? Almost too deep. I went right over the cataract and flailed around on the other side, staring back to the calm and placid reality I\x92d so willingly smashed.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading."
58614,Hinduistic Divination,Baker,Mushrooms - P. cubensis,"\nThe set: I had had my mushrooms sitting around for a while in my house waiting for an appropriate time to take a dose. I had already experienced a low 2g dose with my partner and experienced some mind blowing connection, love, empathy and of course sex and since had been waiting for my tolerance to drop back down and try a more intense heroic dose. I have previously tried a maximum of 9g tampensis, however these were cubensis, and noticeably more potent. I usually find many similarities between mushrooms and MDMA, a lot more so then LSD and they often leave me with the same afterglow, same euphoria and same sociability + psychedelic soup of confusion, I like to refer to as \x93mushed\x94.\r\n\r\nPsychologically I was at some crossroads. I was mid semester of my neuroscience/psychology degree and had just failed psychology by 4 marks, (been a little too distracted that semester). So I was deciding what to do with my life, and wondering if I\x92m in the right course. If I want to take up a career in dancing, pursue my passion for writing, or put more time into the production of music. I was unemployed at the time and hadn\x92t worked for about 5 months (unless uni counts as work). I still don\x92t have my licence and these were basically the only self esteem issues facing me at the time, I was a little apprehensive but basically ready for a spiritually enlightening experience.\r\n\r\nThe setting: At home, I usually live near campus in the country, but was visiting my parents for the holidays and decided the comfort of home was a very good place to experience a spiritual trip as it\x92s a place for me that is recognised as safe and hold some nostalgic attributes to it as well. I also had a little head cold that wouldn\x92t leave, and when it\x92s winter, the warmth of the inside is very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Trip: I sat and ate 5g at my computer desk as I chatted away on msn, general ranting, and a discussion with some friends so they knew what I was attempting and to exercise a little caution, but just to know that I had some background protection, as I\x92d chosen to trip by myself to avoid any possible social anxieties. Not that I\x92m the type to get social anxiety easy at all, but people tend to distract my thought patterns when I have to change the direction of my thought to communicate properly. My ideas so commonly don\x92t convey easily into English when I\x92m on a high dose of psychedelics.\r\n\r\nSo about half an hour later I get up to go watch some TV and take another 2g to consider eating once I get upstairs. After about 10 minutes I get paranoid about forgetting about them or losing them as the visuals start to take effect, and I start overanalysing the tv show I was watching. It became overwhelmingly easy to relate the scenarios to my life and absorb points of view as apposed to language. \r\n\r\nAbout 30 minutes later I was tripping quite hard and beginning to experience a bit of nervous anxiety, as my thoughts would erratically jump. I was inable to find comfort in my altered state. I headed downstairs and decided to go outside for a bit. As I headed downstairs the walls tried to eat me as they kept stretching and closing in towards me, but it was all in good fun. I wasn\x92t really scared at all, just feeling a little discomfort.\r\n\r\nI stepped outside and was blasted by some fresh winter air, and was comforted by this soft glow that looked as if it was a dream. The road and grass shined and appeared to be softened like when they put the cloth filter over the camera for a show like the bold and the beautiful. Everything looked nice and just wobbled, grew, shrunk and melted, I even noticed a strobe like effect in my vision as I\x92d notice points of interest and my vision would dart around the place. I went running down the road, which eventually turned into a skip and then weird flowing movements, basically whatever I felt like, it always feels so good sober, and thus even better now. I was lost in the beauty of my body, my energy and the world.\r\n\r\nI danced my way around the neighbourhood until I arrived back at home to go have my shower. By this point the trip was beginning to take full grips of me, so I went to have a shower, a place of usual heavy insights. Before I had my shower I looked in the mirror. HAHA, the mirror got me good, it felt as if I connected with myself on the other side, and we swapped. I experienced everything as a reflection. Suddenly I was just a reflection of the world that existed around me, a mirror of perception, and an overwhelming sense of quantum physics washed over me, I was now placed in the realm of limitless possibilities. As the walls were no longer white and began to pulse many different colours, like psychedelic acne all over the walls, and the thoughts of me eating an orange and confusing it with a certain song were all very possible as well. Walls ceased to exist after this and I forgot where I was standing, only to look back into the mirror, catch my own eyes again, and instantly everything was normal again. I stepped back from the mirror a little shaken up by the experience and stepped into the shower.\r\n\r\nI was in there for a good half an hour, indulging in multiple body sensations and really appreciating the warmth, cleaning out my lungs, stretching muscles, giving my body a full workout. A fair bit of yoga and I honestly felt like a Hindu in the shower, I\x92ve never felt that attached to that religion before, but it took on a whole cultural experience, from the far reaches of India, A man was now indulging in western shower. I felt a strong cross spirituality.\r\n\r\nIt\x92s funny how each different psychedelic drug seems to remind me of my spiritual readings. LSD has a strong Buddhist edge, Salvia has a strong Taoist edge, Mescaline definitely has a connection with the peyote religion (duh), 2c\x92s feel like Greek mythology and the teachings of Don Juan. Though have a similarity with mescaline as it too felt mythological. Now mushrooms make me feel Hindu, in an enchanted sense. Although. ergotamine\x92s still seem to have the strongest grip on my spirituality, being predominantly into Buddhist teachings. These mind states were revealed to me before they were followed up with readings by the way.\r\n\r\nUnrelated but still interesting: Whenever I eat apples on LSD they always cause me a very unique mindfuck of their own, and I have even philosophised the concepts of Adam and Eve\x92s garden of Eden was just a blissful nirvana of ignorance, chaos had not yet ensued until they had strayed away from their instincts and had hit on the world of experimentation that thus exposed them to a taught ego and thus the tree of knowledge, created sin. As sin makes us aware of existence and thus we question the fragments of reality rather then let our instincts justify it for us. I believe there is a lot of worldly understandings to be found within the depths of our own instincts, and only through understanding the inner workings of our bodies are we able to understand the world externally. \r\n\r\nAnyway, moving along, I got out of the shower and had another go at the mirror again. It lacked the same intensity as it did before, which left me a little disappointed, but was an excuse to move on and head back downstairs, into my room. Not before getting lost in another mirror giggling at my own character, lack of balance, and the points of view of reality that make this world so worth living in, mmm contentment.\r\n\r\nI heard my computer beep as someone nudged me on msn, one of my tripper friends had just gotten home so I decided to have a chat with him, but holy crap\x85 I couldn\x92t even spell dyslexic, let alone read it. The whole screen was just a jumble of letters as my eyes would dart reading one word at a time. \x93Trip, home, what, sorry, yellow\x94 was an example of the way I would read things. Then I noticed to the right of me an envelope from my university, so I opened it and attempted to read it, wow\x85 not easy at all. I see three words, English, trouble and dissatisfied. I read a few more words and try to put together this jumble of endless possibilities for what they could mean, let me just tell you it was plain retarded.\r\n\r\nSo I put on a mix tape of some drill n bass and some psy trance and laid down in my bed with the light on, because I couldn\x92t see a thing with them turned off. I was in bed contemplating my life, my love for family, my love for friends, my reliability, compassion for others, my positions, my options in life, everything. Although I must admit, my thoughts were quite erratic and very difficult to hold onto, this is where I find LSD or even mescaline a far better spiritual tool.\r\n\r\nThen I started to feel quite sick, like I was going to purge soon. Then I looked in the corner of my room on the ceiling and noticed this red colour which was confused for the colour of blood which upon investigation turned out to be the paint thinning and the red wood underneath shining through, it was enough to bring back the story my mum had told me earlier about a girl dying of a tumour in our house, and I started experiencing very negative vibes from the room. As I realised I\x92d lived in this room for the last 3 years at school, which is when coincidentally my grades started to drop (though, it\x92s a lot of effort changing rooms). My sister lived there 7 years before me and had ended up with chronic fatigue\x85 hmmm, whatever.\r\n\r\nI left the room and dry heaved into the toilet and then lay on the floor in the hallway, My eyes were rolling into my skull at this point and I felt like sleeping. I felt well on the verge of passing out as well, like I\x92d done a lot of mushrooms and my body wasn\x92t appreciating it. Anyway, I maintained consciousness, though I later regret it, as I feel I may have experienced a breakthrough dissociative state, similar to the alternate realms I have visited on DXM and ketamine. Oh well, the thoughts became very peaceful as I made up my mind to continue with uni, just change my subject choices for the next semester, find a new job, continue my music production and just use my time more resourcefully.\r\n\r\nEuphoria began to wash over me as the intense desire to pass out left me, while I progressively got an increasing desire to actually pass out (thus the regret\x85 perhaps I never was meant to pass out, it was just about letting my ego do what it wanted). Anyway, peace settled and I danced in the dark in front of the mirror and was able to push my bodies to extreme limits, stretch and dance in an orgasmic fluid motion, I was impressing the shit out of myself. \r\n\r\nI wrote a list of things to do and things to remember, played with some music, and settled down to some morning Christian viewing on TV as I settled into that amazing body high and clarity that is trademark to the mushroom experience. Eventually went to sleep by about 7am as I watched the sun rise and had quite a peaceful sleep. Woke up feeling a minor sleep disturbance, but on the whole in a good mood, which later bloomed into a euphoria that lasted me the rest of the week."
